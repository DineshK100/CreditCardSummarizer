creditcardagreement_1368.TXT,"First Command Bank Visa Cardholder Agreement (Platinum/Classic)

The person(s) (""Cardholder,"" whether one or more) who signed and 
returned the Application for a Visa (""Application"") has requested First 
Command Bank (""Bank"") to extend to Cardholder open-end credit. The 
term ""Cardholder"" means each person who signed and returned the 
Application and any other person who has agreed to be responsible for 
the Account (defined below). As used in this Agreement, the term 
�person� means an individual or an entity, as applicable. By Cardholder's 
use of the credit card (""Card""), furnished by Bank in reliance in part upon 
the information supplied by Cardholder in the Application, Cardholder 
agrees with Bank as follows: 

1. Using the Account. Cardholder has accepted the revolving tri-party 
account (""Account"") made available to Cardholder by Bank. Cardholder 
may use the Card to purchase or lease goods or services, or pay 
amounts that Cardholder owes, wherever the Card is honored (""Credit 
Purchases""). Cardholder may also use the Card to obtain cash loans 
(""Cash Advances"") from any financial institution that accepts the Card. 
Cardholder agrees that the Account will not be used to access gambling 
web sites or to purchase illegal goods or services. Bank may refuse to 
process any transaction that Bank believes may violate this Agreement. 
If Cardholder provides the Account number to make a purchase or 
obtain an advance without presenting the Card (such as for a mail order 
or telephone purchase), or if Cardholder authorizes someone else to 
make a charge to the Account, Cardholder's obligation to pay will be the 
same as if the Card itself was used. Cash Advances also may be ob-
tained through use of the Card (a) upon execution of a written request of 
Cardholder in a form furnished by any financial institution that is a 
member, alone or in association with others, of Visa, Inc. or (b) upon 
Cardholder's execution of a written separate agreement with Bank for a 
Visa overdraft financial agreement, if offered by Bank. All Credit Pur-
chases and Cash Advances are effected at the option of the retail 
merchant (""Seller"") and/or cash advancing financial institution respec-
tively, and Bank shall not be responsible for refusal by any Seller or 
cash advancing financial institution to honor the Card or any ""Related 
Card,"" as defined in paragraph 2 below. 

2. Obligations on the Account. Cardholder (jointly or severally if more 
than one) promises to pay Bank at the address specified on the periodic 
statement (see paragraph 5 below) for all Credit Purchases and Cash 
Advances, together with any Finance Charge as herein provided, plus 
any other charges permitted by this Agreement, all such payments must 
be in lawful money of the United States of America. Cardholder will pay 
in their equivalent in U.S. dollars all charges in a foreign currency, which 
equivalence will be determined by reference to the amount in U.S. 
dollars. Bank shall have paid in good faith to the person presenting the 
item to Bank. Cardholder shall be liable and agrees to pay Bank for 
Credit Purchases made by, or for Cash Advances extended to, Card-
holder or anyone else using the Card unless the use of such Card is by a 
person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, implied, 
or apparent authority for such use and (b) from which Cardholder rece-
ives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally 
liable, and agrees to pay, for all Credit Purchases and Cash Advances 
obtained through the use of any other Card bearing Cardholder's Ac-
count number that has been issued to another person by reason of such 
person being a member of Cardholder's family, or otherwise issued upon 
Cardholder's request (all such Cards bearing the same Account number 
hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). Subject to any mandato-
ry provisions of applicable law, all payments made by Cardholder will be 
applied to the balances on Cardholder's Account in the manner set forth 
later in this Agreement. 

3. Credit Limit. Bank will inform Cardholder from time to time of the 
maximum amount of debt (""Credit Limit"") that may be outstanding in the 
Account at any time, and Bank, in its sole discretion may adjust the 
Credit Limit from time to time. Cardholder agrees not to use or permit the 
use of the Card in any manner that would cause the outstanding balance 
in the Account ever to exceed the Credit Limit. If Cardholder attempts a 
transaction which results in Cardholder�s total outstanding balance (plus 
authorizations) exceeding Cardholder's Credit Limit, Bank may: (a) 
permit the transaction without raising Cardholder's Credit Limit; (b) 
permit the transaction and treat the amount of the transaction that is 
more than the Credit Limit as immediately due; or (c) refuse to permit the 
transaction. If Bank refuses to permit the transaction, Bank may advise 
the person who attempted the transaction that it has been refused. If 
Bank has previously permitted Cardholder to exceed Cardholder's Credit 
Limit, it does not mean that Bank will permit Cardholder to exceed 
Cardholder's Credit Limit on a subsequent date. Bank may designate 
that only a portion of Cardholder's Credit Limit is available for Cash 
Advances. If Cardholder exceeds that limit, Cardholder will be consi-
dered to have exceeded the Credit Limit for all purposes under this 
Agreement. 

4. Notices. Bank will send periodic statements and any other notices to 
Cardholder at the address shown in Bank's files. If this is a joint Account, 
Bank can send periodic statements and notices to either Cardholder. 
Cardholder promises to inform Bank promptly, in writing, of any changes 
in Cardholder's address. Cardholder authorizes Bank, or anyone acting 
on Bank's behalf, to call or send a text message to any number Card-
holder provides or to any number where Bank may reasonably believe 
Bank can contact cardholder, including calls to mobile, cellular, or 
similar devices, and calls using automatic telephone dialing systems 
and/or pre-recorded messages, or to send an email to any address 
where Bank reasonably believes Bank can contact Cardholder. Calls 
and messages may be made for any lawful purpose, including but not 
limited to: suspected fraud or identity theft; obtaining information; Card-
holder's account transactions or servicing; collecting on Cardholder's 
account; and providing Cardholder information about products and 
services. 

5. Periodic Statement. As of the end of each monthly billing cycle, 
Cardholder will be furnished a periodic statement showing, among other 
things, (a) the amount owed (""Previous Balance"") at the beginning of the 
billing cycle, (b) the amount of all Cash Advances, Credit Purchases and 
Finance Charge posted to the Account during the billing cycle, (c) the 
amount of all payments and credits posted to the Account during the 
billing cycle, and (d) the total amount due (""New Balance"") at the end of 
the billing cycle (which amount is the sum of [a] and [b] less [c]), (e) the 
""Minimum Payment,"" and (f) the ""Payment Due Date."" If Cardholder is 
composed of more than one person, only one periodic statement will be 
provided. 

6. Minimum Payment. Cardholder agrees to pay to Bank, on or prior to 
the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, the sum of (a) 
either (i) the entire New Balance or (ii) at Cardholder's option, an amount 
which shall be at least 2.50% of the New Balance (rounded up to the 
nearest dollar) or $50.00, whichever is greater, and (b) any amount that 
is past due and any amount that is over the Credit Limit. If the New 
Balance is less than $50.00, it shall be paid in full. Cardholder may pay 
more than the Minimum Payment, and may at any time pay the full 
amount owing to Bank. If Cardholder pays more than the Minimum 
Payment, Cardholder must still pay the Minimum Payment as reflected 
on the next periodic statement. The Payment Due Date for a billing cycle 
will be not less than twenty-five (25) days after the preceding billing 
cycle ends (the ""Closing Date""). 

7. Annual Fee: Bank does not charge an annual fee for the Card. 

8. Late Payment Fee. If Bank does not receive a payment from Card-
holder in at least the amount of the Minimum Payment within 30 days 
after the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, Bank may 
charge Cardholder a late payment fee in the amount stated below in the 
Table of Charges. Cardholder will only be charged a late payment fee for 
any Minimum Payment which is not paid within 30 days after the Pay-
ment Due Date. 

9. Cash Advance Fee. Each time Cardholder uses the Card or a Con-
venience Check to obtain a Cash Advance, Bank will assess a cash 
advance fee in the amount stated in the Table of Charges. 

10. When Finance Charge Begins. Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account for all Cash Advances from the later of (a) the day the Cash 
Advance is posted to the Account, or (b) the first day of the billing cycle 
in which the Cash Advance is posted until Cardholder pays the transac-
tion(s) in full. For Credit Purchases, Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account if the Cardholder does not pay the New Balance in full by the 
Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement. If Bank adds a 
Finance Charge, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge on all 
amounts Cardholder owes Bank (except ""New Purchases"") from the first 
day of the billing cycle; provided, however, any portion of the New 
Balance subject to a grace period that is paid prior to the expiration of 
the grace period will not be assessed a Finance Charge. For New 
Purchases, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge from the date 
Bank posts the New Purchase to the Account unless Cardholder has 
paid the New Balance in full on the previous periodic statement. A New 
Purchase is one that appears on the periodic statement for the first time. 

11. Calculation of Finance Charge. Bank calculates the Finance 
Charge on the Account by applying the ""Periodic Rate"" (defined below) 
to the ""Average Daily Balance"" of the Account. To obtain the Average 
Daily Balance, Bank starts with the beginning balance of the Account on 
each day, excluding unpaid Finance Charges. Bank adds any Cash 
Advances posted to the Account that day, and any New Purchases, 
unless Cardholder paid the New Balance in full for the previous billing 
cycle by the Payment Due Date. Bank subtracts any credits and pay-
ments (after any unpaid Finance Charges are paid) posted to the Ac-
count that day. This results in the ""Daily Balance."" Then, Bank adds up 
all the Daily Balances for the billing cycle and divides that by the total 
number of days in the billing cycle. This results in the Average Daily 
Balance. The Finance Charge on the Account is calculated by multiply-
ing the Average Daily Balance by the Periodic Rate for Classic which is 
.008542 and the Periodic Rate for Platinum which is .005208 (but 
subject to change from time to time).

Default APR and         18% 
When It Applies         This APR may be applied to Cardholder's 
                        account when the full balance becomes due and 
                        payable and Cardholder has been notified of the 
                        APR increase. 

Paying Interest                Cardholder's Payment Due Date is at least 25 
                        days after the close of each billing cycle. Bank 
                        will not charge any interest on purchases if 
                        Cardholder pays the entire balance by the 
                        Payment Due Date each month. Bank will begin 
                        charging interest on Cash Advances on the 
                        transaction date.

*Bank adds 3% to the Prime Rate to determine Platinum APR (Periodic 
Rate currently .005208). 

For Credit Purchases and Cash Advances which occur on a Platinum 
Account, the APR varies with changes to the Prime Rate. The �Prime 
Rate� is the highest prime rate published in the Money Rates column of 
the Wall Street Journal 30 days before the Closing Date on Cardholder�s 
periodic statement (the �Calculation Date�). On May 1, 2010 the Prime 
Rate was 3.25% therefore the APR was 6.25%. A variable APR will go 
up and down depending on the Prime Rate as of each Calculation Date; 
however, a variable rate APR is subject to change only on the first day of 
each billing cycle. If the Prime Rate and the corresponding APR in-
crease, the Finance Charge also will increase and Cardholder�s Mini-
mum Payment may also increase. The Prime Rate is only a pricing 
index and is not the lowest interest rate available. 

12. Other Payment Terms. All payments received on or before (a) 5 
o'clock p.m. (Fort Worth, Texas time) on Bank's business day at the 
address indicated on the periodic statement, or (b) the closing time of 
the applicable branch if payment is made in person, will be credited to 
the Account as of the date of receipt of payment. If payment is made at 
any other location, credit for the payment may be delayed up to 5 days. 
Bank can accept late or partial payments, as well as payments that are 
marked with ""Paid In Full"" or any other similar language without losing or 
waiving any of Bank�s rights or Cardholder's obligations under this 
Agreement. Payment by check constitutes Cardholder's authorization for 
Bank to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from Cardholder's 
bank to make such payment. Bank is not responsible for any lost or 
stolen cash payments. Payments and credits to the Account will be 
applied in the following order: 

. Unpaid Finance Charge; 
. Late Fee; 
. Cash Advance from previous billing cycle; 
. Credit Purchases from previous billing cycle; 
. Cash Advances from current billing cycle; and 
. Credit Purchases from current billing cycle. 


13. Convenience Checks. Bank may issue ""Convenience Checks"" to 
Cardholder that may be used to access the Account. Use of a Conveni-
ence Check will be treated as a Cash Advance in the amount of the 
Check. Each Convenience Check will contain Cardholder's Account 
Number, and may be used only by the person(s) whose name(s) is/are 
printed on it. Each Convenience Check must be completed and signed in 
the same way as a regular personal check. If Bank provides Conveni-


ence Checks for the Account, Cardholder may not use them to pay any 
amount Cardholder owes under this Agreement. Cardholder agrees that 
Bank need not return Convenience Checks to Cardholder after their use, 
and that, if Cardholder needs evidence of any payment represented by 
the Convenience Check, a photocopy or similar reproduction will be 
satisfactory for such purposes. If Cardholder wishes to prevent payment 
of a Convenience Check, the instructions which Bank provides when the 
Convenience Checks are issued must be followed. In the event payment 
of a Convenience Check has been stopped, Cardholder agrees to hold 
Bank harmless and indemnify Bank for any losses, expenses and costs, 
including attorney's fees incurred by Bank, for preventing payment of 
any Convenience Check. Bank will use its best efforts to stop payment, 
but will incur no liability to Cardholder if it is unable to stop payment on a 
Convenience Check. 

14. Termination. Bank may terminate Cardholder's privileges under this 
Agreement or limit Cardholder's right to make Credit Purchases or 
receive Cash Advances at any time (and list Cardholder's Account in 
warning bulletins in the event of such termination) without any reason or 
without advance notice or resulting liability. If Bank requests, Cardholder 
must return the Card and Convenience Checks to Bank. Cardholder 
agrees that Cardholder will not try to make a Credit Purchase or obtain a 
Cash Advance after Cardholder has been notified that Cardholder's 
privilege to use the Account has been terminated. Cardholder may 
terminate this Agreement at any time. If Cardholder does terminate, all 
Cards and Convenience Checks previously issued on the Account must 
be returned to Bank. If Cardholder telephones Bank with the termination 
request, Bank may require that Cardholder confirm such intent to termi-
nate in writing. Bank's or Cardholder's termination will not affect Card-
holder's existing obligations under this Agreement or Cardholder's 
liability for all charges posted to Cardholder's Account prior to the time 
all Cards and Convenience Checks are returned to Bank. When the 
Account is closed, Cardholder must contact everyone authorized to 
charge transactions to the Account, such as internet service providers, 
health clubs or insurance companies. These transactions may continue 
to be charged to the Account until Cardholder changes the billing. Also, if 
the Bank believes Cardholder has authorized a transaction or is attempt-
ing to use Cardholder�s Account after Cardholder has requested to close 
the Account, Bank may allow the transaction to be charged to the 
Account. If the Account is terminated by Cardholder or by Bank for 
reasons other than Cardholder's default, Cardholder will be required to 
pay the outstanding balance on the Account according to the terms of 
this Agreement immediately prior to such termination. 

15. Default. If (a) Cardholder defaults in any payment required to be 
made on the Account or otherwise violates any provision of this Agree-
ment, or (b) Cardholder dies or seeks to obtain any relief as a debtor in 
any proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor relief law, or 
(c) Cardholder provides Bank with false or misleading information or 
signatures at any time, or (d) Cardholder fails to make any payment or 
perform any promise in any other agreement or obligation that Card-
holder owes Bank, then Cardholder will be in default under this Agree-
ment. Bank, upon such default, may at its election (a) decline to extend 
further credit under this Agreement (and Cardholder agrees not to make 
further Credit Purchases or to obtain further Cash Advances) and (b) 
declare all amounts then owed to Bank by Cardholder immediately due 
and payable, without prior notice or demand of any kind, except as may 
be required by applicable law. After Bank declares all amounts then 
owed to Bank by Cardholder to be due and payable, and terminates 
Cardholder�s credit privileges under the Account Bank, at its option (but 
only after providing to Cardholder notice if such is required by applicable 
law), may increase the Annual Percentage Rate up to 18%, which is the 
Default Rate under the Table of Charges. 

16. Collection Charges. If Cardholder defaults, to the extent permitted 
by applicable law, Cardholder agrees to pay (a) all amounts actually 
incurred by Bank as court costs and attorneys' fees set by a court in 
connection with the collection of amounts due by Cardholder under the 
Account and (b) premiums or other identifiable charges received in 
connection with the permitted sale of insurance. In addition, Bank may 
impose on Cardholder a processing fee of $20.00 if a check provided to 
Bank by Cardholder is dishonored for any reason. The dishonored check 
processing fee may be added to the New Balance and is payable on the 
next following due date, however, such fee will not accrue any Finance 
Charge. 

17. Governing Law. This Agreement is performable in Texas and is 
made pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance 
Code, as amended. THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, AND EN-
FORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL MATTERS ARISING 
OUT OF THE ISSUANCE AND USE OF THE CARD SHALL BE GO-
VERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND, TO THE 
EXTENT APPLICABLE, THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. 

18. Amendment. The terms of this Agreement including, but not limited 
to, the rate or index, formula or provision of law used to compute the 
ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are subject to revision as to current and 
future balances, from time to time, by written notice from Bank to Card-
holder as provided by applicable law. 

19. Telephone Conversations. Cardholder agrees that Bank, its 
agents, or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone 
communications with Cardholder. 

20. Liability for Unauthorized Use. Cardholder may be liable for 
unauthorized use of the Account. If the Card is lost or stolen, or if Card-
holder believes someone is using the Account without proper authority, 
Cardholder must notify Bank immediately by calling 1-800-325-3678. 
Cardholder will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after 
Cardholder notifies Bank of the loss or theft of the Card or Convenience 
Check, or the possible unauthorized use of the Account. Bank may 
terminate or limit access to the Account if Cardholder has notified Bank, 
or if Bank has determined that the Card or Convenience Check may 
have been lost or stolen, or that there may be unauthorized access to 
the Account. Cardholder agrees to provide Bank with complete coopera-
tion in Bank's efforts to recover any stolen Card or Convenience Check 
and amounts due from unauthorized users, and in prosecuting unautho-
rized users. 

21. Bank�s Liability for Failing to Make Transfers. If Bank does not 
complete a transaction to or from the Account on time or in the correct 
amount according to this Agreement, Bank may be liable for Cardhold-
er's losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. Bank will 
not be liable, for instance: (a) if, through no fault of Bank's, the available 
credit is insufficient for the transaction or is unavailable for withdrawal 
(for example, because funds have not been finally collected or are 
subject to legal process); (b) if a computer system, ATM, or point of sale 
terminal did not have enough cash or was not working properly and 
Cardholder knew about the problem when Cardholder started the trans-
action; (c) if Cardholder attempts to use the Account or the Card which 
has not been properly activated; (d) if the Card has been reported as lost 
or stolen, has been suspended by Bank or Bank has reason to believe 
the transaction is not authorized by Cardholder, or if Cardholder is trying 
to defraud Bank; or (e) as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

22. Assignment of Account. Cardholder agrees that Bank may at any 
time assign and transfer Cardholder's Account, this Agreement, and 
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, without Cardholder's 
consent or notice to Cardholder. The person to whom the Account and 
Agreement is assigned shall be entitled to all of Bank's rights under this 
Agreement. 

23. Information Sharing. Cardholder authorizes Bank to share informa-
tion concerning Cardholder and Cardholder�s Account with companies 
related to Bank by common ownership. Cardholder authorizes Bank to 
share information with companies in which Bank has an ownership 
interest, concerning purchases made by Cardholder using Cardholder�s 
Account, for the purpose of obtaining special merchandise offers or 
discounts for Cardholder. Cardholder does not authorize Bank to dis-
close Cardholder�s name, address, telephone number or other personal 
information to these companies. 

24. Credit Reporting Agencies. Bank may give information about 
Cardholder's payment history under this Agreement to other persons or 
companies when permitted by law. Cardholder authorizes Bank to make 
whatever credit or investigative inquiries Bank deems necessary in the 
course of review of any credit extended under this Agreement. A nega-
tive credit report which may affect Cardholder's credit record may be 
submitted to a credit reporting agency if Cardholder fails to keep Card-
holder's promises under this Agreement. 

25. Delay of Rights. Bank can waive or delay enforcement of any of its 
rights under this Agreement without losing them. 

26. Separable Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to 
be invalid or enforceable, the rest of this Agreement will not be affected. 
Cardholder will not be held liable for Finance Charges or other fees and 
charges greater than the maximum allowed by law that applies. 

27. Limitation of Responsibility. Bank will not be responsible for 
merchandise or services purchased by Cardholder with the Card or 
Convenience Check unless required by law. Any refund, adjustment or 
credit allowed by a Seller shall not be cash, but rather be by a credit 
advice to Bank which shall be shown as a credit on the periodic state-
ment. Bank will not be responsible for the refusal of any person to honor 
the Card or Convenience Check or if Cardholder is not able to use the 
Card at an ATM. (a) Bank will not be responsible for merchandise or 
services purchased by Cardholder with the Card or Convenience Check 
unless required by law. Any refund, adjustment or credit allowed by a 
Seller shall not be cash, but rather be by a credit advice to Bank which 
shall be shown as a credit on the periodic statement. Bank will not be 
responsible for the refusal of any person to honor the Card or Conveni-
ence Check or if Cardholder is not able to use the Card at an ATM[; and 
(b) BANK WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO CARDHOLDER FOR DELAYS OR 
MISTAKES RESULTING FROM ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND 
BANK'S CONTROL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTS OF 
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, NATIONAL EMERGENCIES, 
INSURRECTION, WAR, OR RIOTS; THE FAILURE OF MERCHANTS 
TO HONOR THE CARD; THE FAILURE OF MERCHANTS TO PER-
FORM OR PROVIDE SERVICES; COMMUNICATION SYSTEMFAI-
LURES; OR FAILURES OR MALFUNCTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO 
CARDHOLDER'S EQUIPMENT, ANY INTERNET SERVICE, OR ANY 
PAYMENT SYSTEM. IN THE EVENT THAT BANK IS HELD LIABLE 
TO CARDHOLDER, CARDHOLDER WILL ONLY BE ENTITLED TO 
RECOVER CARDHOLDER'S ACTUAL DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT 
SHALL CARDHOLDER BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ANY INDIRECT, 
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (WHETH-
ER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF CARDHOLDER 
HAS ADVISED BANK OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
THIS PROVISION SHALL NOT BE EFFECTIVE TO THE EXTENT 
OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW. 

28. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies. If Cardholder makes a 
transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be converted by 
Visa into a U.S. dollar amount in accordance with the operating regula-
tions or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is 
processed. Currently, those regulations and procedures provide that the 
currency conversion rate to be used is either (a) a wholesale market rate 
or (b) a government-mandated rate in effect one (1) day prior to the 
processing date, increased by one percent (1%) in each case. Visa 
retains this one percent as compensation for performing the currency 
conversion service. The currency conversion rate in effect on the 
processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date 
or the posting date. 

29. USA Patriot Act. Bank is subject to the requirement of the USA 
Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107 56 [signed into law October 26, 2001]) 
(the �Act�) and hereby notifies Cardholder that pursuant to the require-
ments of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify, and record information 
that identifies Cardholder which information includes the name and 
address of Cardholder and other information that will allow such Bank to 
identify Cardholder in accordance with the Act. 

30. Other Agreements. This Agreement supersedes all prior Agree-
ments between Bank and Cardholder governing the use of the Card and 
the Account.

creditcardagreement_1368.TXT,"First Command Bank Visa Cardholder Agreement (Platinum/Classic)

The person(s) (""Cardholder,"" whether one or more) who signed and 
returned the Application for a Visa (""Application"") has requested First 
Command Bank (""Bank"") to extend to Cardholder open-end credit. The 
term ""Cardholder"" means each person who signed and returned the 
Application and any other person who has agreed to be responsible for 
the Account (defined below). As used in this Agreement, the term 
�person� means an individual or an entity, as applicable. By Cardholder's 
use of the credit card (""Card""), furnished by Bank in reliance in part upon 
the information supplied by Cardholder in the Application, Cardholder 
agrees with Bank as follows: 

1. Using the Account. Cardholder has accepted the revolving tri-party 
account (""Account"") made available to Cardholder by Bank. Cardholder 
may use the Card to purchase or lease goods or services, or pay 
amounts that Cardholder owes, wherever the Card is honored (""Credit 
Purchases""). Cardholder may also use the Card to obtain cash loans 
(""Cash Advances"") from any financial institution that accepts the Card. 
Cardholder agrees that the Account will not be used to access gambling 
web sites or to purchase illegal goods or services. Bank may refuse to 
process any transaction that Bank believes may violate this Agreement. 
If Cardholder provides the Account number to make a purchase or 
obtain an advance without presenting the Card (such as for a mail order 
or telephone purchase), or if Cardholder authorizes someone else to 
make a charge to the Account, Cardholder's obligation to pay will be the 
same as if the Card itself was used. Cash Advances also may be ob-
tained through use of the Card (a) upon execution of a written request of 
Cardholder in a form furnished by any financial institution that is a 
member, alone or in association with others, of Visa, Inc. or (b) upon 
Cardholder's execution of a written separate agreement with Bank for a 
Visa overdraft financial agreement, if offered by Bank. All Credit Pur-
chases and Cash Advances are effected at the option of the retail 
merchant (""Seller"") and/or cash advancing financial institution respec-
tively, and Bank shall not be responsible for refusal by any Seller or 
cash advancing financial institution to honor the Card or any ""Related 
Card,"" as defined in paragraph 2 below. 

2. Obligations on the Account. Cardholder (jointly or severally if more 
than one) promises to pay Bank at the address specified on the periodic 
statement (see paragraph 5 below) for all Credit Purchases and Cash 
Advances, together with any Finance Charge as herein provided, plus 
any other charges permitted by this Agreement, all such payments must 
be in lawful money of the United States of America. Cardholder will pay 
in their equivalent in U.S. dollars all charges in a foreign currency, which 
equivalence will be determined by reference to the amount in U.S. 
dollars. Bank shall have paid in good faith to the person presenting the 
item to Bank. Cardholder shall be liable and agrees to pay Bank for 
Credit Purchases made by, or for Cash Advances extended to, Card-
holder or anyone else using the Card unless the use of such Card is by a 
person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, implied, 
or apparent authority for such use and (b) from which Cardholder rece-
ives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally 
liable, and agrees to pay, for all Credit Purchases and Cash Advances 
obtained through the use of any other Card bearing Cardholder's Ac-
count number that has been issued to another person by reason of such 
person being a member of Cardholder's family, or otherwise issued upon 
Cardholder's request (all such Cards bearing the same Account number 
hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). Subject to any mandato-
ry provisions of applicable law, all payments made by Cardholder will be 
applied to the balances on Cardholder's Account in the manner set forth 
later in this Agreement. 

3. Credit Limit. Bank will inform Cardholder from time to time of the 
maximum amount of debt (""Credit Limit"") that may be outstanding in the 
Account at any time, and Bank, in its sole discretion may adjust the 
Credit Limit from time to time. Cardholder agrees not to use or permit the 
use of the Card in any manner that would cause the outstanding balance 
in the Account ever to exceed the Credit Limit. If Cardholder attempts a 
transaction which results in Cardholder�s total outstanding balance (plus 
authorizations) exceeding Cardholder's Credit Limit, Bank may: (a) 
permit the transaction without raising Cardholder's Credit Limit; (b) 
permit the transaction and treat the amount of the transaction that is 
more than the Credit Limit as immediately due; or (c) refuse to permit the 
transaction. If Bank refuses to permit the transaction, Bank may advise 
the person who attempted the transaction that it has been refused. If 
Bank has previously permitted Cardholder to exceed Cardholder's Credit 
Limit, it does not mean that Bank will permit Cardholder to exceed 
Cardholder's Credit Limit on a subsequent date. Bank may designate 
that only a portion of Cardholder's Credit Limit is available for Cash 
Advances. If Cardholder exceeds that limit, Cardholder will be consi-
dered to have exceeded the Credit Limit for all purposes under this 
Agreement. 

4. Notices. Bank will send periodic statements and any other notices to 
Cardholder at the address shown in Bank's files. If this is a joint Account, 
Bank can send periodic statements and notices to either Cardholder. 
Cardholder promises to inform Bank promptly, in writing, of any changes 
in Cardholder's address. Cardholder authorizes Bank, or anyone acting 
on Bank's behalf, to call or send a text message to any number Card-
holder provides or to any number where Bank may reasonably believe 
Bank can contact cardholder, including calls to mobile, cellular, or 
similar devices, and calls using automatic telephone dialing systems 
and/or pre-recorded messages, or to send an email to any address 
where Bank reasonably believes Bank can contact Cardholder. Calls 
and messages may be made for any lawful purpose, including but not 
limited to: suspected fraud or identity theft; obtaining information; Card-
holder's account transactions or servicing; collecting on Cardholder's 
account; and providing Cardholder information about products and 
services. 

5. Periodic Statement. As of the end of each monthly billing cycle, 
Cardholder will be furnished a periodic statement showing, among other 
things, (a) the amount owed (""Previous Balance"") at the beginning of the 
billing cycle, (b) the amount of all Cash Advances, Credit Purchases and 
Finance Charge posted to the Account during the billing cycle, (c) the 
amount of all payments and credits posted to the Account during the 
billing cycle, and (d) the total amount due (""New Balance"") at the end of 
the billing cycle (which amount is the sum of [a] and [b] less [c]), (e) the 
""Minimum Payment,"" and (f) the ""Payment Due Date."" If Cardholder is 
composed of more than one person, only one periodic statement will be 
provided. 

6. Minimum Payment. Cardholder agrees to pay to Bank, on or prior to 
the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, the sum of (a) 
either (i) the entire New Balance or (ii) at Cardholder's option, an amount 
which shall be at least 2.50% of the New Balance (rounded up to the 
nearest dollar) or $50.00, whichever is greater, and (b) any amount that 
is past due and any amount that is over the Credit Limit. If the New 
Balance is less than $50.00, it shall be paid in full. Cardholder may pay 
more than the Minimum Payment, and may at any time pay the full 
amount owing to Bank. If Cardholder pays more than the Minimum 
Payment, Cardholder must still pay the Minimum Payment as reflected 
on the next periodic statement. The Payment Due Date for a billing cycle 
will be not less than twenty-five (25) days after the preceding billing 
cycle ends (the ""Closing Date""). 

7. Annual Fee: Bank does not charge an annual fee for the Card. 

8. Late Payment Fee. If Bank does not receive a payment from Card-
holder in at least the amount of the Minimum Payment within 30 days 
after the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, Bank may 
charge Cardholder a late payment fee in the amount stated below in the 
Table of Charges. Cardholder will only be charged a late payment fee for 
any Minimum Payment which is not paid within 30 days after the Pay-
ment Due Date. 

9. Cash Advance Fee. Each time Cardholder uses the Card or a Con-
venience Check to obtain a Cash Advance, Bank will assess a cash 
advance fee in the amount stated in the Table of Charges. 

10. When Finance Charge Begins. Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account for all Cash Advances from the later of (a) the day the Cash 
Advance is posted to the Account, or (b) the first day of the billing cycle 
in which the Cash Advance is posted until Cardholder pays the transac-
tion(s) in full. For Credit Purchases, Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account if the Cardholder does not pay the New Balance in full by the 
Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement. If Bank adds a 
Finance Charge, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge on all 
amounts Cardholder owes Bank (except ""New Purchases"") from the first 
day of the billing cycle; provided, however, any portion of the New 
Balance subject to a grace period that is paid prior to the expiration of 
the grace period will not be assessed a Finance Charge. For New 
Purchases, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge from the date 
Bank posts the New Purchase to the Account unless Cardholder has 
paid the New Balance in full on the previous periodic statement. A New 
Purchase is one that appears on the periodic statement for the first time. 

11. Calculation of Finance Charge. Bank calculates the Finance 
Charge on the Account by applying the ""Periodic Rate"" (defined below) 
to the ""Average Daily Balance"" of the Account. To obtain the Average 
Daily Balance, Bank starts with the beginning balance of the Account on 
each day, excluding unpaid Finance Charges. Bank adds any Cash 
Advances posted to the Account that day, and any New Purchases, 
unless Cardholder paid the New Balance in full for the previous billing 
cycle by the Payment Due Date. Bank subtracts any credits and pay-
ments (after any unpaid Finance Charges are paid) posted to the Ac-
count that day. This results in the ""Daily Balance."" Then, Bank adds up 
all the Daily Balances for the billing cycle and divides that by the total 
number of days in the billing cycle. This results in the Average Daily 
Balance. The Finance Charge on the Account is calculated by multiply-
ing the Average Daily Balance by the Periodic Rate for Classic which is 
.008542 and the Periodic Rate for Platinum which is .005208 (but 
subject to change from time to time).

                        payable and Cardholder has been notified of the 
                        APR increase. 

Paying Interest                Cardholder's Payment Due Date is at least 25 
                        days after the close of each billing cycle. Bank 
                        will not charge any interest on purchases if 
                        Cardholder pays the entire balance by the 
                        Payment Due Date each month. Bank will begin 
                        charging interest on Cash Advances on the 
                        transaction date.

*Bank adds 3% to the Prime Rate to determine Platinum APR (Periodic 
Rate currently .005208). 

For Credit Purchases and Cash Advances which occur on a Platinum 
Account, the APR varies with changes to the Prime Rate. The �Prime 
Rate� is the highest prime rate published in the Money Rates column of 
the Wall Street Journal 30 days before the Closing Date on Cardholder�s 
periodic statement (the �Calculation Date�). On May 1, 2010 the Prime 
Rate was 3.25% therefore the APR was 6.25%. A variable APR will go 
up and down depending on the Prime Rate as of each Calculation Date; 
however, a variable rate APR is subject to change only on the first day of 
each billing cycle. If the Prime Rate and the corresponding APR in-
crease, the Finance Charge also will increase and Cardholder�s Mini-
mum Payment may also increase. The Prime Rate is only a pricing 
index and is not the lowest interest rate available. 

12. Other Payment Terms. All payments received on or before (a) 5 
o'clock p.m. (Fort Worth, Texas time) on Bank's business day at the 
address indicated on the periodic statement, or (b) the closing time of 
the applicable branch if payment is made in person, will be credited to 
the Account as of the date of receipt of payment. If payment is made at 
any other location, credit for the payment may be delayed up to 5 days. 
Bank can accept late or partial payments, as well as payments that are 
marked with ""Paid In Full"" or any other similar language without losing or 
waiving any of Bank�s rights or Cardholder's obligations under this 
Agreement. Payment by check constitutes Cardholder's authorization for 
Bank to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from Cardholder's 
bank to make such payment. Bank is not responsible for any lost or 
stolen cash payments. Payments and credits to the Account will be 
applied in the following order: 

. Unpaid Finance Charge; 
. Late Fee; 
. Cash Advance from previous billing cycle; 
. Credit Purchases from previous billing cycle; 
. Cash Advances from current billing cycle; and 
. Credit Purchases from current billing cycle. 


13. Convenience Checks. Bank may issue ""Convenience Checks"" to 
Cardholder that may be used to access the Account. Use of a Conveni-
ence Check will be treated as a Cash Advance in the amount of the 
Check. Each Convenience Check will contain Cardholder's Account 
Number, and may be used only by the person(s) whose name(s) is/are 
printed on it. Each Convenience Check must be completed and signed in 
the same way as a regular personal check. If Bank provides Conveni-


ence Checks for the Account, Cardholder may not use them to pay any 
amount Cardholder owes under this Agreement. Cardholder agrees that 
Bank need not return Convenience Checks to Cardholder after their use, 
and that, if Cardholder needs evidence of any payment represented by 
the Convenience Check, a photocopy or similar reproduction will be 
satisfactory for such purposes. If Cardholder wishes to prevent payment 
of a Convenience Check, the instructions which Bank provides when the 
Convenience Checks are issued must be followed. In the event payment 
of a Convenience Check has been stopped, Cardholder agrees to hold 
Bank harmless and indemnify Bank for any losses, expenses and costs, 
including attorney's fees incurred by Bank, for preventing payment of 
any Convenience Check. Bank will use its best efforts to stop payment, 
but will incur no liability to Cardholder if it is unable to stop payment on a 
Convenience Check. 

14. Termination. Bank may terminate Cardholder's privileges under this 
Agreement or limit Cardholder's right to make Credit Purchases or 
receive Cash Advances at any time (and list Cardholder's Account in 
warning bulletins in the event of such termination) without any reason or 
without advance notice or resulting liability. If Bank requests, Cardholder 
must return the Card and Convenience Checks to Bank. Cardholder 
agrees that Cardholder will not try to make a Credit Purchase or obtain a 
Cash Advance after Cardholder has been notified that Cardholder's 
privilege to use the Account has been terminated. Cardholder may 
terminate this Agreement at any time. If Cardholder does terminate, all 
Cards and Convenience Checks previously issued on the Account must 
be returned to Bank. If Cardholder telephones Bank with the termination 
request, Bank may require that Cardholder confirm such intent to termi-
nate in writing. Bank's or Cardholder's termination will not affect Card-
holder's existing obligations under this Agreement or Cardholder's 
liability for all charges posted to Cardholder's Account prior to the time 
all Cards and Convenience Checks are returned to Bank. When the 
Account is closed, Cardholder must contact everyone authorized to 
charge transactions to the Account, such as internet service providers, 
health clubs or insurance companies. These transactions may continue 
to be charged to the Account until Cardholder changes the billing. Also, if 
the Bank believes Cardholder has authorized a transaction or is attempt-
ing to use Cardholder�s Account after Cardholder has requested to close 
the Account, Bank may allow the transaction to be charged to the 
Account. If the Account is terminated by Cardholder or by Bank for 
reasons other than Cardholder's default, Cardholder will be required to 
pay the outstanding balance on the Account according to the terms of 
this Agreement immediately prior to such termination. 

15. Default. If (a) Cardholder defaults in any payment required to be 
made on the Account or otherwise violates any provision of this Agree-
ment, or (b) Cardholder dies or seeks to obtain any relief as a debtor in 
any proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor relief law, or 
(c) Cardholder provides Bank with false or misleading information or 
signatures at any time, or (d) Cardholder fails to make any payment or 
perform any promise in any other agreement or obligation that Card-
holder owes Bank, then Cardholder will be in default under this Agree-
ment. Bank, upon such default, may at its election (a) decline to extend 
further credit under this Agreement (and Cardholder agrees not to make 
further Credit Purchases or to obtain further Cash Advances) and (b) 
declare all amounts then owed to Bank by Cardholder immediately due 
and payable, without prior notice or demand of any kind, except as may 
be required by applicable law. After Bank declares all amounts then 
owed to Bank by Cardholder to be due and payable, and terminates 
Cardholder�s credit privileges under the Account Bank, at its option (but 
only after providing to Cardholder notice if such is required by applicable 
law), may increase the Annual Percentage Rate up to 18%, which is the 
Default Rate under the Table of Charges. 

16. Collection Charges. If Cardholder defaults, to the extent permitted 
by applicable law, Cardholder agrees to pay (a) all amounts actually 
incurred by Bank as court costs and attorneys' fees set by a court in 
connection with the collection of amounts due by Cardholder under the 
Account and (b) premiums or other identifiable charges received in 
connection with the permitted sale of insurance. In addition, Bank may 
impose on Cardholder a processing fee of $20.00 if a check provided to 
Bank by Cardholder is dishonored for any reason. The dishonored check 
processing fee may be added to the New Balance and is payable on the 
next following due date, however, such fee will not accrue any Finance 
Charge. 

17. Governing Law. This Agreement is performable in Texas and is 
made pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance 
Code, as amended. THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, AND EN-
FORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL MATTERS ARISING 
OUT OF THE ISSUANCE AND USE OF THE CARD SHALL BE GO-
VERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND, TO THE 
EXTENT APPLICABLE, THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. 

18. Amendment. The terms of this Agreement including, but not limited 
to, the rate or index, formula or provision of law used to compute the 
ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are subject to revision as to current and 
future balances, from time to time, by written notice from Bank to Card-
holder as provided by applicable law. 

19. Telephone Conversations. Cardholder agrees that Bank, its 
agents, or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone 
communications with Cardholder. 

20. Liability for Unauthorized Use. Cardholder may be liable for 
unauthorized use of the Account. If the Card is lost or stolen, or if Card-
holder believes someone is using the Account without proper authority, 
Cardholder must notify Bank immediately by calling 1-800-325-3678. 
Cardholder will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after 
Cardholder notifies Bank of the loss or theft of the Card or Convenience 
Check, or the possible unauthorized use of the Account. Bank may 
terminate or limit access to the Account if Cardholder has notified Bank, 
or if Bank has determined that the Card or Convenience Check may 
have been lost or stolen, or that there may be unauthorized access to 
the Account. Cardholder agrees to provide Bank with complete coopera-
tion in Bank's efforts to recover any stolen Card or Convenience Check 
and amounts due from unauthorized users, and in prosecuting unautho-
rized users. 

21. Bank�s Liability for Failing to Make Transfers. If Bank does not 
complete a transaction to or from the Account on time or in the correct 
amount according to this Agreement, Bank may be liable for Cardhold-
er's losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. Bank will 
not be liable, for instance: (a) if, through no fault of Bank's, the available 
credit is insufficient for the transaction or is unavailable for withdrawal 
(for example, because funds have not been finally collected or are 
subject to legal process); (b) if a computer system, ATM, or point of sale 
terminal did not have enough cash or was not working properly and 
Cardholder knew about the problem when Cardholder started the trans-
action; (c) if Cardholder attempts to use the Account or the Card which 
has not been properly activated; (d) if the Card has been reported as lost 
or stolen, has been suspended by Bank or Bank has reason to believe 
the transaction is not authorized by Cardholder, or if Cardholder is trying 
to defraud Bank; or (e) as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

22. Assignment of Account. Cardholder agrees that Bank may at any 
time assign and transfer Cardholder's Account, this Agreement, and 
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, without Cardholder's 
consent or notice to Cardholder. The person to whom the Account and 
Agreement is assigned shall be entitled to all of Bank's rights under this 
Agreement. 

23. Information Sharing. Cardholder authorizes Bank to share informa-
tion concerning Cardholder and Cardholder�s Account with companies 
related to Bank by common ownership. Cardholder authorizes Bank to 
share information with companies in which Bank has an ownership 
interest, concerning purchases made by Cardholder using Cardholder�s 
Account, for the purpose of obtaining special merchandise offers or 
discounts for Cardholder. Cardholder does not authorize Bank to dis-
close Cardholder�s name, address, telephone number or other personal 
information to these companies. 

24. Credit Reporting Agencies. Bank may give information about 
Cardholder's payment history under this Agreement to other persons or 
companies when permitted by law. Cardholder authorizes Bank to make 
whatever credit or investigative inquiries Bank deems necessary in the 
course of review of any credit extended under this Agreement. A nega-
tive credit report which may affect Cardholder's credit record may be 
submitted to a credit reporting agency if Cardholder fails to keep Card-
holder's promises under this Agreement. 

25. Delay of Rights. Bank can waive or delay enforcement of any of its 
rights under this Agreement without losing them. 

26. Separable Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to 
be invalid or enforceable, the rest of this Agreement will not be affected. 
Cardholder will not be held liable for Finance Charges or other fees and 
charges greater than the maximum allowed by law that applies.

currency conversion rate to be used is either (a) a wholesale market rate 
or (b) a government-mandated rate in effect one (1) day prior to the 
processing date, increased by one percent (1%) in each case. Visa

creditcardagreement_1368.TXT,"First Command Bank Visa Cardholder Agreement (Platinum/Classic)

The person(s) (""Cardholder,"" whether one or more) who signed and 
returned the Application for a Visa (""Application"") has requested First 
Command Bank (""Bank"") to extend to Cardholder open-end credit. The 
term ""Cardholder"" means each person who signed and returned the 
Application and any other person who has agreed to be responsible for 
the Account (defined below). As used in this Agreement, the term 
�person� means an individual or an entity, as applicable. By Cardholder's 
use of the credit card (""Card""), furnished by Bank in reliance in part upon 
the information supplied by Cardholder in the Application, Cardholder 
agrees with Bank as follows: 

1. Using the Account. Cardholder has accepted the revolving tri-party 
account (""Account"") made available to Cardholder by Bank. Cardholder 
may use the Card to purchase or lease goods or services, or pay 
amounts that Cardholder owes, wherever the Card is honored (""Credit 
Purchases""). Cardholder may also use the Card to obtain cash loans 
(""Cash Advances"") from any financial institution that accepts the Card. 
Cardholder agrees that the Account will not be used to access gambling 
web sites or to purchase illegal goods or services. Bank may refuse to 
process any transaction that Bank believes may violate this Agreement. 
If Cardholder provides the Account number to make a purchase or 
obtain an advance without presenting the Card (such as for a mail order 
or telephone purchase), or if Cardholder authorizes someone else to 
make a charge to the Account, Cardholder's obligation to pay will be the 
same as if the Card itself was used. Cash Advances also may be ob-
tained through use of the Card (a) upon execution of a written request of 
Cardholder in a form furnished by any financial institution that is a 
member, alone or in association with others, of Visa, Inc. or (b) upon 
Cardholder's execution of a written separate agreement with Bank for a 
Visa overdraft financial agreement, if offered by Bank. All Credit Pur-
chases and Cash Advances are effected at the option of the retail 
merchant (""Seller"") and/or cash advancing financial institution respec-
tively, and Bank shall not be responsible for refusal by any Seller or 
cash advancing financial institution to honor the Card or any ""Related 
Card,"" as defined in paragraph 2 below. 

2. Obligations on the Account. Cardholder (jointly or severally if more 
than one) promises to pay Bank at the address specified on the periodic 
statement (see paragraph 5 below) for all Credit Purchases and Cash 
Advances, together with any Finance Charge as herein provided, plus 
any other charges permitted by this Agreement, all such payments must 
be in lawful money of the United States of America. Cardholder will pay 
in their equivalent in U.S. dollars all charges in a foreign currency, which 
equivalence will be determined by reference to the amount in U.S. 
dollars. Bank shall have paid in good faith to the person presenting the 
item to Bank. Cardholder shall be liable and agrees to pay Bank for 
Credit Purchases made by, or for Cash Advances extended to, Card-
holder or anyone else using the Card unless the use of such Card is by a 
person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, implied, 
or apparent authority for such use and (b) from which Cardholder rece-
ives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally 
liable, and agrees to pay, for all Credit Purchases and Cash Advances 
obtained through the use of any other Card bearing Cardholder's Ac-
count number that has been issued to another person by reason of such 
person being a member of Cardholder's family, or otherwise issued upon 
Cardholder's request (all such Cards bearing the same Account number 
hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). Subject to any mandato-
ry provisions of applicable law, all payments made by Cardholder will be 
applied to the balances on Cardholder's Account in the manner set forth 
later in this Agreement. 

3. Credit Limit. Bank will inform Cardholder from time to time of the 
maximum amount of debt (""Credit Limit"") that may be outstanding in the 
Account at any time, and Bank, in its sole discretion may adjust the 
Credit Limit from time to time. Cardholder agrees not to use or permit the 
use of the Card in any manner that would cause the outstanding balance 
in the Account ever to exceed the Credit Limit. If Cardholder attempts a 
transaction which results in Cardholder�s total outstanding balance (plus 
authorizations) exceeding Cardholder's Credit Limit, Bank may: (a) 
permit the transaction without raising Cardholder's Credit Limit; (b) 
permit the transaction and treat the amount of the transaction that is 
more than the Credit Limit as immediately due; or (c) refuse to permit the 
transaction. If Bank refuses to permit the transaction, Bank may advise 
the person who attempted the transaction that it has been refused. If 
Bank has previously permitted Cardholder to exceed Cardholder's Credit 
Limit, it does not mean that Bank will permit Cardholder to exceed 
Cardholder's Credit Limit on a subsequent date. Bank may designate 
that only a portion of Cardholder's Credit Limit is available for Cash 
Advances. If Cardholder exceeds that limit, Cardholder will be consi-
dered to have exceeded the Credit Limit for all purposes under this 
Agreement. 

4. Notices. Bank will send periodic statements and any other notices to 
Cardholder at the address shown in Bank's files. If this is a joint Account, 
Bank can send periodic statements and notices to either Cardholder. 
Cardholder promises to inform Bank promptly, in writing, of any changes 
in Cardholder's address. Cardholder authorizes Bank, or anyone acting 
on Bank's behalf, to call or send a text message to any number Card-
holder provides or to any number where Bank may reasonably believe 
Bank can contact cardholder, including calls to mobile, cellular, or 
similar devices, and calls using automatic telephone dialing systems 
and/or pre-recorded messages, or to send an email to any address 
where Bank reasonably believes Bank can contact Cardholder. Calls 
and messages may be made for any lawful purpose, including but not 
limited to: suspected fraud or identity theft; obtaining information; Card-
holder's account transactions or servicing; collecting on Cardholder's 
account; and providing Cardholder information about products and 
services. 

5. Periodic Statement. As of the end of each monthly billing cycle, 
Cardholder will be furnished a periodic statement showing, among other 
things, (a) the amount owed (""Previous Balance"") at the beginning of the 
billing cycle, (b) the amount of all Cash Advances, Credit Purchases and 
Finance Charge posted to the Account during the billing cycle, (c) the 
amount of all payments and credits posted to the Account during the 
billing cycle, and (d) the total amount due (""New Balance"") at the end of 
the billing cycle (which amount is the sum of [a] and [b] less [c]), (e) the 
""Minimum Payment,"" and (f) the ""Payment Due Date."" If Cardholder is 
composed of more than one person, only one periodic statement will be 
provided. 

6. Minimum Payment. Cardholder agrees to pay to Bank, on or prior to 
the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, the sum of (a) 
either (i) the entire New Balance or (ii) at Cardholder's option, an amount 
which shall be at least 2.50% of the New Balance (rounded up to the 
nearest dollar) or $50.00, whichever is greater, and (b) any amount that 
is past due and any amount that is over the Credit Limit. If the New 
Balance is less than $50.00, it shall be paid in full. Cardholder may pay 
more than the Minimum Payment, and may at any time pay the full 
amount owing to Bank. If Cardholder pays more than the Minimum 
Payment, Cardholder must still pay the Minimum Payment as reflected 
on the next periodic statement. The Payment Due Date for a billing cycle 
will be not less than twenty-five (25) days after the preceding billing 
cycle ends (the ""Closing Date""). 

7. Annual Fee: Bank does not charge an annual fee for the Card. 

8. Late Payment Fee. If Bank does not receive a payment from Card-
holder in at least the amount of the Minimum Payment within 30 days 
after the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, Bank may 
charge Cardholder a late payment fee in the amount stated below in the 
Table of Charges. Cardholder will only be charged a late payment fee for 
any Minimum Payment which is not paid within 30 days after the Pay-
ment Due Date. 

9. Cash Advance Fee. Each time Cardholder uses the Card or a Con-
venience Check to obtain a Cash Advance, Bank will assess a cash 
advance fee in the amount stated in the Table of Charges. 

10. When Finance Charge Begins. Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account for all Cash Advances from the later of (a) the day the Cash 
Advance is posted to the Account, or (b) the first day of the billing cycle 
in which the Cash Advance is posted until Cardholder pays the transac-
tion(s) in full. For Credit Purchases, Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account if the Cardholder does not pay the New Balance in full by the 
Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement. If Bank adds a 
Finance Charge, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge on all 
amounts Cardholder owes Bank (except ""New Purchases"") from the first 
day of the billing cycle; provided, however, any portion of the New 
Balance subject to a grace period that is paid prior to the expiration of 
the grace period will not be assessed a Finance Charge. For New 
Purchases, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge from the date 
Bank posts the New Purchase to the Account unless Cardholder has 
paid the New Balance in full on the previous periodic statement. A New 
Purchase is one that appears on the periodic statement for the first time. 

11. Calculation of Finance Charge. Bank calculates the Finance 
Charge on the Account by applying the ""Periodic Rate"" (defined below) 
to the ""Average Daily Balance"" of the Account. To obtain the Average 
Daily Balance, Bank starts with the beginning balance of the Account on 
each day, excluding unpaid Finance Charges. Bank adds any Cash 
Advances posted to the Account that day, and any New Purchases, 
unless Cardholder paid the New Balance in full for the previous billing 
cycle by the Payment Due Date. Bank subtracts any credits and pay-
ments (after any unpaid Finance Charges are paid) posted to the Ac-
count that day. This results in the ""Daily Balance."" Then, Bank adds up 
all the Daily Balances for the billing cycle and divides that by the total 
number of days in the billing cycle. This results in the Average Daily 
Balance. The Finance Charge on the Account is calculated by multiply-
ing the Average Daily Balance by the Periodic Rate for Classic which is 
.008542 and the Periodic Rate for Platinum which is .005208 (but 
subject to change from time to time).

                        APR increase. 

Paying Interest                Cardholder's Payment Due Date is at least 25 
                        days after the close of each billing cycle. Bank 
                        will not charge any interest on purchases if 
                        Cardholder pays the entire balance by the 
                        Payment Due Date each month. Bank will begin 
                        charging interest on Cash Advances on the 
                        transaction date.

*Bank adds 3% to the Prime Rate to determine Platinum APR (Periodic 
Rate currently .005208). 

For Credit Purchases and Cash Advances which occur on a Platinum 
Account, the APR varies with changes to the Prime Rate. The �Prime 
Rate� is the highest prime rate published in the Money Rates column of 
the Wall Street Journal 30 days before the Closing Date on Cardholder�s 
periodic statement (the �Calculation Date�). On May 1, 2010 the Prime 
Rate was 3.25% therefore the APR was 6.25%. A variable APR will go 
up and down depending on the Prime Rate as of each Calculation Date; 
however, a variable rate APR is subject to change only on the first day of 
each billing cycle. If the Prime Rate and the corresponding APR in-
crease, the Finance Charge also will increase and Cardholder�s Mini-
mum Payment may also increase. The Prime Rate is only a pricing 
index and is not the lowest interest rate available. 

12. Other Payment Terms. All payments received on or before (a) 5 
o'clock p.m. (Fort Worth, Texas time) on Bank's business day at the 
address indicated on the periodic statement, or (b) the closing time of 
the applicable branch if payment is made in person, will be credited to 
the Account as of the date of receipt of payment. If payment is made at 
any other location, credit for the payment may be delayed up to 5 days. 
Bank can accept late or partial payments, as well as payments that are 
marked with ""Paid In Full"" or any other similar language without losing or 
waiving any of Bank�s rights or Cardholder's obligations under this 
Agreement. Payment by check constitutes Cardholder's authorization for 
Bank to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from Cardholder's 
bank to make such payment. Bank is not responsible for any lost or 
stolen cash payments. Payments and credits to the Account will be 
applied in the following order: 

. Unpaid Finance Charge; 
. Late Fee; 
. Cash Advance from previous billing cycle; 
. Credit Purchases from previous billing cycle; 
. Cash Advances from current billing cycle; and 
. Credit Purchases from current billing cycle. 


13. Convenience Checks. Bank may issue ""Convenience Checks"" to 
Cardholder that may be used to access the Account. Use of a Conveni-
ence Check will be treated as a Cash Advance in the amount of the 
Check. Each Convenience Check will contain Cardholder's Account 
Number, and may be used only by the person(s) whose name(s) is/are 
printed on it. Each Convenience Check must be completed and signed in 
the same way as a regular personal check. If Bank provides Conveni-


ence Checks for the Account, Cardholder may not use them to pay any 
amount Cardholder owes under this Agreement. Cardholder agrees that 
Bank need not return Convenience Checks to Cardholder after their use, 
and that, if Cardholder needs evidence of any payment represented by 
the Convenience Check, a photocopy or similar reproduction will be 
satisfactory for such purposes. If Cardholder wishes to prevent payment 
of a Convenience Check, the instructions which Bank provides when the 
Convenience Checks are issued must be followed. In the event payment 
of a Convenience Check has been stopped, Cardholder agrees to hold 
Bank harmless and indemnify Bank for any losses, expenses and costs, 
including attorney's fees incurred by Bank, for preventing payment of 
any Convenience Check. Bank will use its best efforts to stop payment, 
but will incur no liability to Cardholder if it is unable to stop payment on a 
Convenience Check. 

14. Termination. Bank may terminate Cardholder's privileges under this 
Agreement or limit Cardholder's right to make Credit Purchases or 
receive Cash Advances at any time (and list Cardholder's Account in 
warning bulletins in the event of such termination) without any reason or 
without advance notice or resulting liability. If Bank requests, Cardholder 
must return the Card and Convenience Checks to Bank. Cardholder 
agrees that Cardholder will not try to make a Credit Purchase or obtain a 
Cash Advance after Cardholder has been notified that Cardholder's 
privilege to use the Account has been terminated. Cardholder may 
terminate this Agreement at any time. If Cardholder does terminate, all 
Cards and Convenience Checks previously issued on the Account must 
be returned to Bank. If Cardholder telephones Bank with the termination 
request, Bank may require that Cardholder confirm such intent to termi-
nate in writing. Bank's or Cardholder's termination will not affect Card-
holder's existing obligations under this Agreement or Cardholder's 
liability for all charges posted to Cardholder's Account prior to the time 
all Cards and Convenience Checks are returned to Bank. When the 
Account is closed, Cardholder must contact everyone authorized to 
charge transactions to the Account, such as internet service providers, 
health clubs or insurance companies. These transactions may continue 
to be charged to the Account until Cardholder changes the billing. Also, if 
the Bank believes Cardholder has authorized a transaction or is attempt-
ing to use Cardholder�s Account after Cardholder has requested to close 
the Account, Bank may allow the transaction to be charged to the 
Account. If the Account is terminated by Cardholder or by Bank for 
reasons other than Cardholder's default, Cardholder will be required to 
pay the outstanding balance on the Account according to the terms of 
this Agreement immediately prior to such termination. 

15. Default. If (a) Cardholder defaults in any payment required to be 
made on the Account or otherwise violates any provision of this Agree-
ment, or (b) Cardholder dies or seeks to obtain any relief as a debtor in 
any proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor relief law, or 
(c) Cardholder provides Bank with false or misleading information or 
signatures at any time, or (d) Cardholder fails to make any payment or 
perform any promise in any other agreement or obligation that Card-
holder owes Bank, then Cardholder will be in default under this Agree-
ment. Bank, upon such default, may at its election (a) decline to extend 
further credit under this Agreement (and Cardholder agrees not to make 
further Credit Purchases or to obtain further Cash Advances) and (b) 
declare all amounts then owed to Bank by Cardholder immediately due 
and payable, without prior notice or demand of any kind, except as may 
be required by applicable law. After Bank declares all amounts then 
owed to Bank by Cardholder to be due and payable, and terminates 
Cardholder�s credit privileges under the Account Bank, at its option (but 
only after providing to Cardholder notice if such is required by applicable 
law), may increase the Annual Percentage Rate up to 18%, which is the 
Default Rate under the Table of Charges. 

16. Collection Charges. If Cardholder defaults, to the extent permitted

transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be converted by 
Visa into a U.S. dollar amount in accordance with the operating regula-
tions or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is 
processed. Currently, those regulations and procedures provide that the 
currency conversion rate to be used is either (a) a wholesale market rate 
or (b) a government-mandated rate in effect one (1) day prior to the 
processing date, increased by one percent (1%) in each case. Visa 
retains this one percent as compensation for performing the currency 
conversion service. The currency conversion rate in effect on the 
processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date 
or the posting date.

ments of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify, and record information

creditcardagreement_1368.TXT,"First Command Bank Visa Cardholder Agreement (Platinum/Classic)

The person(s) (""Cardholder,"" whether one or more) who signed and 
returned the Application for a Visa (""Application"") has requested First 
Command Bank (""Bank"") to extend to Cardholder open-end credit. The 
term ""Cardholder"" means each person who signed and returned the 
Application and any other person who has agreed to be responsible for 
the Account (defined below). As used in this Agreement, the term 
�person� means an individual or an entity, as applicable. By Cardholder's 
use of the credit card (""Card""), furnished by Bank in reliance in part upon 
the information supplied by Cardholder in the Application, Cardholder 
agrees with Bank as follows: 

1. Using the Account. Cardholder has accepted the revolving tri-party 
account (""Account"") made available to Cardholder by Bank. Cardholder 
may use the Card to purchase or lease goods or services, or pay 
amounts that Cardholder owes, wherever the Card is honored (""Credit 
Purchases""). Cardholder may also use the Card to obtain cash loans 
(""Cash Advances"") from any financial institution that accepts the Card. 
Cardholder agrees that the Account will not be used to access gambling 
web sites or to purchase illegal goods or services. Bank may refuse to 
process any transaction that Bank believes may violate this Agreement. 
If Cardholder provides the Account number to make a purchase or 
obtain an advance without presenting the Card (such as for a mail order 
or telephone purchase), or if Cardholder authorizes someone else to 
make a charge to the Account, Cardholder's obligation to pay will be the 
same as if the Card itself was used. Cash Advances also may be ob-
tained through use of the Card (a) upon execution of a written request of 
Cardholder in a form furnished by any financial institution that is a 
member, alone or in association with others, of Visa, Inc. or (b) upon 
Cardholder's execution of a written separate agreement with Bank for a 
Visa overdraft financial agreement, if offered by Bank. All Credit Pur-
chases and Cash Advances are effected at the option of the retail 
merchant (""Seller"") and/or cash advancing financial institution respec-
tively, and Bank shall not be responsible for refusal by any Seller or 
cash advancing financial institution to honor the Card or any ""Related 
Card,"" as defined in paragraph 2 below. 

2. Obligations on the Account. Cardholder (jointly or severally if more 
than one) promises to pay Bank at the address specified on the periodic 
statement (see paragraph 5 below) for all Credit Purchases and Cash 
Advances, together with any Finance Charge as herein provided, plus 
any other charges permitted by this Agreement, all such payments must 
be in lawful money of the United States of America. Cardholder will pay 
in their equivalent in U.S. dollars all charges in a foreign currency, which 
equivalence will be determined by reference to the amount in U.S. 
dollars. Bank shall have paid in good faith to the person presenting the 
item to Bank. Cardholder shall be liable and agrees to pay Bank for 
Credit Purchases made by, or for Cash Advances extended to, Card-
holder or anyone else using the Card unless the use of such Card is by a 
person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, implied, 
or apparent authority for such use and (b) from which Cardholder rece-
ives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally 
liable, and agrees to pay, for all Credit Purchases and Cash Advances 
obtained through the use of any other Card bearing Cardholder's Ac-
count number that has been issued to another person by reason of such 
person being a member of Cardholder's family, or otherwise issued upon 
Cardholder's request (all such Cards bearing the same Account number 
hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). Subject to any mandato-
ry provisions of applicable law, all payments made by Cardholder will be 
applied to the balances on Cardholder's Account in the manner set forth 
later in this Agreement. 

3. Credit Limit. Bank will inform Cardholder from time to time of the 
maximum amount of debt (""Credit Limit"") that may be outstanding in the 
Account at any time, and Bank, in its sole discretion may adjust the 
Credit Limit from time to time. Cardholder agrees not to use or permit the 
use of the Card in any manner that would cause the outstanding balance 
in the Account ever to exceed the Credit Limit. If Cardholder attempts a 
transaction which results in Cardholder�s total outstanding balance (plus 
authorizations) exceeding Cardholder's Credit Limit, Bank may: (a) 
permit the transaction without raising Cardholder's Credit Limit; (b) 
permit the transaction and treat the amount of the transaction that is 
more than the Credit Limit as immediately due; or (c) refuse to permit the 
transaction. If Bank refuses to permit the transaction, Bank may advise 
the person who attempted the transaction that it has been refused. If 
Bank has previously permitted Cardholder to exceed Cardholder's Credit 
Limit, it does not mean that Bank will permit Cardholder to exceed 
Cardholder's Credit Limit on a subsequent date. Bank may designate 
that only a portion of Cardholder's Credit Limit is available for Cash 
Advances. If Cardholder exceeds that limit, Cardholder will be consi-
dered to have exceeded the Credit Limit for all purposes under this 
Agreement. 

4. Notices. Bank will send periodic statements and any other notices to 
Cardholder at the address shown in Bank's files. If this is a joint Account, 
Bank can send periodic statements and notices to either Cardholder. 
Cardholder promises to inform Bank promptly, in writing, of any changes 
in Cardholder's address. Cardholder authorizes Bank, or anyone acting 
on Bank's behalf, to call or send a text message to any number Card-
holder provides or to any number where Bank may reasonably believe 
Bank can contact cardholder, including calls to mobile, cellular, or 
similar devices, and calls using automatic telephone dialing systems 
and/or pre-recorded messages, or to send an email to any address 
where Bank reasonably believes Bank can contact Cardholder. Calls 
and messages may be made for any lawful purpose, including but not 
limited to: suspected fraud or identity theft; obtaining information; Card-
holder's account transactions or servicing; collecting on Cardholder's 
account; and providing Cardholder information about products and 
services. 

5. Periodic Statement. As of the end of each monthly billing cycle, 
Cardholder will be furnished a periodic statement showing, among other 
things, (a) the amount owed (""Previous Balance"") at the beginning of the 
billing cycle, (b) the amount of all Cash Advances, Credit Purchases and 
Finance Charge posted to the Account during the billing cycle, (c) the 
amount of all payments and credits posted to the Account during the 
billing cycle, and (d) the total amount due (""New Balance"") at the end of 
the billing cycle (which amount is the sum of [a] and [b] less [c]), (e) the 
""Minimum Payment,"" and (f) the ""Payment Due Date."" If Cardholder is 
composed of more than one person, only one periodic statement will be 
provided. 

6. Minimum Payment. Cardholder agrees to pay to Bank, on or prior to 
the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, the sum of (a) 
either (i) the entire New Balance or (ii) at Cardholder's option, an amount 
which shall be at least 2.50% of the New Balance (rounded up to the 
nearest dollar) or $50.00, whichever is greater, and (b) any amount that 
is past due and any amount that is over the Credit Limit. If the New 
Balance is less than $50.00, it shall be paid in full. Cardholder may pay 
more than the Minimum Payment, and may at any time pay the full 
amount owing to Bank. If Cardholder pays more than the Minimum 
Payment, Cardholder must still pay the Minimum Payment as reflected 
on the next periodic statement. The Payment Due Date for a billing cycle 
will be not less than twenty-five (25) days after the preceding billing 
cycle ends (the ""Closing Date""). 

7. Annual Fee: Bank does not charge an annual fee for the Card. 

8. Late Payment Fee. If Bank does not receive a payment from Card-
holder in at least the amount of the Minimum Payment within 30 days 
after the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, Bank may 
charge Cardholder a late payment fee in the amount stated below in the 
Table of Charges. Cardholder will only be charged a late payment fee for 
any Minimum Payment which is not paid within 30 days after the Pay-
ment Due Date. 

9. Cash Advance Fee. Each time Cardholder uses the Card or a Con-
venience Check to obtain a Cash Advance, Bank will assess a cash 
advance fee in the amount stated in the Table of Charges. 

10. When Finance Charge Begins. Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account for all Cash Advances from the later of (a) the day the Cash 
Advance is posted to the Account, or (b) the first day of the billing cycle 
in which the Cash Advance is posted until Cardholder pays the transac-
tion(s) in full. For Credit Purchases, Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account if the Cardholder does not pay the New Balance in full by the 
Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement. If Bank adds a 
Finance Charge, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge on all 
amounts Cardholder owes Bank (except ""New Purchases"") from the first 
day of the billing cycle; provided, however, any portion of the New 
Balance subject to a grace period that is paid prior to the expiration of 
the grace period will not be assessed a Finance Charge. For New 
Purchases, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge from the date 
Bank posts the New Purchase to the Account unless Cardholder has 
paid the New Balance in full on the previous periodic statement. A New 
Purchase is one that appears on the periodic statement for the first time. 

11. Calculation of Finance Charge. Bank calculates the Finance 
Charge on the Account by applying the ""Periodic Rate"" (defined below) 
to the ""Average Daily Balance"" of the Account. To obtain the Average 
Daily Balance, Bank starts with the beginning balance of the Account on 
each day, excluding unpaid Finance Charges. Bank adds any Cash 
Advances posted to the Account that day, and any New Purchases, 
unless Cardholder paid the New Balance in full for the previous billing 
cycle by the Payment Due Date. Bank subtracts any credits and pay-
ments (after any unpaid Finance Charges are paid) posted to the Ac-
count that day. This results in the ""Daily Balance."" Then, Bank adds up 
all the Daily Balances for the billing cycle and divides that by the total 
number of days in the billing cycle. This results in the Average Daily 
Balance. The Finance Charge on the Account is calculated by multiply-
ing the Average Daily Balance by the Periodic Rate for Classic which is 
.008542 and the Periodic Rate for Platinum which is .005208 (but 
subject to change from time to time).

Paying Interest                Cardholder's Payment Due Date is at least 25 
                        days after the close of each billing cycle. Bank 
                        will not charge any interest on purchases if 
                        Cardholder pays the entire balance by the 
                        Payment Due Date each month. Bank will begin 
                        charging interest on Cash Advances on the 
                        transaction date.

*Bank adds 3% to the Prime Rate to determine Platinum APR (Periodic 
Rate currently .005208). 

For Credit Purchases and Cash Advances which occur on a Platinum 
Account, the APR varies with changes to the Prime Rate. The �Prime 
Rate� is the highest prime rate published in the Money Rates column of 
the Wall Street Journal 30 days before the Closing Date on Cardholder�s 
periodic statement (the �Calculation Date�). On May 1, 2010 the Prime 
Rate was 3.25% therefore the APR was 6.25%. A variable APR will go 
up and down depending on the Prime Rate as of each Calculation Date; 
however, a variable rate APR is subject to change only on the first day of 
each billing cycle. If the Prime Rate and the corresponding APR in-
crease, the Finance Charge also will increase and Cardholder�s Mini-
mum Payment may also increase. The Prime Rate is only a pricing 
index and is not the lowest interest rate available. 

12. Other Payment Terms. All payments received on or before (a) 5 
o'clock p.m. (Fort Worth, Texas time) on Bank's business day at the 
address indicated on the periodic statement, or (b) the closing time of 
the applicable branch if payment is made in person, will be credited to 
the Account as of the date of receipt of payment. If payment is made at 
any other location, credit for the payment may be delayed up to 5 days. 
Bank can accept late or partial payments, as well as payments that are 
marked with ""Paid In Full"" or any other similar language without losing or 
waiving any of Bank�s rights or Cardholder's obligations under this 
Agreement. Payment by check constitutes Cardholder's authorization for 
Bank to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from Cardholder's 
bank to make such payment. Bank is not responsible for any lost or 
stolen cash payments. Payments and credits to the Account will be 
applied in the following order: 

. Unpaid Finance Charge; 
. Late Fee; 
. Cash Advance from previous billing cycle; 
. Credit Purchases from previous billing cycle; 
. Cash Advances from current billing cycle; and 
. Credit Purchases from current billing cycle. 


13. Convenience Checks. Bank may issue ""Convenience Checks"" to 
Cardholder that may be used to access the Account. Use of a Conveni-
ence Check will be treated as a Cash Advance in the amount of the 
Check. Each Convenience Check will contain Cardholder's Account 
Number, and may be used only by the person(s) whose name(s) is/are 
printed on it. Each Convenience Check must be completed and signed in 
the same way as a regular personal check. If Bank provides Conveni-


ence Checks for the Account, Cardholder may not use them to pay any 
amount Cardholder owes under this Agreement. Cardholder agrees that 
Bank need not return Convenience Checks to Cardholder after their use, 
and that, if Cardholder needs evidence of any payment represented by 
the Convenience Check, a photocopy or similar reproduction will be 
satisfactory for such purposes. If Cardholder wishes to prevent payment 
of a Convenience Check, the instructions which Bank provides when the 
Convenience Checks are issued must be followed. In the event payment 
of a Convenience Check has been stopped, Cardholder agrees to hold 
Bank harmless and indemnify Bank for any losses, expenses and costs, 
including attorney's fees incurred by Bank, for preventing payment of 
any Convenience Check. Bank will use its best efforts to stop payment, 
but will incur no liability to Cardholder if it is unable to stop payment on a 
Convenience Check. 

14. Termination. Bank may terminate Cardholder's privileges under this 
Agreement or limit Cardholder's right to make Credit Purchases or 
receive Cash Advances at any time (and list Cardholder's Account in 
warning bulletins in the event of such termination) without any reason or 
without advance notice or resulting liability. If Bank requests, Cardholder 
must return the Card and Convenience Checks to Bank. Cardholder 
agrees that Cardholder will not try to make a Credit Purchase or obtain a 
Cash Advance after Cardholder has been notified that Cardholder's 
privilege to use the Account has been terminated. Cardholder may 
terminate this Agreement at any time. If Cardholder does terminate, all 
Cards and Convenience Checks previously issued on the Account must 
be returned to Bank. If Cardholder telephones Bank with the termination 
request, Bank may require that Cardholder confirm such intent to termi-
nate in writing. Bank's or Cardholder's termination will not affect Card-
holder's existing obligations under this Agreement or Cardholder's 
liability for all charges posted to Cardholder's Account prior to the time 
all Cards and Convenience Checks are returned to Bank. When the 
Account is closed, Cardholder must contact everyone authorized to 
charge transactions to the Account, such as internet service providers, 
health clubs or insurance companies. These transactions may continue 
to be charged to the Account until Cardholder changes the billing. Also, if 
the Bank believes Cardholder has authorized a transaction or is attempt-
ing to use Cardholder�s Account after Cardholder has requested to close 
the Account, Bank may allow the transaction to be charged to the 
Account. If the Account is terminated by Cardholder or by Bank for 
reasons other than Cardholder's default, Cardholder will be required to 
pay the outstanding balance on the Account according to the terms of 
this Agreement immediately prior to such termination. 

15. Default. If (a) Cardholder defaults in any payment required to be 
made on the Account or otherwise violates any provision of this Agree-
ment, or (b) Cardholder dies or seeks to obtain any relief as a debtor in 
any proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor relief law, or 
(c) Cardholder provides Bank with false or misleading information or 
signatures at any time, or (d) Cardholder fails to make any payment or 
perform any promise in any other agreement or obligation that Card-
holder owes Bank, then Cardholder will be in default under this Agree-
ment. Bank, upon such default, may at its election (a) decline to extend 
further credit under this Agreement (and Cardholder agrees not to make 
further Credit Purchases or to obtain further Cash Advances) and (b) 
declare all amounts then owed to Bank by Cardholder immediately due 
and payable, without prior notice or demand of any kind, except as may 
be required by applicable law. After Bank declares all amounts then 
owed to Bank by Cardholder to be due and payable, and terminates 
Cardholder�s credit privileges under the Account Bank, at its option (but 
only after providing to Cardholder notice if such is required by applicable 
law), may increase the Annual Percentage Rate up to 18%, which is the 
Default Rate under the Table of Charges. 

16. Collection Charges. If Cardholder defaults, to the extent permitted 
by applicable law, Cardholder agrees to pay (a) all amounts actually 
incurred by Bank as court costs and attorneys' fees set by a court in 
connection with the collection of amounts due by Cardholder under the 
Account and (b) premiums or other identifiable charges received in 
connection with the permitted sale of insurance. In addition, Bank may 
impose on Cardholder a processing fee of $20.00 if a check provided to 
Bank by Cardholder is dishonored for any reason. The dishonored check 
processing fee may be added to the New Balance and is payable on the 
next following due date, however, such fee will not accrue any Finance 
Charge. 

17. Governing Law. This Agreement is performable in Texas and is 
made pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance 
Code, as amended. THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, AND EN-
FORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL MATTERS ARISING 
OUT OF THE ISSUANCE AND USE OF THE CARD SHALL BE GO-
VERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND, TO THE 
EXTENT APPLICABLE, THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. 

18. Amendment. The terms of this Agreement including, but not limited 
to, the rate or index, formula or provision of law used to compute the

holder as provided by applicable law. 

19. Telephone Conversations. Cardholder agrees that Bank, its 
agents, or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone 
communications with Cardholder. 

20. Liability for Unauthorized Use. Cardholder may be liable for 
unauthorized use of the Account. If the Card is lost or stolen, or if Card-
holder believes someone is using the Account without proper authority, 
Cardholder must notify Bank immediately by calling 1-800-325-3678. 
Cardholder will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after 
Cardholder notifies Bank of the loss or theft of the Card or Convenience 
Check, or the possible unauthorized use of the Account. Bank may 
terminate or limit access to the Account if Cardholder has notified Bank, 
or if Bank has determined that the Card or Convenience Check may 
have been lost or stolen, or that there may be unauthorized access to 
the Account. Cardholder agrees to provide Bank with complete coopera-
tion in Bank's efforts to recover any stolen Card or Convenience Check 
and amounts due from unauthorized users, and in prosecuting unautho-
rized users. 

21. Bank�s Liability for Failing to Make Transfers. If Bank does not 
complete a transaction to or from the Account on time or in the correct 
amount according to this Agreement, Bank may be liable for Cardhold-
er's losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. Bank will 
not be liable, for instance: (a) if, through no fault of Bank's, the available 
credit is insufficient for the transaction or is unavailable for withdrawal 
(for example, because funds have not been finally collected or are 
subject to legal process); (b) if a computer system, ATM, or point of sale 
terminal did not have enough cash or was not working properly and 
Cardholder knew about the problem when Cardholder started the trans-
action; (c) if Cardholder attempts to use the Account or the Card which 
has not been properly activated; (d) if the Card has been reported as lost 
or stolen, has been suspended by Bank or Bank has reason to believe 
the transaction is not authorized by Cardholder, or if Cardholder is trying 
to defraud Bank; or (e) as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

22. Assignment of Account. Cardholder agrees that Bank may at any 
time assign and transfer Cardholder's Account, this Agreement, and 
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, without Cardholder's 
consent or notice to Cardholder. The person to whom the Account and 
Agreement is assigned shall be entitled to all of Bank's rights under this 
Agreement. 

23. Information Sharing. Cardholder authorizes Bank to share informa-
tion concerning Cardholder and Cardholder�s Account with companies 
related to Bank by common ownership. Cardholder authorizes Bank to 
share information with companies in which Bank has an ownership 
interest, concerning purchases made by Cardholder using Cardholder�s 
Account, for the purpose of obtaining special merchandise offers or 
discounts for Cardholder. Cardholder does not authorize Bank to dis-
close Cardholder�s name, address, telephone number or other personal 
information to these companies. 

24. Credit Reporting Agencies. Bank may give information about 
Cardholder's payment history under this Agreement to other persons or 
companies when permitted by law. Cardholder authorizes Bank to make 
whatever credit or investigative inquiries Bank deems necessary in the 
course of review of any credit extended under this Agreement. A nega-
tive credit report which may affect Cardholder's credit record may be 
submitted to a credit reporting agency if Cardholder fails to keep Card-
holder's promises under this Agreement. 

25. Delay of Rights. Bank can waive or delay enforcement of any of its 
rights under this Agreement without losing them. 

26. Separable Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to 
be invalid or enforceable, the rest of this Agreement will not be affected. 
Cardholder will not be held liable for Finance Charges or other fees and 
charges greater than the maximum allowed by law that applies. 

27. Limitation of Responsibility. Bank will not be responsible for 
merchandise or services purchased by Cardholder with the Card or 
Convenience Check unless required by law. Any refund, adjustment or 
credit allowed by a Seller shall not be cash, but rather be by a credit 
advice to Bank which shall be shown as a credit on the periodic state-
ment. Bank will not be responsible for the refusal of any person to honor 
the Card or Convenience Check or if Cardholder is not able to use the 
Card at an ATM. (a) Bank will not be responsible for merchandise or 
services purchased by Cardholder with the Card or Convenience Check 
unless required by law. Any refund, adjustment or credit allowed by a 
Seller shall not be cash, but rather be by a credit advice to Bank which

responsible for the refusal of any person to honor the Card or Conveni-
ence Check or if Cardholder is not able to use the Card at an ATM[; and

TO HONOR THE CARD; THE FAILURE OF MERCHANTS TO PER-
FORM OR PROVIDE SERVICES; COMMUNICATION SYSTEMFAI-
LURES; OR FAILURES OR MALFUNCTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO 
CARDHOLDER'S EQUIPMENT, ANY INTERNET SERVICE, OR ANY 
PAYMENT SYSTEM. IN THE EVENT THAT BANK IS HELD LIABLE 
TO CARDHOLDER, CARDHOLDER WILL ONLY BE ENTITLED TO 
RECOVER CARDHOLDER'S ACTUAL DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT 
SHALL CARDHOLDER BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ANY INDIRECT, 
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (WHETH-
ER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF CARDHOLDER 
HAS ADVISED BANK OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
THIS PROVISION SHALL NOT BE EFFECTIVE TO THE EXTENT 
OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW. 

28. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies. If Cardholder makes a 
transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be converted by 
Visa into a U.S. dollar amount in accordance with the operating regula-
tions or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is 
processed. Currently, those regulations and procedures provide that the 
currency conversion rate to be used is either (a) a wholesale market rate 
or (b) a government-mandated rate in effect one (1) day prior to the 
processing date, increased by one percent (1%) in each case. Visa 
retains this one percent as compensation for performing the currency 
conversion service. The currency conversion rate in effect on the 
processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date 
or the posting date. 

29. USA Patriot Act. Bank is subject to the requirement of the USA 
Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107 56 [signed into law October 26, 2001]) 
(the �Act�) and hereby notifies Cardholder that pursuant to the require-
ments of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify, and record information 
that identifies Cardholder which information includes the name and 
address of Cardholder and other information that will allow such Bank to 
identify Cardholder in accordance with the Act.

ments between Bank and Cardholder governing the use of the Card and

creditcardagreement_1368.TXT,"First Command Bank Visa Cardholder Agreement (Platinum/Classic)

The person(s) (""Cardholder,"" whether one or more) who signed and 
returned the Application for a Visa (""Application"") has requested First 
Command Bank (""Bank"") to extend to Cardholder open-end credit. The 
term ""Cardholder"" means each person who signed and returned the 
Application and any other person who has agreed to be responsible for 
the Account (defined below). As used in this Agreement, the term 
�person� means an individual or an entity, as applicable. By Cardholder's 
use of the credit card (""Card""), furnished by Bank in reliance in part upon 
the information supplied by Cardholder in the Application, Cardholder 
agrees with Bank as follows: 

1. Using the Account. Cardholder has accepted the revolving tri-party 
account (""Account"") made available to Cardholder by Bank. Cardholder 
may use the Card to purchase or lease goods or services, or pay 
amounts that Cardholder owes, wherever the Card is honored (""Credit 
Purchases""). Cardholder may also use the Card to obtain cash loans 
(""Cash Advances"") from any financial institution that accepts the Card. 
Cardholder agrees that the Account will not be used to access gambling 
web sites or to purchase illegal goods or services. Bank may refuse to 
process any transaction that Bank believes may violate this Agreement. 
If Cardholder provides the Account number to make a purchase or 
obtain an advance without presenting the Card (such as for a mail order 
or telephone purchase), or if Cardholder authorizes someone else to 
make a charge to the Account, Cardholder's obligation to pay will be the 
same as if the Card itself was used. Cash Advances also may be ob-
tained through use of the Card (a) upon execution of a written request of 
Cardholder in a form furnished by any financial institution that is a 
member, alone or in association with others, of Visa, Inc. or (b) upon 
Cardholder's execution of a written separate agreement with Bank for a 
Visa overdraft financial agreement, if offered by Bank. All Credit Pur-
chases and Cash Advances are effected at the option of the retail 
merchant (""Seller"") and/or cash advancing financial institution respec-
tively, and Bank shall not be responsible for refusal by any Seller or 
cash advancing financial institution to honor the Card or any ""Related 
Card,"" as defined in paragraph 2 below. 

2. Obligations on the Account. Cardholder (jointly or severally if more 
than one) promises to pay Bank at the address specified on the periodic 
statement (see paragraph 5 below) for all Credit Purchases and Cash 
Advances, together with any Finance Charge as herein provided, plus 
any other charges permitted by this Agreement, all such payments must 
be in lawful money of the United States of America. Cardholder will pay 
in their equivalent in U.S. dollars all charges in a foreign currency, which 
equivalence will be determined by reference to the amount in U.S. 
dollars. Bank shall have paid in good faith to the person presenting the 
item to Bank. Cardholder shall be liable and agrees to pay Bank for 
Credit Purchases made by, or for Cash Advances extended to, Card-
holder or anyone else using the Card unless the use of such Card is by a 
person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, implied, 
or apparent authority for such use and (b) from which Cardholder rece-
ives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally 
liable, and agrees to pay, for all Credit Purchases and Cash Advances 
obtained through the use of any other Card bearing Cardholder's Ac-
count number that has been issued to another person by reason of such 
person being a member of Cardholder's family, or otherwise issued upon 
Cardholder's request (all such Cards bearing the same Account number 
hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). Subject to any mandato-
ry provisions of applicable law, all payments made by Cardholder will be 
applied to the balances on Cardholder's Account in the manner set forth 
later in this Agreement. 

3. Credit Limit. Bank will inform Cardholder from time to time of the 
maximum amount of debt (""Credit Limit"") that may be outstanding in the 
Account at any time, and Bank, in its sole discretion may adjust the 
Credit Limit from time to time. Cardholder agrees not to use or permit the 
use of the Card in any manner that would cause the outstanding balance 
in the Account ever to exceed the Credit Limit. If Cardholder attempts a 
transaction which results in Cardholder�s total outstanding balance (plus 
authorizations) exceeding Cardholder's Credit Limit, Bank may: (a) 
permit the transaction without raising Cardholder's Credit Limit; (b) 
permit the transaction and treat the amount of the transaction that is 
more than the Credit Limit as immediately due; or (c) refuse to permit the 
transaction. If Bank refuses to permit the transaction, Bank may advise 
the person who attempted the transaction that it has been refused. If 
Bank has previously permitted Cardholder to exceed Cardholder's Credit 
Limit, it does not mean that Bank will permit Cardholder to exceed 
Cardholder's Credit Limit on a subsequent date. Bank may designate 
that only a portion of Cardholder's Credit Limit is available for Cash 
Advances. If Cardholder exceeds that limit, Cardholder will be consi-
dered to have exceeded the Credit Limit for all purposes under this 
Agreement. 

4. Notices. Bank will send periodic statements and any other notices to 
Cardholder at the address shown in Bank's files. If this is a joint Account, 
Bank can send periodic statements and notices to either Cardholder. 
Cardholder promises to inform Bank promptly, in writing, of any changes 
in Cardholder's address. Cardholder authorizes Bank, or anyone acting 
on Bank's behalf, to call or send a text message to any number Card-
holder provides or to any number where Bank may reasonably believe 
Bank can contact cardholder, including calls to mobile, cellular, or 
similar devices, and calls using automatic telephone dialing systems 
and/or pre-recorded messages, or to send an email to any address 
where Bank reasonably believes Bank can contact Cardholder. Calls 
and messages may be made for any lawful purpose, including but not 
limited to: suspected fraud or identity theft; obtaining information; Card-
holder's account transactions or servicing; collecting on Cardholder's 
account; and providing Cardholder information about products and 
services. 

5. Periodic Statement. As of the end of each monthly billing cycle, 
Cardholder will be furnished a periodic statement showing, among other 
things, (a) the amount owed (""Previous Balance"") at the beginning of the 
billing cycle, (b) the amount of all Cash Advances, Credit Purchases and 
Finance Charge posted to the Account during the billing cycle, (c) the 
amount of all payments and credits posted to the Account during the 
billing cycle, and (d) the total amount due (""New Balance"") at the end of 
the billing cycle (which amount is the sum of [a] and [b] less [c]), (e) the 
""Minimum Payment,"" and (f) the ""Payment Due Date."" If Cardholder is 
composed of more than one person, only one periodic statement will be 
provided. 

6. Minimum Payment. Cardholder agrees to pay to Bank, on or prior to 
the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, the sum of (a) 
either (i) the entire New Balance or (ii) at Cardholder's option, an amount 
which shall be at least 2.50% of the New Balance (rounded up to the 
nearest dollar) or $50.00, whichever is greater, and (b) any amount that 
is past due and any amount that is over the Credit Limit. If the New 
Balance is less than $50.00, it shall be paid in full. Cardholder may pay 
more than the Minimum Payment, and may at any time pay the full 
amount owing to Bank. If Cardholder pays more than the Minimum 
Payment, Cardholder must still pay the Minimum Payment as reflected 
on the next periodic statement. The Payment Due Date for a billing cycle 
will be not less than twenty-five (25) days after the preceding billing 
cycle ends (the ""Closing Date""). 

7. Annual Fee: Bank does not charge an annual fee for the Card. 

8. Late Payment Fee. If Bank does not receive a payment from Card-
holder in at least the amount of the Minimum Payment within 30 days 
after the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, Bank may 
charge Cardholder a late payment fee in the amount stated below in the 
Table of Charges. Cardholder will only be charged a late payment fee for 
any Minimum Payment which is not paid within 30 days after the Pay-
ment Due Date. 

9. Cash Advance Fee. Each time Cardholder uses the Card or a Con-
venience Check to obtain a Cash Advance, Bank will assess a cash 
advance fee in the amount stated in the Table of Charges. 

10. When Finance Charge Begins. Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account for all Cash Advances from the later of (a) the day the Cash 
Advance is posted to the Account, or (b) the first day of the billing cycle 
in which the Cash Advance is posted until Cardholder pays the transac-
tion(s) in full. For Credit Purchases, Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account if the Cardholder does not pay the New Balance in full by the 
Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement. If Bank adds a 
Finance Charge, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge on all 
amounts Cardholder owes Bank (except ""New Purchases"") from the first 
day of the billing cycle; provided, however, any portion of the New 
Balance subject to a grace period that is paid prior to the expiration of 
the grace period will not be assessed a Finance Charge. For New 
Purchases, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge from the date 
Bank posts the New Purchase to the Account unless Cardholder has 
paid the New Balance in full on the previous periodic statement. A New 
Purchase is one that appears on the periodic statement for the first time. 

11. Calculation of Finance Charge. Bank calculates the Finance 
Charge on the Account by applying the ""Periodic Rate"" (defined below) 
to the ""Average Daily Balance"" of the Account. To obtain the Average 
Daily Balance, Bank starts with the beginning balance of the Account on 
each day, excluding unpaid Finance Charges. Bank adds any Cash 
Advances posted to the Account that day, and any New Purchases, 
unless Cardholder paid the New Balance in full for the previous billing 
cycle by the Payment Due Date. Bank subtracts any credits and pay-
ments (after any unpaid Finance Charges are paid) posted to the Ac-
count that day. This results in the ""Daily Balance."" Then, Bank adds up 
all the Daily Balances for the billing cycle and divides that by the total 
number of days in the billing cycle. This results in the Average Daily 
Balance. The Finance Charge on the Account is calculated by multiply-
ing the Average Daily Balance by the Periodic Rate for Classic which is 
.008542 and the Periodic Rate for Platinum which is .005208 (but 
subject to change from time to time).

Paying Interest                Cardholder's Payment Due Date is at least 25 
                        days after the close of each billing cycle. Bank 
                        will not charge any interest on purchases if 
                        Cardholder pays the entire balance by the 
                        Payment Due Date each month. Bank will begin

*Bank adds 3% to the Prime Rate to determine Platinum APR (Periodic 
Rate currently .005208). 

For Credit Purchases and Cash Advances which occur on a Platinum 
Account, the APR varies with changes to the Prime Rate. The �Prime 
Rate� is the highest prime rate published in the Money Rates column of 
the Wall Street Journal 30 days before the Closing Date on Cardholder�s 
periodic statement (the �Calculation Date�). On May 1, 2010 the Prime 
Rate was 3.25% therefore the APR was 6.25%. A variable APR will go 
up and down depending on the Prime Rate as of each Calculation Date; 
however, a variable rate APR is subject to change only on the first day of 
each billing cycle. If the Prime Rate and the corresponding APR in-
crease, the Finance Charge also will increase and Cardholder�s Mini-
mum Payment may also increase. The Prime Rate is only a pricing 
index and is not the lowest interest rate available. 

12. Other Payment Terms. All payments received on or before (a) 5 
o'clock p.m. (Fort Worth, Texas time) on Bank's business day at the 
address indicated on the periodic statement, or (b) the closing time of 
the applicable branch if payment is made in person, will be credited to 
the Account as of the date of receipt of payment. If payment is made at 
any other location, credit for the payment may be delayed up to 5 days. 
Bank can accept late or partial payments, as well as payments that are 
marked with ""Paid In Full"" or any other similar language without losing or 
waiving any of Bank�s rights or Cardholder's obligations under this 
Agreement. Payment by check constitutes Cardholder's authorization for 
Bank to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from Cardholder's 
bank to make such payment. Bank is not responsible for any lost or 
stolen cash payments. Payments and credits to the Account will be 
applied in the following order: 

. Unpaid Finance Charge; 
. Late Fee; 
. Cash Advance from previous billing cycle; 
. Credit Purchases from previous billing cycle; 
. Cash Advances from current billing cycle; and 
. Credit Purchases from current billing cycle. 


13. Convenience Checks. Bank may issue ""Convenience Checks"" to 
Cardholder that may be used to access the Account. Use of a Conveni-
ence Check will be treated as a Cash Advance in the amount of the 
Check. Each Convenience Check will contain Cardholder's Account 
Number, and may be used only by the person(s) whose name(s) is/are 
printed on it. Each Convenience Check must be completed and signed in 
the same way as a regular personal check. If Bank provides Conveni-


ence Checks for the Account, Cardholder may not use them to pay any 
amount Cardholder owes under this Agreement. Cardholder agrees that 
Bank need not return Convenience Checks to Cardholder after their use, 
and that, if Cardholder needs evidence of any payment represented by 
the Convenience Check, a photocopy or similar reproduction will be 
satisfactory for such purposes. If Cardholder wishes to prevent payment 
of a Convenience Check, the instructions which Bank provides when the 
Convenience Checks are issued must be followed. In the event payment 
of a Convenience Check has been stopped, Cardholder agrees to hold 
Bank harmless and indemnify Bank for any losses, expenses and costs, 
including attorney's fees incurred by Bank, for preventing payment of 
any Convenience Check. Bank will use its best efforts to stop payment, 
but will incur no liability to Cardholder if it is unable to stop payment on a 
Convenience Check. 

14. Termination. Bank may terminate Cardholder's privileges under this 
Agreement or limit Cardholder's right to make Credit Purchases or 
receive Cash Advances at any time (and list Cardholder's Account in 
warning bulletins in the event of such termination) without any reason or 
without advance notice or resulting liability. If Bank requests, Cardholder 
must return the Card and Convenience Checks to Bank. Cardholder 
agrees that Cardholder will not try to make a Credit Purchase or obtain a 
Cash Advance after Cardholder has been notified that Cardholder's 
privilege to use the Account has been terminated. Cardholder may 
terminate this Agreement at any time. If Cardholder does terminate, all 
Cards and Convenience Checks previously issued on the Account must 
be returned to Bank. If Cardholder telephones Bank with the termination 
request, Bank may require that Cardholder confirm such intent to termi-
nate in writing. Bank's or Cardholder's termination will not affect Card-
holder's existing obligations under this Agreement or Cardholder's 
liability for all charges posted to Cardholder's Account prior to the time 
all Cards and Convenience Checks are returned to Bank. When the 
Account is closed, Cardholder must contact everyone authorized to 
charge transactions to the Account, such as internet service providers, 
health clubs or insurance companies. These transactions may continue 
to be charged to the Account until Cardholder changes the billing. Also, if 
the Bank believes Cardholder has authorized a transaction or is attempt-
ing to use Cardholder�s Account after Cardholder has requested to close 
the Account, Bank may allow the transaction to be charged to the 
Account. If the Account is terminated by Cardholder or by Bank for 
reasons other than Cardholder's default, Cardholder will be required to 
pay the outstanding balance on the Account according to the terms of 
this Agreement immediately prior to such termination. 

15. Default. If (a) Cardholder defaults in any payment required to be 
made on the Account or otherwise violates any provision of this Agree-
ment, or (b) Cardholder dies or seeks to obtain any relief as a debtor in 
any proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor relief law, or 
(c) Cardholder provides Bank with false or misleading information or 
signatures at any time, or (d) Cardholder fails to make any payment or 
perform any promise in any other agreement or obligation that Card-
holder owes Bank, then Cardholder will be in default under this Agree-
ment. Bank, upon such default, may at its election (a) decline to extend 
further credit under this Agreement (and Cardholder agrees not to make 
further Credit Purchases or to obtain further Cash Advances) and (b) 
declare all amounts then owed to Bank by Cardholder immediately due 
and payable, without prior notice or demand of any kind, except as may 
be required by applicable law. After Bank declares all amounts then 
owed to Bank by Cardholder to be due and payable, and terminates 
Cardholder�s credit privileges under the Account Bank, at its option (but 
only after providing to Cardholder notice if such is required by applicable 
law), may increase the Annual Percentage Rate up to 18%, which is the 
Default Rate under the Table of Charges. 

16. Collection Charges. If Cardholder defaults, to the extent permitted 
by applicable law, Cardholder agrees to pay (a) all amounts actually 
incurred by Bank as court costs and attorneys' fees set by a court in 
connection with the collection of amounts due by Cardholder under the 
Account and (b) premiums or other identifiable charges received in 
connection with the permitted sale of insurance. In addition, Bank may 
impose on Cardholder a processing fee of $20.00 if a check provided to 
Bank by Cardholder is dishonored for any reason. The dishonored check 
processing fee may be added to the New Balance and is payable on the 
next following due date, however, such fee will not accrue any Finance 
Charge. 

17. Governing Law. This Agreement is performable in Texas and is 
made pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance 
Code, as amended. THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, AND EN-
FORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL MATTERS ARISING 
OUT OF THE ISSUANCE AND USE OF THE CARD SHALL BE GO-
VERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND, TO THE 
EXTENT APPLICABLE, THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. 

18. Amendment. The terms of this Agreement including, but not limited 
to, the rate or index, formula or provision of law used to compute the 
ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are subject to revision as to current and 
future balances, from time to time, by written notice from Bank to Card-
holder as provided by applicable law. 

19. Telephone Conversations. Cardholder agrees that Bank, its 
agents, or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone 
communications with Cardholder. 

20. Liability for Unauthorized Use. Cardholder may be liable for 
unauthorized use of the Account. If the Card is lost or stolen, or if Card-
holder believes someone is using the Account without proper authority, 
Cardholder must notify Bank immediately by calling 1-800-325-3678. 
Cardholder will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after 
Cardholder notifies Bank of the loss or theft of the Card or Convenience 
Check, or the possible unauthorized use of the Account. Bank may 
terminate or limit access to the Account if Cardholder has notified Bank, 
or if Bank has determined that the Card or Convenience Check may 
have been lost or stolen, or that there may be unauthorized access to 
the Account. Cardholder agrees to provide Bank with complete coopera-
tion in Bank's efforts to recover any stolen Card or Convenience Check 
and amounts due from unauthorized users, and in prosecuting unautho-
rized users. 

21. Bank�s Liability for Failing to Make Transfers. If Bank does not 
complete a transaction to or from the Account on time or in the correct 
amount according to this Agreement, Bank may be liable for Cardhold-
er's losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. Bank will 
not be liable, for instance: (a) if, through no fault of Bank's, the available 
credit is insufficient for the transaction or is unavailable for withdrawal 
(for example, because funds have not been finally collected or are 
subject to legal process); (b) if a computer system, ATM, or point of sale 
terminal did not have enough cash or was not working properly and 
Cardholder knew about the problem when Cardholder started the trans-
action; (c) if Cardholder attempts to use the Account or the Card which 
has not been properly activated; (d) if the Card has been reported as lost 
or stolen, has been suspended by Bank or Bank has reason to believe 
the transaction is not authorized by Cardholder, or if Cardholder is trying 
to defraud Bank; or (e) as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

22. Assignment of Account. Cardholder agrees that Bank may at any 
time assign and transfer Cardholder's Account, this Agreement, and 
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, without Cardholder's 
consent or notice to Cardholder. The person to whom the Account and 
Agreement is assigned shall be entitled to all of Bank's rights under this 
Agreement. 

23. Information Sharing. Cardholder authorizes Bank to share informa-
tion concerning Cardholder and Cardholder�s Account with companies 
related to Bank by common ownership. Cardholder authorizes Bank to 
share information with companies in which Bank has an ownership 
interest, concerning purchases made by Cardholder using Cardholder�s 
Account, for the purpose of obtaining special merchandise offers or 
discounts for Cardholder. Cardholder does not authorize Bank to dis-
close Cardholder�s name, address, telephone number or other personal 
information to these companies. 

24. Credit Reporting Agencies. Bank may give information about 
Cardholder's payment history under this Agreement to other persons or 
companies when permitted by law. Cardholder authorizes Bank to make 
whatever credit or investigative inquiries Bank deems necessary in the 
course of review of any credit extended under this Agreement. A nega-
tive credit report which may affect Cardholder's credit record may be 
submitted to a credit reporting agency if Cardholder fails to keep Card-
holder's promises under this Agreement. 

25. Delay of Rights. Bank can waive or delay enforcement of any of its 
rights under this Agreement without losing them. 

26. Separable Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to 
be invalid or enforceable, the rest of this Agreement will not be affected. 
Cardholder will not be held liable for Finance Charges or other fees and 
charges greater than the maximum allowed by law that applies. 

27. Limitation of Responsibility. Bank will not be responsible for 
merchandise or services purchased by Cardholder with the Card or 
Convenience Check unless required by law. Any refund, adjustment or 
credit allowed by a Seller shall not be cash, but rather be by a credit 
advice to Bank which shall be shown as a credit on the periodic state-
ment. Bank will not be responsible for the refusal of any person to honor 
the Card or Convenience Check or if Cardholder is not able to use the 
Card at an ATM. (a) Bank will not be responsible for merchandise or 
services purchased by Cardholder with the Card or Convenience Check 
unless required by law. Any refund, adjustment or credit allowed by a 
Seller shall not be cash, but rather be by a credit advice to Bank which

responsible for the refusal of any person to honor the Card or Conveni-
ence Check or if Cardholder is not able to use the Card at an ATM[; and

TO HONOR THE CARD; THE FAILURE OF MERCHANTS TO PER-
FORM OR PROVIDE SERVICES; COMMUNICATION SYSTEMFAI-
LURES; OR FAILURES OR MALFUNCTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO 
CARDHOLDER'S EQUIPMENT, ANY INTERNET SERVICE, OR ANY 
PAYMENT SYSTEM. IN THE EVENT THAT BANK IS HELD LIABLE 
TO CARDHOLDER, CARDHOLDER WILL ONLY BE ENTITLED TO 
RECOVER CARDHOLDER'S ACTUAL DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT 
SHALL CARDHOLDER BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ANY INDIRECT, 
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (WHETH-
ER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF CARDHOLDER 
HAS ADVISED BANK OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
THIS PROVISION SHALL NOT BE EFFECTIVE TO THE EXTENT 
OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW. 

28. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies. If Cardholder makes a 
transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be converted by 
Visa into a U.S. dollar amount in accordance with the operating regula-
tions or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is 
processed. Currently, those regulations and procedures provide that the 
currency conversion rate to be used is either (a) a wholesale market rate 
or (b) a government-mandated rate in effect one (1) day prior to the 
processing date, increased by one percent (1%) in each case. Visa 
retains this one percent as compensation for performing the currency 
conversion service. The currency conversion rate in effect on the 
processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date 
or the posting date. 

29. USA Patriot Act. Bank is subject to the requirement of the USA 
Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107 56 [signed into law October 26, 2001]) 
(the �Act�) and hereby notifies Cardholder that pursuant to the require-
ments of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify, and record information 
that identifies Cardholder which information includes the name and 
address of Cardholder and other information that will allow such Bank to 
identify Cardholder in accordance with the Act. 

30. Other Agreements. This Agreement supersedes all prior Agree-
ments between Bank and Cardholder governing the use of the Card and 
the Account.

creditcardagreement_1368.TXT,"First Command Bank Visa Cardholder Agreement (Platinum/Classic)

The person(s) (""Cardholder,"" whether one or more) who signed and 
returned the Application for a Visa (""Application"") has requested First 
Command Bank (""Bank"") to extend to Cardholder open-end credit. The 
term ""Cardholder"" means each person who signed and returned the 
Application and any other person who has agreed to be responsible for 
the Account (defined below). As used in this Agreement, the term 
�person� means an individual or an entity, as applicable. By Cardholder's 
use of the credit card (""Card""), furnished by Bank in reliance in part upon 
the information supplied by Cardholder in the Application, Cardholder 
agrees with Bank as follows: 

1. Using the Account. Cardholder has accepted the revolving tri-party 
account (""Account"") made available to Cardholder by Bank. Cardholder 
may use the Card to purchase or lease goods or services, or pay 
amounts that Cardholder owes, wherever the Card is honored (""Credit 
Purchases""). Cardholder may also use the Card to obtain cash loans 
(""Cash Advances"") from any financial institution that accepts the Card. 
Cardholder agrees that the Account will not be used to access gambling 
web sites or to purchase illegal goods or services. Bank may refuse to 
process any transaction that Bank believes may violate this Agreement. 
If Cardholder provides the Account number to make a purchase or 
obtain an advance without presenting the Card (such as for a mail order 
or telephone purchase), or if Cardholder authorizes someone else to 
make a charge to the Account, Cardholder's obligation to pay will be the 
same as if the Card itself was used. Cash Advances also may be ob-
tained through use of the Card (a) upon execution of a written request of 
Cardholder in a form furnished by any financial institution that is a 
member, alone or in association with others, of Visa, Inc. or (b) upon 
Cardholder's execution of a written separate agreement with Bank for a 
Visa overdraft financial agreement, if offered by Bank. All Credit Pur-
chases and Cash Advances are effected at the option of the retail 
merchant (""Seller"") and/or cash advancing financial institution respec-
tively, and Bank shall not be responsible for refusal by any Seller or 
cash advancing financial institution to honor the Card or any ""Related 
Card,"" as defined in paragraph 2 below. 

2. Obligations on the Account. Cardholder (jointly or severally if more 
than one) promises to pay Bank at the address specified on the periodic 
statement (see paragraph 5 below) for all Credit Purchases and Cash 
Advances, together with any Finance Charge as herein provided, plus 
any other charges permitted by this Agreement, all such payments must 
be in lawful money of the United States of America. Cardholder will pay 
in their equivalent in U.S. dollars all charges in a foreign currency, which 
equivalence will be determined by reference to the amount in U.S. 
dollars. Bank shall have paid in good faith to the person presenting the 
item to Bank. Cardholder shall be liable and agrees to pay Bank for 
Credit Purchases made by, or for Cash Advances extended to, Card-
holder or anyone else using the Card unless the use of such Card is by a 
person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, implied, 
or apparent authority for such use and (b) from which Cardholder rece-
ives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally 
liable, and agrees to pay, for all Credit Purchases and Cash Advances 
obtained through the use of any other Card bearing Cardholder's Ac-
count number that has been issued to another person by reason of such 
person being a member of Cardholder's family, or otherwise issued upon 
Cardholder's request (all such Cards bearing the same Account number 
hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). Subject to any mandato-
ry provisions of applicable law, all payments made by Cardholder will be 
applied to the balances on Cardholder's Account in the manner set forth 
later in this Agreement. 

3. Credit Limit. Bank will inform Cardholder from time to time of the 
maximum amount of debt (""Credit Limit"") that may be outstanding in the 
Account at any time, and Bank, in its sole discretion may adjust the 
Credit Limit from time to time. Cardholder agrees not to use or permit the 
use of the Card in any manner that would cause the outstanding balance 
in the Account ever to exceed the Credit Limit. If Cardholder attempts a 
transaction which results in Cardholder�s total outstanding balance (plus 
authorizations) exceeding Cardholder's Credit Limit, Bank may: (a) 
permit the transaction without raising Cardholder's Credit Limit; (b) 
permit the transaction and treat the amount of the transaction that is 
more than the Credit Limit as immediately due; or (c) refuse to permit the 
transaction. If Bank refuses to permit the transaction, Bank may advise 
the person who attempted the transaction that it has been refused. If 
Bank has previously permitted Cardholder to exceed Cardholder's Credit 
Limit, it does not mean that Bank will permit Cardholder to exceed 
Cardholder's Credit Limit on a subsequent date. Bank may designate 
that only a portion of Cardholder's Credit Limit is available for Cash 
Advances. If Cardholder exceeds that limit, Cardholder will be consi-
dered to have exceeded the Credit Limit for all purposes under this 
Agreement. 

4. Notices. Bank will send periodic statements and any other notices to 
Cardholder at the address shown in Bank's files. If this is a joint Account, 
Bank can send periodic statements and notices to either Cardholder. 
Cardholder promises to inform Bank promptly, in writing, of any changes 
in Cardholder's address. Cardholder authorizes Bank, or anyone acting 
on Bank's behalf, to call or send a text message to any number Card-
holder provides or to any number where Bank may reasonably believe 
Bank can contact cardholder, including calls to mobile, cellular, or 
similar devices, and calls using automatic telephone dialing systems 
and/or pre-recorded messages, or to send an email to any address 
where Bank reasonably believes Bank can contact Cardholder. Calls 
and messages may be made for any lawful purpose, including but not 
limited to: suspected fraud or identity theft; obtaining information; Card-
holder's account transactions or servicing; collecting on Cardholder's 
account; and providing Cardholder information about products and 
services. 

5. Periodic Statement. As of the end of each monthly billing cycle, 
Cardholder will be furnished a periodic statement showing, among other 
things, (a) the amount owed (""Previous Balance"") at the beginning of the 
billing cycle, (b) the amount of all Cash Advances, Credit Purchases and 
Finance Charge posted to the Account during the billing cycle, (c) the 
amount of all payments and credits posted to the Account during the 
billing cycle, and (d) the total amount due (""New Balance"") at the end of 
the billing cycle (which amount is the sum of [a] and [b] less [c]), (e) the 
""Minimum Payment,"" and (f) the ""Payment Due Date."" If Cardholder is 
composed of more than one person, only one periodic statement will be 
provided. 

6. Minimum Payment. Cardholder agrees to pay to Bank, on or prior to 
the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, the sum of (a) 
either (i) the entire New Balance or (ii) at Cardholder's option, an amount 
which shall be at least 2.50% of the New Balance (rounded up to the 
nearest dollar) or $50.00, whichever is greater, and (b) any amount that 
is past due and any amount that is over the Credit Limit. If the New 
Balance is less than $50.00, it shall be paid in full. Cardholder may pay 
more than the Minimum Payment, and may at any time pay the full 
amount owing to Bank. If Cardholder pays more than the Minimum 
Payment, Cardholder must still pay the Minimum Payment as reflected 
on the next periodic statement. The Payment Due Date for a billing cycle 
will be not less than twenty-five (25) days after the preceding billing 
cycle ends (the ""Closing Date""). 

7. Annual Fee: Bank does not charge an annual fee for the Card. 

8. Late Payment Fee. If Bank does not receive a payment from Card-
holder in at least the amount of the Minimum Payment within 30 days 
after the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, Bank may 
charge Cardholder a late payment fee in the amount stated below in the 
Table of Charges. Cardholder will only be charged a late payment fee for 
any Minimum Payment which is not paid within 30 days after the Pay-
ment Due Date. 

9. Cash Advance Fee. Each time Cardholder uses the Card or a Con-
venience Check to obtain a Cash Advance, Bank will assess a cash 
advance fee in the amount stated in the Table of Charges. 

10. When Finance Charge Begins. Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account for all Cash Advances from the later of (a) the day the Cash 
Advance is posted to the Account, or (b) the first day of the billing cycle 
in which the Cash Advance is posted until Cardholder pays the transac-
tion(s) in full. For Credit Purchases, Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account if the Cardholder does not pay the New Balance in full by the 
Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement. If Bank adds a 
Finance Charge, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge on all 
amounts Cardholder owes Bank (except ""New Purchases"") from the first 
day of the billing cycle; provided, however, any portion of the New 
Balance subject to a grace period that is paid prior to the expiration of 
the grace period will not be assessed a Finance Charge. For New 
Purchases, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge from the date 
Bank posts the New Purchase to the Account unless Cardholder has 
paid the New Balance in full on the previous periodic statement. A New 
Purchase is one that appears on the periodic statement for the first time. 

11. Calculation of Finance Charge. Bank calculates the Finance 
Charge on the Account by applying the ""Periodic Rate"" (defined below) 
to the ""Average Daily Balance"" of the Account. To obtain the Average 
Daily Balance, Bank starts with the beginning balance of the Account on 
each day, excluding unpaid Finance Charges. Bank adds any Cash 
Advances posted to the Account that day, and any New Purchases, 
unless Cardholder paid the New Balance in full for the previous billing 
cycle by the Payment Due Date. Bank subtracts any credits and pay-
ments (after any unpaid Finance Charges are paid) posted to the Ac-
count that day. This results in the ""Daily Balance."" Then, Bank adds up 
all the Daily Balances for the billing cycle and divides that by the total 
number of days in the billing cycle. This results in the Average Daily 
Balance. The Finance Charge on the Account is calculated by multiply-
ing the Average Daily Balance by the Periodic Rate for Classic which is 
.008542 and the Periodic Rate for Platinum which is .005208 (but 
subject to change from time to time).

Default APR and         18% 
When It Applies         This APR may be applied to Cardholder's 
                        account when the full balance becomes due and 
                        payable and Cardholder has been notified of the 
                        APR increase. 

Paying Interest                Cardholder's Payment Due Date is at least 25 
                        days after the close of each billing cycle. Bank 
                        will not charge any interest on purchases if 
                        Cardholder pays the entire balance by the 
                        Payment Due Date each month. Bank will begin 
                        charging interest on Cash Advances on the 
                        transaction date.

*Bank adds 3% to the Prime Rate to determine Platinum APR (Periodic 
Rate currently .005208). 

For Credit Purchases and Cash Advances which occur on a Platinum 
Account, the APR varies with changes to the Prime Rate. The �Prime 
Rate� is the highest prime rate published in the Money Rates column of 
the Wall Street Journal 30 days before the Closing Date on Cardholder�s 
periodic statement (the �Calculation Date�). On May 1, 2010 the Prime 
Rate was 3.25% therefore the APR was 6.25%. A variable APR will go 
up and down depending on the Prime Rate as of each Calculation Date; 
however, a variable rate APR is subject to change only on the first day of 
each billing cycle. If the Prime Rate and the corresponding APR in-
crease, the Finance Charge also will increase and Cardholder�s Mini-
mum Payment may also increase. The Prime Rate is only a pricing 
index and is not the lowest interest rate available. 

12. Other Payment Terms. All payments received on or before (a) 5 
o'clock p.m. (Fort Worth, Texas time) on Bank's business day at the 
address indicated on the periodic statement, or (b) the closing time of 
the applicable branch if payment is made in person, will be credited to 
the Account as of the date of receipt of payment. If payment is made at 
any other location, credit for the payment may be delayed up to 5 days. 
Bank can accept late or partial payments, as well as payments that are 
marked with ""Paid In Full"" or any other similar language without losing or 
waiving any of Bank�s rights or Cardholder's obligations under this 
Agreement. Payment by check constitutes Cardholder's authorization for 
Bank to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from Cardholder's 
bank to make such payment. Bank is not responsible for any lost or 
stolen cash payments. Payments and credits to the Account will be 
applied in the following order: 

. Unpaid Finance Charge; 
. Late Fee; 
. Cash Advance from previous billing cycle; 
. Credit Purchases from previous billing cycle; 
. Cash Advances from current billing cycle; and 
. Credit Purchases from current billing cycle. 


13. Convenience Checks. Bank may issue ""Convenience Checks"" to 
Cardholder that may be used to access the Account. Use of a Conveni-
ence Check will be treated as a Cash Advance in the amount of the 
Check. Each Convenience Check will contain Cardholder's Account 
Number, and may be used only by the person(s) whose name(s) is/are 
printed on it. Each Convenience Check must be completed and signed in 
the same way as a regular personal check. If Bank provides Conveni-


ence Checks for the Account, Cardholder may not use them to pay any 
amount Cardholder owes under this Agreement. Cardholder agrees that 
Bank need not return Convenience Checks to Cardholder after their use, 
and that, if Cardholder needs evidence of any payment represented by 
the Convenience Check, a photocopy or similar reproduction will be 
satisfactory for such purposes. If Cardholder wishes to prevent payment 
of a Convenience Check, the instructions which Bank provides when the 
Convenience Checks are issued must be followed. In the event payment 
of a Convenience Check has been stopped, Cardholder agrees to hold 
Bank harmless and indemnify Bank for any losses, expenses and costs, 
including attorney's fees incurred by Bank, for preventing payment of 
any Convenience Check. Bank will use its best efforts to stop payment, 
but will incur no liability to Cardholder if it is unable to stop payment on a 
Convenience Check. 

14. Termination. Bank may terminate Cardholder's privileges under this 
Agreement or limit Cardholder's right to make Credit Purchases or 
receive Cash Advances at any time (and list Cardholder's Account in 
warning bulletins in the event of such termination) without any reason or 
without advance notice or resulting liability. If Bank requests, Cardholder 
must return the Card and Convenience Checks to Bank. Cardholder 
agrees that Cardholder will not try to make a Credit Purchase or obtain a 
Cash Advance after Cardholder has been notified that Cardholder's 
privilege to use the Account has been terminated. Cardholder may 
terminate this Agreement at any time. If Cardholder does terminate, all 
Cards and Convenience Checks previously issued on the Account must 
be returned to Bank. If Cardholder telephones Bank with the termination 
request, Bank may require that Cardholder confirm such intent to termi-
nate in writing. Bank's or Cardholder's termination will not affect Card-
holder's existing obligations under this Agreement or Cardholder's 
liability for all charges posted to Cardholder's Account prior to the time 
all Cards and Convenience Checks are returned to Bank. When the 
Account is closed, Cardholder must contact everyone authorized to 
charge transactions to the Account, such as internet service providers, 
health clubs or insurance companies. These transactions may continue 
to be charged to the Account until Cardholder changes the billing. Also, if 
the Bank believes Cardholder has authorized a transaction or is attempt-
ing to use Cardholder�s Account after Cardholder has requested to close 
the Account, Bank may allow the transaction to be charged to the 
Account. If the Account is terminated by Cardholder or by Bank for 
reasons other than Cardholder's default, Cardholder will be required to 
pay the outstanding balance on the Account according to the terms of 
this Agreement immediately prior to such termination. 

15. Default. If (a) Cardholder defaults in any payment required to be 
made on the Account or otherwise violates any provision of this Agree-
ment, or (b) Cardholder dies or seeks to obtain any relief as a debtor in 
any proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor relief law, or 
(c) Cardholder provides Bank with false or misleading information or 
signatures at any time, or (d) Cardholder fails to make any payment or 
perform any promise in any other agreement or obligation that Card-
holder owes Bank, then Cardholder will be in default under this Agree-
ment. Bank, upon such default, may at its election (a) decline to extend 
further credit under this Agreement (and Cardholder agrees not to make 
further Credit Purchases or to obtain further Cash Advances) and (b) 
declare all amounts then owed to Bank by Cardholder immediately due 
and payable, without prior notice or demand of any kind, except as may 
be required by applicable law. After Bank declares all amounts then 
owed to Bank by Cardholder to be due and payable, and terminates 
Cardholder�s credit privileges under the Account Bank, at its option (but 
only after providing to Cardholder notice if such is required by applicable 
law), may increase the Annual Percentage Rate up to 18%, which is the 
Default Rate under the Table of Charges. 

16. Collection Charges. If Cardholder defaults, to the extent permitted 
by applicable law, Cardholder agrees to pay (a) all amounts actually 
incurred by Bank as court costs and attorneys' fees set by a court in 
connection with the collection of amounts due by Cardholder under the 
Account and (b) premiums or other identifiable charges received in 
connection with the permitted sale of insurance. In addition, Bank may 
impose on Cardholder a processing fee of $20.00 if a check provided to 
Bank by Cardholder is dishonored for any reason. The dishonored check 
processing fee may be added to the New Balance and is payable on the 
next following due date, however, such fee will not accrue any Finance 
Charge. 

17. Governing Law. This Agreement is performable in Texas and is 
made pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance 
Code, as amended. THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, AND EN-
FORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL MATTERS ARISING 
OUT OF THE ISSUANCE AND USE OF THE CARD SHALL BE GO-
VERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND, TO THE 
EXTENT APPLICABLE, THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. 

18. Amendment. The terms of this Agreement including, but not limited 
to, the rate or index, formula or provision of law used to compute the 
ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are subject to revision as to current and 
future balances, from time to time, by written notice from Bank to Card-
holder as provided by applicable law. 

19. Telephone Conversations. Cardholder agrees that Bank, its 
agents, or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone 
communications with Cardholder. 

20. Liability for Unauthorized Use. Cardholder may be liable for 
unauthorized use of the Account. If the Card is lost or stolen, or if Card-
holder believes someone is using the Account without proper authority, 
Cardholder must notify Bank immediately by calling 1-800-325-3678. 
Cardholder will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after 
Cardholder notifies Bank of the loss or theft of the Card or Convenience 
Check, or the possible unauthorized use of the Account. Bank may 
terminate or limit access to the Account if Cardholder has notified Bank, 
or if Bank has determined that the Card or Convenience Check may 
have been lost or stolen, or that there may be unauthorized access to 
the Account. Cardholder agrees to provide Bank with complete coopera-
tion in Bank's efforts to recover any stolen Card or Convenience Check 
and amounts due from unauthorized users, and in prosecuting unautho-
rized users. 

21. Bank�s Liability for Failing to Make Transfers. If Bank does not 
complete a transaction to or from the Account on time or in the correct 
amount according to this Agreement, Bank may be liable for Cardhold-
er's losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. Bank will 
not be liable, for instance: (a) if, through no fault of Bank's, the available 
credit is insufficient for the transaction or is unavailable for withdrawal 
(for example, because funds have not been finally collected or are 
subject to legal process); (b) if a computer system, ATM, or point of sale 
terminal did not have enough cash or was not working properly and 
Cardholder knew about the problem when Cardholder started the trans-
action; (c) if Cardholder attempts to use the Account or the Card which 
has not been properly activated; (d) if the Card has been reported as lost 
or stolen, has been suspended by Bank or Bank has reason to believe 
the transaction is not authorized by Cardholder, or if Cardholder is trying 
to defraud Bank; or (e) as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

22. Assignment of Account. Cardholder agrees that Bank may at any 
time assign and transfer Cardholder's Account, this Agreement, and 
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, without Cardholder's 
consent or notice to Cardholder. The person to whom the Account and 
Agreement is assigned shall be entitled to all of Bank's rights under this 
Agreement. 

23. Information Sharing. Cardholder authorizes Bank to share informa-
tion concerning Cardholder and Cardholder�s Account with companies 
related to Bank by common ownership. Cardholder authorizes Bank to 
share information with companies in which Bank has an ownership 
interest, concerning purchases made by Cardholder using Cardholder�s 
Account, for the purpose of obtaining special merchandise offers or 
discounts for Cardholder. Cardholder does not authorize Bank to dis-
close Cardholder�s name, address, telephone number or other personal 
information to these companies. 

24. Credit Reporting Agencies. Bank may give information about 
Cardholder's payment history under this Agreement to other persons or 
companies when permitted by law. Cardholder authorizes Bank to make 
whatever credit or investigative inquiries Bank deems necessary in the 
course of review of any credit extended under this Agreement. A nega-
tive credit report which may affect Cardholder's credit record may be 
submitted to a credit reporting agency if Cardholder fails to keep Card-
holder's promises under this Agreement. 

25. Delay of Rights. Bank can waive or delay enforcement of any of its 
rights under this Agreement without losing them. 

26. Separable Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to 
be invalid or enforceable, the rest of this Agreement will not be affected. 
Cardholder will not be held liable for Finance Charges or other fees and 
charges greater than the maximum allowed by law that applies. 

27. Limitation of Responsibility. Bank will not be responsible for 
merchandise or services purchased by Cardholder with the Card or 
Convenience Check unless required by law. Any refund, adjustment or 
credit allowed by a Seller shall not be cash, but rather be by a credit 
advice to Bank which shall be shown as a credit on the periodic state-
ment. Bank will not be responsible for the refusal of any person to honor 
the Card or Convenience Check or if Cardholder is not able to use the 
Card at an ATM. (a) Bank will not be responsible for merchandise or 
services purchased by Cardholder with the Card or Convenience Check

responsible for the refusal of any person to honor the Card or Conveni-
ence Check or if Cardholder is not able to use the Card at an ATM[; and

CARDHOLDER'S EQUIPMENT, ANY INTERNET SERVICE, OR ANY 
PAYMENT SYSTEM. IN THE EVENT THAT BANK IS HELD LIABLE 
TO CARDHOLDER, CARDHOLDER WILL ONLY BE ENTITLED TO 
RECOVER CARDHOLDER'S ACTUAL DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT 
SHALL CARDHOLDER BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ANY INDIRECT, 
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (WHETH-
ER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF CARDHOLDER 
HAS ADVISED BANK OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
THIS PROVISION SHALL NOT BE EFFECTIVE TO THE EXTENT 
OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW. 

28. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies. If Cardholder makes a 
transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be converted by 
Visa into a U.S. dollar amount in accordance with the operating regula-
tions or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is 
processed. Currently, those regulations and procedures provide that the 
currency conversion rate to be used is either (a) a wholesale market rate 
or (b) a government-mandated rate in effect one (1) day prior to the 
processing date, increased by one percent (1%) in each case. Visa 
retains this one percent as compensation for performing the currency 
conversion service. The currency conversion rate in effect on the 
processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date 
or the posting date.

address of Cardholder and other information that will allow such Bank to

1. 
Introduction. This Agreement covers this VISA Platinum Credit Card issued by iQ Credit Union (�Lender�). In this Agreement the words �you,� �your,� �yours,� �applicant,� and �Bor�rowers� mean any person who signs the application for this Account, any joint obligor, guarantor, authorized user,or the person whose name is embossed on the Card. The words �we,��us,��our,� and �Lender� means iQ Credit Union. The word �Card� means any one or more credit cards issued under this Account.  If you sign an application for this Account or sign or use any Card or PIN, or allow others to use the Card or PIN, you and they will have accepted this Agreement just as if you and they signed it, and you and they, jointly and severally, will be bound by the following terms and conditions which will govern this Account. 

2. 
You Promise to Pay. You promise to pay us in United States dollars, by cash, check or money order as provided in this Agreement, all such amounts, plus FINANCE CHARGES, which arise from use of the Card or Account by you or any other person, and to be jointly and severally liable with such a person, unless such other person does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and you received no bene.t from the use. This includes any loan requests for credit card purchases, payments to a third party, or for deposit to a deposit, share, or share draft account of yours, or any co-applicant at the Credit Union. You agree to pay advances requested by any co-applicant the same as if you asked for the loan and it was paid to you. 

3. 
Purchases and Cash Advances. You must sign the Card to use it. Once you have signed the Card, you can use it to buy or lease goods or services, wherever the Card is honored, up to the full amount of your credit line. You also may use your Account and Card to get cash advances from us or participating .nancial institutions. You may use your Card and Personal Identi.cation Number (�PIN�) to obtain cash advances at automated teller machines (�ATMs�) designated with the VISA or Plus System networks. The periodic statement will identify the merchant or .nancial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. We may impose a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request. 

4. 
Convenience Checks. If we approve, you may obtain advances under your Account by writing preprinted loan drafts (�convenience checks�) that we supply to you. Your use of conve�nience checks will be shown as credit advances on your periodic statement. We may not honor the convenience check if it is postdated, payment of the check will exceed your credit limit, a convenience check is signed by a person without authorized access, the amount of the check is less than the minimum required amount, your Account has been terminated or suspended, or any convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen. You may stop payment on a convenience check if you provide us with the exact information describing the convenience check. If you give us incorrect information, we will not be responsible for failing to stop payment. You understand there may be a charge for convenience check printing and charges for stop payment requests, returned items, check copies, and other fees or costs we incur in handling your convenience checks. Our liability for a wrongful dishonor is limited to your actual losses; however, a dishonor for the reasons stated above is not a wrongful dishonor. 

5. 	
Rebate Program. You may earn a 1.00% cash rebate on your Account if you meet the following requirements: 

a. 
Cash Rebate on Net Purchases. You may earn a .50% cash rebate on net purchases (purchases less returns for credit) made during a rebate period in which the net purchases posted to your Account total $2,500 or more. Cash advance transactions, including convenience checks and balance transfers, do not qualify for the cash rebate. The cash rebate will be calculated on cumulative net purchases posted to your Account for the prior rebate period. To illustrate, let us assume that during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) your total net purchases equal $3,500. In this example, we would multiply $3,500 by .50%, which would equal a cash rebate of $17.50. 

b. 
Cash Rebate on Average Daily Balance. 	You may earn a .50% cash rebate on the average daily balance in your Account if you maintain an average daily balance of $4,000 during a rebate period. The cash rebate will be calculated each quarter based on the average daily balance in your Account for the prior rebate period. For example, if the average daily balance in your Account during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) was $5,800, we would multiply $5,800 by .50%; which would equal a cash rebate of $29.00. 




There are four rebate periods in each calendar year:January 1 through March 31,April 1 through June 30,July 1 through September 30,and October 1 through December 31.The cash rebate for the prior rebate period will be credited to your checking or savings account by the 15th day of the month following the end of the prior rebate period. The maximum cash rebate you can earn on your Account is $300 per quarter, inclusive of cash rebates for net purchases and average daily balances. Your Account must remain open and in good standing in order to receive the cash rebate. If at any time your Account is assessed a late fee, is closed or is in default, you will forfeit all cash rebates accrued through the calendar quarter in which your Account was closed, or the delinquency or default occurred. The terms and conditions of this rebate program may be changed or cancelled at any time and for any reason without notice. 
6. 
Minimum Periodic Payment. You agree that you will pay each month not less than the minimum payment on or before the scheduled due date. The minimum payment will be three percent (3.0%) of your outstanding balance or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the greater of any amount past due or any amount in excess of your credit line. 

7. 
Periodic Statements. If, at the end of any monthly periodic interval which we may determine the �Billing Cycle,� you have an outstanding undisputed debit or credit balance in your Account, or if there is any FINANCE CHARGE imposed with respect to your Account, we will send you a periodic statement regarding the Account for that Billing Cycle. The statement will show any purchases, cash advances, payments, and credits made to your Account during the Billing Cycle, as well as your �New Balance,� any FINANCE CHARGE, any late charge, or other charges. You may elect to receive your statement information electronically. Your statement also will identify the �Required Payment Due� you must make for that Billing Cycle and the date it is due. You may pay in full for all your purchases and cash advances each month or you may repay in monthly installments. You agree to retain for state�ment veri.cation copies of transaction slips resulting from each purchase, each advance, and other transaction on your Account. Unless you notify us of a billing error as described below, you accept your monthly statement as an accurate statement of your Account with us. 

8. 
Credit Line. This Agreement will constitute a revolving line of credit, and we will advise you of the amount of your credit line. That amount will be the maximum amount you may have outstanding at any one time. You agree not to attempt to obtain more credit than the amount of your credit line. However, if you temporarily exceed your credit line, you agree to pay any overlimit fees and repay the excess immediately, even if we have not yet billed you. Obtaining such credit does not increase your credit line. We retain the right to increase or decrease your credit line at any time for any reason. Any increase or reduction on the limit of your credit line will be shown on your monthly statement or by separate notice together with any changes in the applicable minimum monthly payments. The minimum credit limit is $5,000. 

9. 
Circumstances Under Which a FINANCE CHARGE Will Be Imposed. The total outstanding balance of purchases and cash advances in the Account on the closing date of a Billing Cycle, including any FINANCE CHARGE will be shown on the Periodic Statement for that billing cycle as the �New Balance.� 

a. 
Purchases. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the closing date. This �grace period� allows you to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases for a billing cycle. If you do not pay the entire New Balance within the grace period, your FINANCE CHARGE will accrue from the date of purchase. 

b. 
Cash Advances. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances from the date each cash advance is made. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid a periodic FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances. In addition, a cash advance fee (FINANCE CHARGE) equal to 2% of the cash advance (or $10.00, whichever is greater) will be applied to each cash advance. 



10. 
Method Used to Determine the Balance on Which the FINANCE CHARGE May Be Computed. We .gure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Account by applying the Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of purchases and cash advances for your Account (not including current transactions). To get the �Average Daily Balance� we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid FINANCE CHARGES and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the �Average Daily Balance.� 

11. 
Method of Determining the Amount of the FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE imposed on purchases and cash advances with respect to a Billing Cycle, will be determined by multi�plying the Average Daily Balance of purchases and cash advances by the number of days in the Billing Cycle and then by the rate disclosed in the next paragraph. The FINANCE CHARGE for any Billing Cycle will be the sum of the FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and the FINANCE CHARGE for cash advances. However, the portion of your balance that is the result of purchases has a different treatment if you pay all of that portion by at least twenty .ve (25 days) after we send your billing statement. In 


that event, we will zero out the FINANCE CHARGE that would otherwise be charged on that portion of your account balance. For this purpose, payments will be applied .rst to unpaid FINANCE CHARGES, then to unpaid purchases and cash advances from prior billing statements (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate), then to purchases and cash advances during that Billing Cycle (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate). 
12. (a) Purchases. Periodic Rate and Corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The Periodic Rate that is used to compute the FINANCE CHARGE and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is variable, and will change based on changes in an index, which is the Prime Rate quoted on the 15th day of the last month of the prior quarter as published in The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition).We add a margin of 4.99 percentage points to the index to obtain the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE includes only interest and not other costs. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is divided by 365 to produce the daily Periodic Rate. The Periodic Rate and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that will apply to your Account will be disclosed on the notice that accompanies (and is a part of) this Agreement when you open your Account. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will in no event be higher than 18%, or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law, or fall below 5.99% over the life of the credit line. The rate will be adjusted on the twenty .rst day of each calendar quarter (January 21, April 21, July 21, and October 21). 
12. 
(b).Cash Advances. The Daily Periodic Rate for cash advances (including balance transfers) is .046547%, with a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 16.99%. 

13. 
Conditions Under Which Other Charges May Be Imposed. We may impose the following fees and charges on your Account: 

a. 
Annual Fee. There is no annual fee. 

b. 
Cash Advance Fee. The fee for a cash advance is the greater of 2.00% of the cash advance amount or $5.00. 

c. 
Late Fee. A late fee of $25 will be imposed when any payment is 15 days past due.. 

d. 
Miscellaneous Photocopying. If you request a copy of a sales draft or other document, we may charge your Account $5.00 per copy and $25.00 per hour for research. These charges cover the costs of locating, copying, and delivering the documents to you. If a request is related to a billing error and an error is found, we will reverse any photocopying charges. 




e.Overlimit Fee. A fee of $29 will be imposed in any Billing Cycle in which the outstand�ing balance (including unpaid FINANCE CHARGES) exceeds your credit limit at any time. 
f.

If you sign an application for this Account or sign or use any Card or PIN, or allow others to use the Card or PIN, you and they will have accepted this Agreement just as if you and they signed it, and you and they, jointly and severally, will be bound by the following terms and conditions which will govern this Account. 

2. 
You Promise to Pay. You promise to pay us in United States dollars, by cash, check or money order as provided in this Agreement, all such amounts, plus FINANCE CHARGES, which arise from use of the Card or Account by you or any other person, and to be jointly and severally liable with such a person, unless such other person does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and you received no bene.t from the use. This includes any loan requests for credit card purchases, payments to a third party, or for deposit to a deposit, share, or share draft account of yours, or any co-applicant at the Credit Union. You agree to pay advances requested by any co-applicant the same as if you asked for the loan and it was paid to you. 

3. 
Purchases and Cash Advances. You must sign the Card to use it. Once you have signed the Card, you can use it to buy or lease goods or services, wherever the Card is honored, up to the full amount of your credit line. You also may use your Account and Card to get cash advances from us or participating .nancial institutions. You may use your Card and Personal Identi.cation Number (�PIN�) to obtain cash advances at automated teller machines (�ATMs�) designated with the VISA or Plus System networks. The periodic statement will identify the merchant or .nancial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. We may impose a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request. 

4. 
Convenience Checks. If we approve, you may obtain advances under your Account by writing preprinted loan drafts (�convenience checks�) that we supply to you. Your use of conve�nience checks will be shown as credit advances on your periodic statement. We may not honor the convenience check if it is postdated, payment of the check will exceed your credit limit, a convenience check is signed by a person without authorized access, the amount of the check is less than the minimum required amount, your Account has been terminated or suspended, or any convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen.

5. 	
Rebate Program. You may earn a 1.00% cash rebate on your Account if you meet the following requirements: 

a. 
Cash Rebate on Net Purchases. You may earn a .50% cash rebate on net purchases (purchases less returns for credit) made during a rebate period in which the net purchases posted to your Account total $2,500 or more. Cash advance transactions, including convenience checks and balance transfers, do not qualify for the cash rebate. The cash rebate will be calculated on cumulative net purchases posted to your Account for the prior rebate period. To illustrate, let us assume that during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) your total net purchases equal $3,500. In this example, we would multiply $3,500 by .50%, which would equal a cash rebate of $17.50. 

b. 
Cash Rebate on Average Daily Balance. 	You may earn a .50% cash rebate on the average daily balance in your Account if you maintain an average daily balance of $4,000 during a rebate period. The cash rebate will be calculated each quarter based on the average daily balance in your Account for the prior rebate period. For example, if the average daily balance in your Account during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) was $5,800, we would multiply $5,800 by .50%; which would equal a cash rebate of $29.00. 




There are four rebate periods in each calendar year:January 1 through March 31,April 1 through June 30,July 1 through September 30,and October 1 through December 31.The cash rebate for the prior rebate period will be credited to your checking or savings account by the 15th day of the month following the end of the prior rebate period. The maximum cash rebate you can earn on your Account is $300 per quarter, inclusive of cash rebates for net purchases and average daily balances. Your Account must remain open and in good standing in order to receive the cash rebate. If at any time your Account is assessed a late fee, is closed or is in default, you will forfeit all cash rebates accrued through the calendar quarter in which your Account was closed, or the delinquency or default occurred. The terms and conditions of this rebate program may be changed or cancelled at any time and for any reason without notice. 
6. 
Minimum Periodic Payment. You agree that you will pay each month not less than the minimum payment on or before the scheduled due date. The minimum payment will be three percent (3.0%) of your outstanding balance or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the greater of any amount past due or any amount in excess of your credit line. 

7. 
Periodic Statements. If, at the end of any monthly periodic interval which we may determine the �Billing Cycle,� you have an outstanding undisputed debit or credit balance in your Account, or if there is any FINANCE CHARGE imposed with respect to your Account, we will send you a periodic statement regarding the Account for that Billing Cycle. The statement will show any purchases, cash advances, payments, and credits made to your Account during the Billing Cycle, as well as your �New Balance,� any FINANCE CHARGE, any late charge, or other charges. You may elect to receive your statement information electronically. Your statement also will identify the �Required Payment Due� you must make for that Billing Cycle and the date it is due. You may pay in full for all your purchases and cash advances each month or you may repay in monthly installments. You agree to retain for state�ment veri.cation copies of transaction slips resulting from each purchase, each advance, and other transaction on your Account. Unless you notify us of a billing error as described below, you accept your monthly statement as an accurate statement of your Account with us. 

8. 
Credit Line. This Agreement will constitute a revolving line of credit, and we will advise you of the amount of your credit line. That amount will be the maximum amount you may have outstanding at any one time. You agree not to attempt to obtain more credit than the amount of your credit line. However, if you temporarily exceed your credit line, you agree to pay any overlimit fees and repay the excess immediately, even if we have not yet billed you. Obtaining such credit does not increase your credit line. We retain the right to increase or decrease your credit line at any time for any reason. Any increase or reduction on the limit of your credit line will be shown on your monthly statement or by separate notice together with any changes in the applicable minimum monthly payments. The minimum credit limit is $5,000. 

9. 
Circumstances Under Which a FINANCE CHARGE Will Be Imposed. The total outstanding balance of purchases and cash advances in the Account on the closing date of a Billing Cycle, including any FINANCE CHARGE will be shown on the Periodic Statement for that billing cycle as the �New Balance.� 

a. 
Purchases. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the closing date. This �grace period� allows you to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases for a billing cycle. If you do not pay the entire New Balance within the grace period, your FINANCE CHARGE will accrue from the date of purchase. 

b. 
Cash Advances. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances from the date each cash advance is made. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid a periodic FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances. In addition, a cash advance fee (FINANCE CHARGE) equal to 2% of the cash advance (or $10.00, whichever is greater) will be applied to each cash advance. 



10. 
Method Used to Determine the Balance on Which the FINANCE CHARGE May Be Computed. We .gure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Account by applying the Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of purchases and cash advances for your Account (not including current transactions). To get the �Average Daily Balance� we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid FINANCE CHARGES and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the �Average Daily Balance.� 

11. 
Method of Determining the Amount of the FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE imposed on purchases and cash advances with respect to a Billing Cycle, will be determined by multi�plying the Average Daily Balance of purchases and cash advances by the number of days in the Billing Cycle and then by the rate disclosed in the next paragraph. The FINANCE CHARGE for any Billing Cycle will be the sum of the FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and the FINANCE CHARGE for cash advances. However, the portion of your balance that is the result of purchases has a different treatment if you pay all of that portion by at least twenty .ve (25 days) after we send your billing statement. In 


that event, we will zero out the FINANCE CHARGE that would otherwise be charged on that portion of your account balance. For this purpose, payments will be applied .rst to unpaid FINANCE CHARGES, then to unpaid purchases and cash advances from prior billing statements (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate), then to purchases and cash advances during that Billing Cycle (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate). 
12. (a) Purchases. Periodic Rate and Corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The Periodic Rate that is used to compute the FINANCE CHARGE and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is variable, and will change based on changes in an index, which is the Prime Rate quoted on the 15th day of the last month of the prior quarter as published in The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition).We add a margin of 4.99 percentage points to the index to obtain the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE includes only interest and not other costs. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is divided by 365 to produce the daily Periodic Rate. The Periodic Rate and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that will apply to your Account will be disclosed on the notice that accompanies (and is a part of) this Agreement when you open your Account. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will in no event be higher than 18%, or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law, or fall below 5.99% over the life of the credit line. The rate will be adjusted on the twenty .rst day of each calendar quarter (January 21, April 21, July 21, and October 21). 
12. 
(b).Cash Advances. The Daily Periodic Rate for cash advances (including balance transfers) is .046547%, with a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 16.99%.

The words �we,��us,��our,� and �Lender� means iQ Credit Union. The word �Card� means any one or more credit cards issued under this Account.  If you sign an application for this Account or sign or use any Card or PIN, or allow others to use the Card or PIN, you and they will have accepted this Agreement just as if you and they signed it, and you and they, jointly and severally, will be bound by the following terms and conditions which will govern this Account. 

2. 
You Promise to Pay. You promise to pay us in United States dollars, by cash, check or money order as provided in this Agreement, all such amounts, plus FINANCE CHARGES, which arise from use of the Card or Account by you or any other person, and to be jointly and severally liable with such a person, unless such other person does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and you received no bene.t from the use. This includes any loan requests for credit card purchases, payments to a third party, or for deposit to a deposit, share, or share draft account of yours, or any co-applicant at the Credit Union. You agree to pay advances requested by any co-applicant the same as if you asked for the loan and it was paid to you. 

3. 
Purchases and Cash Advances. You must sign the Card to use it. Once you have signed the Card, you can use it to buy or lease goods or services, wherever the Card is honored, up to the full amount of your credit line. You also may use your Account and Card to get cash advances from us or participating .nancial institutions. You may use your Card and Personal Identi.cation Number (�PIN�) to obtain cash advances at automated teller machines (�ATMs�) designated with the VISA or Plus System networks. The periodic statement will identify the merchant or .nancial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. We may impose a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request. 

4. 
Convenience Checks. If we approve, you may obtain advances under your Account by writing preprinted loan drafts (�convenience checks�) that we supply to you. Your use of conve�nience checks will be shown as credit advances on your periodic statement. We may not honor the convenience check if it is postdated, payment of the check will exceed your credit limit, a convenience check is signed by a person without authorized access, the amount of the check is less than the minimum required amount, your Account has been terminated or suspended, or any convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen.

You understand there may be a charge for convenience check printing and charges for stop payment requests, returned items, check copies, and other fees or costs we incur in handling your convenience checks. Our liability for a wrongful dishonor is limited to your actual losses; however, a dishonor for the reasons stated above is not a wrongful dishonor. 

5. 	
Rebate Program. You may earn a 1.00% cash rebate on your Account if you meet the following requirements: 

a. 
Cash Rebate on Net Purchases. You may earn a .50% cash rebate on net purchases (purchases less returns for credit) made during a rebate period in which the net purchases posted to your Account total $2,500 or more. Cash advance transactions, including convenience checks and balance transfers, do not qualify for the cash rebate. The cash rebate will be calculated on cumulative net purchases posted to your Account for the prior rebate period. To illustrate, let us assume that during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) your total net purchases equal $3,500. In this example, we would multiply $3,500 by .50%, which would equal a cash rebate of $17.50. 

b. 
Cash Rebate on Average Daily Balance. 	You may earn a .50% cash rebate on the average daily balance in your Account if you maintain an average daily balance of $4,000 during a rebate period. The cash rebate will be calculated each quarter based on the average daily balance in your Account for the prior rebate period. For example, if the average daily balance in your Account during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) was $5,800, we would multiply $5,800 by .50%; which would equal a cash rebate of $29.00. 




There are four rebate periods in each calendar year:January 1 through March 31,April 1 through June 30,July 1 through September 30,and October 1 through December 31.The cash rebate for the prior rebate period will be credited to your checking or savings account by the 15th day of the month following the end of the prior rebate period. The maximum cash rebate you can earn on your Account is $300 per quarter, inclusive of cash rebates for net purchases and average daily balances. Your Account must remain open and in good standing in order to receive the cash rebate. If at any time your Account is assessed a late fee, is closed or is in default, you will forfeit all cash rebates accrued through the calendar quarter in which your Account was closed, or the delinquency or default occurred. The terms and conditions of this rebate program may be changed or cancelled at any time and for any reason without notice. 
6. 
Minimum Periodic Payment. You agree that you will pay each month not less than the minimum payment on or before the scheduled due date. The minimum payment will be three percent (3.0%) of your outstanding balance or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the greater of any amount past due or any amount in excess of your credit line. 

7. 
Periodic Statements. If, at the end of any monthly periodic interval which we may determine the �Billing Cycle,� you have an outstanding undisputed debit or credit balance in your Account, or if there is any FINANCE CHARGE imposed with respect to your Account, we will send you a periodic statement regarding the Account for that Billing Cycle. The statement will show any purchases, cash advances, payments, and credits made to your Account during the Billing Cycle, as well as your �New Balance,� any FINANCE CHARGE, any late charge, or other charges. You may elect to receive your statement information electronically. Your statement also will identify the �Required Payment Due� you must make for that Billing Cycle and the date it is due. You may pay in full for all your purchases and cash advances each month or you may repay in monthly installments. You agree to retain for state�ment veri.cation copies of transaction slips resulting from each purchase, each advance, and other transaction on your Account. Unless you notify us of a billing error as described below, you accept your monthly statement as an accurate statement of your Account with us. 

8. 
Credit Line. This Agreement will constitute a revolving line of credit, and we will advise you of the amount of your credit line. That amount will be the maximum amount you may have outstanding at any one time. You agree not to attempt to obtain more credit than the amount of your credit line. However, if you temporarily exceed your credit line, you agree to pay any overlimit fees and repay the excess immediately, even if we have not yet billed you. Obtaining such credit does not increase your credit line. We retain the right to increase or decrease your credit line at any time for any reason. Any increase or reduction on the limit of your credit line will be shown on your monthly statement or by separate notice together with any changes in the applicable minimum monthly payments. The minimum credit limit is $5,000. 

9. 
Circumstances Under Which a FINANCE CHARGE Will Be Imposed. The total outstanding balance of purchases and cash advances in the Account on the closing date of a Billing Cycle, including any FINANCE CHARGE will be shown on the Periodic Statement for that billing cycle as the �New Balance.� 

a. 
Purchases. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the closing date. This �grace period� allows you to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases for a billing cycle. If you do not pay the entire New Balance within the grace period, your FINANCE CHARGE will accrue from the date of purchase. 

b. 
Cash Advances. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances from the date each cash advance is made. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid a periodic FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances. In addition, a cash advance fee (FINANCE CHARGE) equal to 2% of the cash advance (or $10.00, whichever is greater) will be applied to each cash advance. 



10. 
Method Used to Determine the Balance on Which the FINANCE CHARGE May Be Computed. We .gure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Account by applying the Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of purchases and cash advances for your Account (not including current transactions). To get the �Average Daily Balance� we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid FINANCE CHARGES and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the �Average Daily Balance.� 

11. 
Method of Determining the Amount of the FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE imposed on purchases and cash advances with respect to a Billing Cycle, will be determined by multi�plying the Average Daily Balance of purchases and cash advances by the number of days in the Billing Cycle and then by the rate disclosed in the next paragraph. The FINANCE CHARGE for any Billing Cycle will be the sum of the FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and the FINANCE CHARGE for cash advances. However, the portion of your balance that is the result of purchases has a different treatment if you pay all of that portion by at least twenty .ve (25 days) after we send your billing statement. In 


that event, we will zero out the FINANCE CHARGE that would otherwise be charged on that portion of your account balance. For this purpose, payments will be applied .rst to unpaid FINANCE CHARGES, then to unpaid purchases and cash advances from prior billing statements (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate), then to purchases and cash advances during that Billing Cycle (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate). 
12. (a) Purchases. Periodic Rate and Corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The Periodic Rate that is used to compute the FINANCE CHARGE and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is variable, and will change based on changes in an index, which is the Prime Rate quoted on the 15th day of the last month of the prior quarter as published in The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition).We add a margin of 4.99 percentage points to the index to obtain the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE includes only interest and not other costs. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is divided by 365 to produce the daily Periodic Rate. The Periodic Rate and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that will apply to your Account will be disclosed on the notice that accompanies (and is a part of) this Agreement when you open your Account. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will in no event be higher than 18%, or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law, or fall below 5.99% over the life of the credit line. The rate will be adjusted on the twenty .rst day of each calendar quarter (January 21, April 21, July 21, and October 21). 
12. 
(b).Cash Advances. The Daily Periodic Rate for cash advances (including balance transfers) is .046547%, with a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 16.99%. 

13. 
Conditions Under Which Other Charges May Be Imposed. We may impose the following fees and charges on your Account: 

a.

In this Agreement the words �you,� �your,� �yours,� �applicant,� and �Bor�rowers� mean any person who signs the application for this Account, any joint obligor, guarantor, authorized user,or the person whose name is embossed on the Card. The words �we,��us,��our,� and �Lender� means iQ Credit Union. The word �Card� means any one or more credit cards issued under this Account.  If you sign an application for this Account or sign or use any Card or PIN, or allow others to use the Card or PIN, you and they will have accepted this Agreement just as if you and they signed it, and you and they, jointly and severally, will be bound by the following terms and conditions which will govern this Account. 

2. 
You Promise to Pay. You promise to pay us in United States dollars, by cash, check or money order as provided in this Agreement, all such amounts, plus FINANCE CHARGES, which arise from use of the Card or Account by you or any other person, and to be jointly and severally liable with such a person, unless such other person does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and you received no bene.t from the use. This includes any loan requests for credit card purchases, payments to a third party, or for deposit to a deposit, share, or share draft account of yours, or any co-applicant at the Credit Union. You agree to pay advances requested by any co-applicant the same as if you asked for the loan and it was paid to you. 

3. 
Purchases and Cash Advances. You must sign the Card to use it. Once you have signed the Card, you can use it to buy or lease goods or services, wherever the Card is honored, up to the full amount of your credit line. You also may use your Account and Card to get cash advances from us or participating .nancial institutions. You may use your Card and Personal Identi.cation Number (�PIN�) to obtain cash advances at automated teller machines (�ATMs�) designated with the VISA or Plus System networks. The periodic statement will identify the merchant or .nancial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. We may impose a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request. 

4. 
Convenience Checks. If we approve, you may obtain advances under your Account by writing preprinted loan drafts (�convenience checks�) that we supply to you. Your use of conve�nience checks will be shown as credit advances on your periodic statement. We may not honor the convenience check if it is postdated, payment of the check will exceed your credit limit, a convenience check is signed by a person without authorized access, the amount of the check is less than the minimum required amount, your Account has been terminated or suspended, or any convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen. You may stop payment on a convenience check if you provide us with the exact information describing the convenience check. If you give us incorrect information, we will not be responsible for failing to stop payment. You understand there may be a charge for convenience check printing and charges for stop payment requests, returned items, check copies, and other fees or costs we incur in handling your convenience checks. Our liability for a wrongful dishonor is limited to your actual losses; however, a dishonor for the reasons stated above is not a wrongful dishonor. 

5. 	
Rebate Program. You may earn a 1.00% cash rebate on your Account if you meet the following requirements: 

a. 
Cash Rebate on Net Purchases. You may earn a .50% cash rebate on net purchases (purchases less returns for credit) made during a rebate period in which the net purchases posted to your Account total $2,500 or more. Cash advance transactions, including convenience checks and balance transfers, do not qualify for the cash rebate. The cash rebate will be calculated on cumulative net purchases posted to your Account for the prior rebate period. To illustrate, let us assume that during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) your total net purchases equal $3,500. In this example, we would multiply $3,500 by .50%, which would equal a cash rebate of $17.50. 

b. 
Cash Rebate on Average Daily Balance. 	You may earn a .50% cash rebate on the average daily balance in your Account if you maintain an average daily balance of $4,000 during a rebate period. The cash rebate will be calculated each quarter based on the average daily balance in your Account for the prior rebate period. For example, if the average daily balance in your Account during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) was $5,800, we would multiply $5,800 by .50%; which would equal a cash rebate of $29.00. 




There are four rebate periods in each calendar year:January 1 through March 31,April 1 through June 30,July 1 through September 30,and October 1 through December 31.The cash rebate for the prior rebate period will be credited to your checking or savings account by the 15th day of the month following the end of the prior rebate period. The maximum cash rebate you can earn on your Account is $300 per quarter, inclusive of cash rebates for net purchases and average daily balances. Your Account must remain open and in good standing in order to receive the cash rebate. If at any time your Account is assessed a late fee, is closed or is in default, you will forfeit all cash rebates accrued through the calendar quarter in which your Account was closed, or the delinquency or default occurred. The terms and conditions of this rebate program may be changed or cancelled at any time and for any reason without notice. 
6. 
Minimum Periodic Payment. You agree that you will pay each month not less than the minimum payment on or before the scheduled due date. The minimum payment will be three percent (3.0%) of your outstanding balance or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the greater of any amount past due or any amount in excess of your credit line. 

7. 
Periodic Statements. If, at the end of any monthly periodic interval which we may determine the �Billing Cycle,� you have an outstanding undisputed debit or credit balance in your Account, or if there is any FINANCE CHARGE imposed with respect to your Account, we will send you a periodic statement regarding the Account for that Billing Cycle. The statement will show any purchases, cash advances, payments, and credits made to your Account during the Billing Cycle, as well as your �New Balance,� any FINANCE CHARGE, any late charge, or other charges. You may elect to receive your statement information electronically. Your statement also will identify the �Required Payment Due� you must make for that Billing Cycle and the date it is due. You may pay in full for all your purchases and cash advances each month or you may repay in monthly installments. You agree to retain for state�ment veri.cation copies of transaction slips resulting from each purchase, each advance, and other transaction on your Account. Unless you notify us of a billing error as described below, you accept your monthly statement as an accurate statement of your Account with us. 

8. 
Credit Line. This Agreement will constitute a revolving line of credit, and we will advise you of the amount of your credit line. That amount will be the maximum amount you may have outstanding at any one time. You agree not to attempt to obtain more credit than the amount of your credit line. However, if you temporarily exceed your credit line, you agree to pay any overlimit fees and repay the excess immediately, even if we have not yet billed you. Obtaining such credit does not increase your credit line. We retain the right to increase or decrease your credit line at any time for any reason. Any increase or reduction on the limit of your credit line will be shown on your monthly statement or by separate notice together with any changes in the applicable minimum monthly payments. The minimum credit limit is $5,000. 

9. 
Circumstances Under Which a FINANCE CHARGE Will Be Imposed. The total outstanding balance of purchases and cash advances in the Account on the closing date of a Billing Cycle, including any FINANCE CHARGE will be shown on the Periodic Statement for that billing cycle as the �New Balance.� 

a. 
Purchases. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the closing date. This �grace period� allows you to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases for a billing cycle. If you do not pay the entire New Balance within the grace period, your FINANCE CHARGE will accrue from the date of purchase. 

b. 
Cash Advances. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances from the date each cash advance is made. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid a periodic FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances. In addition, a cash advance fee (FINANCE CHARGE) equal to 2% of the cash advance (or $10.00, whichever is greater) will be applied to each cash advance. 



10. 
Method Used to Determine the Balance on Which the FINANCE CHARGE May Be Computed. We .gure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Account by applying the Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of purchases and cash advances for your Account (not including current transactions). To get the �Average Daily Balance� we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid FINANCE CHARGES and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the �Average Daily Balance.� 

11. 
Method of Determining the Amount of the FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE imposed on purchases and cash advances with respect to a Billing Cycle, will be determined by multi�plying the Average Daily Balance of purchases and cash advances by the number of days in the Billing Cycle and then by the rate disclosed in the next paragraph. The FINANCE CHARGE for any Billing Cycle will be the sum of the FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and the FINANCE CHARGE for cash advances. However, the portion of your balance that is the result of purchases has a different treatment if you pay all of that portion by at least twenty .ve (25 days) after we send your billing statement. In 


that event, we will zero out the FINANCE CHARGE that would otherwise be charged on that portion of your account balance. For this purpose, payments will be applied .rst to unpaid FINANCE CHARGES, then to unpaid purchases and cash advances from prior billing statements (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate), then to purchases and cash advances during that Billing Cycle (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate). 
12. (a) Purchases. Periodic Rate and Corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The Periodic Rate that is used to compute the FINANCE CHARGE and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is variable, and will change based on changes in an index, which is the Prime Rate quoted on the 15th day of the last month of the prior quarter as published in The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition).We add a margin of 4.99 percentage points to the index to obtain the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE includes only interest and not other costs. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is divided by 365 to produce the daily Periodic Rate. The Periodic Rate and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that will apply to your Account will be disclosed on the notice that accompanies (and is a part of) this Agreement when you open your Account. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will in no event be higher than 18%, or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law, or fall below 5.99% over the life of the credit line. The rate will be adjusted on the twenty .rst day of each calendar quarter (January 21, April 21, July 21, and October 21). 
12. 
(b).Cash Advances. The Daily Periodic Rate for cash advances (including balance transfers) is .046547%, with a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 16.99%. 

13.

Introduction. This Agreement covers this VISA Platinum Credit Card issued by iQ Credit Union (�Lender�). In this Agreement the words �you,� �your,� �yours,� �applicant,� and �Bor�rowers� mean any person who signs the application for this Account, any joint obligor, guarantor, authorized user,or the person whose name is embossed on the Card. The words �we,��us,��our,� and �Lender� means iQ Credit Union. The word �Card� means any one or more credit cards issued under this Account.  If you sign an application for this Account or sign or use any Card or PIN, or allow others to use the Card or PIN, you and they will have accepted this Agreement just as if you and they signed it, and you and they, jointly and severally, will be bound by the following terms and conditions which will govern this Account. 

2. 
You Promise to Pay. You promise to pay us in United States dollars, by cash, check or money order as provided in this Agreement, all such amounts, plus FINANCE CHARGES, which arise from use of the Card or Account by you or any other person, and to be jointly and severally liable with such a person, unless such other person does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and you received no bene.t from the use. This includes any loan requests for credit card purchases, payments to a third party, or for deposit to a deposit, share, or share draft account of yours, or any co-applicant at the Credit Union. You agree to pay advances requested by any co-applicant the same as if you asked for the loan and it was paid to you. 

3. 
Purchases and Cash Advances. You must sign the Card to use it. Once you have signed the Card, you can use it to buy or lease goods or services, wherever the Card is honored, up to the full amount of your credit line. You also may use your Account and Card to get cash advances from us or participating .nancial institutions. You may use your Card and Personal Identi.cation Number (�PIN�) to obtain cash advances at automated teller machines (�ATMs�) designated with the VISA or Plus System networks. The periodic statement will identify the merchant or .nancial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. We may impose a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request. 

4. 
Convenience Checks. If we approve, you may obtain advances under your Account by writing preprinted loan drafts (�convenience checks�) that we supply to you. Your use of conve�nience checks will be shown as credit advances on your periodic statement. We may not honor the convenience check if it is postdated, payment of the check will exceed your credit limit, a convenience check is signed by a person without authorized access, the amount of the check is less than the minimum required amount, your Account has been terminated or suspended, or any convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen. You may stop payment on a convenience check if you provide us with the exact information describing the convenience check. If you give us incorrect information, we will not be responsible for failing to stop payment. You understand there may be a charge for convenience check printing and charges for stop payment requests, returned items, check copies, and other fees or costs we incur in handling your convenience checks. Our liability for a wrongful dishonor is limited to your actual losses; however, a dishonor for the reasons stated above is not a wrongful dishonor. 

5. 	
Rebate Program. You may earn a 1.00% cash rebate on your Account if you meet the following requirements: 

a. 
Cash Rebate on Net Purchases. You may earn a .50% cash rebate on net purchases (purchases less returns for credit) made during a rebate period in which the net purchases posted to your Account total $2,500 or more. Cash advance transactions, including convenience checks and balance transfers, do not qualify for the cash rebate. The cash rebate will be calculated on cumulative net purchases posted to your Account for the prior rebate period. To illustrate, let us assume that during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) your total net purchases equal $3,500. In this example, we would multiply $3,500 by .50%, which would equal a cash rebate of $17.50. 

b. 
Cash Rebate on Average Daily Balance. 	You may earn a .50% cash rebate on the average daily balance in your Account if you maintain an average daily balance of $4,000 during a rebate period. The cash rebate will be calculated each quarter based on the average daily balance in your Account for the prior rebate period. For example, if the average daily balance in your Account during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) was $5,800, we would multiply $5,800 by .50%; which would equal a cash rebate of $29.00. 




There are four rebate periods in each calendar year:January 1 through March 31,April 1 through June 30,July 1 through September 30,and October 1 through December 31.The cash rebate for the prior rebate period will be credited to your checking or savings account by the 15th day of the month following the end of the prior rebate period. The maximum cash rebate you can earn on your Account is $300 per quarter, inclusive of cash rebates for net purchases and average daily balances. Your Account must remain open and in good standing in order to receive the cash rebate. If at any time your Account is assessed a late fee, is closed or is in default, you will forfeit all cash rebates accrued through the calendar quarter in which your Account was closed, or the delinquency or default occurred. The terms and conditions of this rebate program may be changed or cancelled at any time and for any reason without notice. 
6. 
Minimum Periodic Payment. You agree that you will pay each month not less than the minimum payment on or before the scheduled due date. The minimum payment will be three percent (3.0%) of your outstanding balance or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the greater of any amount past due or any amount in excess of your credit line. 

7. 
Periodic Statements. If, at the end of any monthly periodic interval which we may determine the �Billing Cycle,� you have an outstanding undisputed debit or credit balance in your Account, or if there is any FINANCE CHARGE imposed with respect to your Account, we will send you a periodic statement regarding the Account for that Billing Cycle. The statement will show any purchases, cash advances, payments, and credits made to your Account during the Billing Cycle, as well as your �New Balance,� any FINANCE CHARGE, any late charge, or other charges. You may elect to receive your statement information electronically. Your statement also will identify the �Required Payment Due� you must make for that Billing Cycle and the date it is due. You may pay in full for all your purchases and cash advances each month or you may repay in monthly installments. You agree to retain for state�ment veri.cation copies of transaction slips resulting from each purchase, each advance, and other transaction on your Account. Unless you notify us of a billing error as described below, you accept your monthly statement as an accurate statement of your Account with us. 

8. 
Credit Line. This Agreement will constitute a revolving line of credit, and we will advise you of the amount of your credit line. That amount will be the maximum amount you may have outstanding at any one time. You agree not to attempt to obtain more credit than the amount of your credit line. However, if you temporarily exceed your credit line, you agree to pay any overlimit fees and repay the excess immediately, even if we have not yet billed you. Obtaining such credit does not increase your credit line. We retain the right to increase or decrease your credit line at any time for any reason. Any increase or reduction on the limit of your credit line will be shown on your monthly statement or by separate notice together with any changes in the applicable minimum monthly payments. The minimum credit limit is $5,000. 

9. 
Circumstances Under Which a FINANCE CHARGE Will Be Imposed. The total outstanding balance of purchases and cash advances in the Account on the closing date of a Billing Cycle, including any FINANCE CHARGE will be shown on the Periodic Statement for that billing cycle as the �New Balance.� 

a. 
Purchases. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the closing date. This �grace period� allows you to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases for a billing cycle. If you do not pay the entire New Balance within the grace period, your FINANCE CHARGE will accrue from the date of purchase. 

b. 
Cash Advances. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances from the date each cash advance is made. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid a periodic FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances. In addition, a cash advance fee (FINANCE CHARGE) equal to 2% of the cash advance (or $10.00, whichever is greater) will be applied to each cash advance. 



10. 
Method Used to Determine the Balance on Which the FINANCE CHARGE May Be Computed. We .gure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Account by applying the Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of purchases and cash advances for your Account (not including current transactions). To get the �Average Daily Balance� we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid FINANCE CHARGES and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the �Average Daily Balance.� 

11. 
Method of Determining the Amount of the FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE imposed on purchases and cash advances with respect to a Billing Cycle, will be determined by multi�plying the Average Daily Balance of purchases and cash advances by the number of days in the Billing Cycle and then by the rate disclosed in the next paragraph. The FINANCE CHARGE for any Billing Cycle will be the sum of the FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and the FINANCE CHARGE for cash advances. However, the portion of your balance that is the result of purchases has a different treatment if you pay all of that portion by at least twenty .ve (25 days) after we send your billing statement. In 


that event, we will zero out the FINANCE CHARGE that would otherwise be charged on that portion of your account balance. For this purpose, payments will be applied .rst to unpaid FINANCE CHARGES, then to unpaid purchases and cash advances from prior billing statements (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate), then to purchases and cash advances during that Billing Cycle (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate). 
12. (a) Purchases. Periodic Rate and Corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The Periodic Rate that is used to compute the FINANCE CHARGE and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is variable, and will change based on changes in an index, which is the Prime Rate quoted on the 15th day of the last month of the prior quarter as published in The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition).We add a margin of 4.99 percentage points to the index to obtain the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE includes only interest and not other costs. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is divided by 365 to produce the daily Periodic Rate. The Periodic Rate and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that will apply to your Account will be disclosed on the notice that accompanies (and is a part of) this Agreement when you open your Account. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will in no event be higher than 18%, or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law, or fall below 5.99% over the life of the credit line. The rate will be adjusted on the twenty .rst day of each calendar quarter (January 21, April 21, July 21, and October 21). 
12. 
(b).Cash Advances. The Daily Periodic Rate for cash advances (including balance transfers) is .046547%, with a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 16.99%. 

13. 
Conditions Under Which Other Charges May Be Imposed. We may impose the following fees and charges on your Account: 

a. 
Annual Fee. There is no annual fee. 

b. 
Cash Advance Fee. The fee for a cash advance is the greater of 2.00% of the cash advance amount or $5.00. 

c. 
Late Fee. A late fee of $25 will be imposed when any payment is 15 days past due.. 

d. 
Miscellaneous Photocopying. If you request a copy of a sales draft or other document, we may charge your Account $5.00 per copy and $25.00 per hour for research. These charges cover the costs of locating, copying, and delivering the documents to you. If a request is related to a billing error and an error is found, we will reverse any photocopying charges. 




e.Overlimit Fee. A fee of $29 will be imposed in any Billing Cycle in which the outstand�ing balance (including unpaid FINANCE CHARGES) exceeds your credit limit at any time. 
f. 
Replacement Card Charge. 	A $5.00 charge per card will be imposed for each replacement card you request, regardless of the reason. 

g.

h.

i.

The words �we,��us,��our,� and �Lender� means iQ Credit Union. The word �Card� means any one or more credit cards issued under this Account.  If you sign an application for this Account or sign or use any Card or PIN, or allow others to use the Card or PIN, you and they will have accepted this Agreement just as if you and they signed it, and you and they, jointly and severally, will be bound by the following terms and conditions which will govern this Account. 

2. 
You Promise to Pay. You promise to pay us in United States dollars, by cash, check or money order as provided in this Agreement, all such amounts, plus FINANCE CHARGES, which arise from use of the Card or Account by you or any other person, and to be jointly and severally liable with such a person, unless such other person does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and you received no bene.t from the use. This includes any loan requests for credit card purchases, payments to a third party, or for deposit to a deposit, share, or share draft account of yours, or any co-applicant at the Credit Union. You agree to pay advances requested by any co-applicant the same as if you asked for the loan and it was paid to you. 

3. 
Purchases and Cash Advances. You must sign the Card to use it. Once you have signed the Card, you can use it to buy or lease goods or services, wherever the Card is honored, up to the full amount of your credit line. You also may use your Account and Card to get cash advances from us or participating .nancial institutions. You may use your Card and Personal Identi.cation Number (�PIN�) to obtain cash advances at automated teller machines (�ATMs�) designated with the VISA or Plus System networks. The periodic statement will identify the merchant or .nancial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. We may impose a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request. 

4. 
Convenience Checks. If we approve, you may obtain advances under your Account by writing preprinted loan drafts (�convenience checks�) that we supply to you. Your use of conve�nience checks will be shown as credit advances on your periodic statement. We may not honor the convenience check if it is postdated, payment of the check will exceed your credit limit, a convenience check is signed by a person without authorized access, the amount of the check is less than the minimum required amount, your Account has been terminated or suspended, or any convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen. You may stop payment on a convenience check if you provide us with the exact information describing the convenience check. If you give us incorrect information, we will not be responsible for failing to stop payment. You understand there may be a charge for convenience check printing and charges for stop payment requests, returned items, check copies, and other fees or costs we incur in handling your convenience checks. Our liability for a wrongful dishonor is limited to your actual losses; however, a dishonor for the reasons stated above is not a wrongful dishonor. 

5. 	
Rebate Program. You may earn a 1.00% cash rebate on your Account if you meet the following requirements: 

a. 
Cash Rebate on Net Purchases. You may earn a .50% cash rebate on net purchases (purchases less returns for credit) made during a rebate period in which the net purchases posted to your Account total $2,500 or more. Cash advance transactions, including convenience checks and balance transfers, do not qualify for the cash rebate. The cash rebate will be calculated on cumulative net purchases posted to your Account for the prior rebate period. To illustrate, let us assume that during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) your total net purchases equal $3,500. In this example, we would multiply $3,500 by .50%, which would equal a cash rebate of $17.50. 

b. 
Cash Rebate on Average Daily Balance. 	You may earn a .50% cash rebate on the average daily balance in your Account if you maintain an average daily balance of $4,000 during a rebate period. The cash rebate will be calculated each quarter based on the average daily balance in your Account for the prior rebate period. For example, if the average daily balance in your Account during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) was $5,800, we would multiply $5,800 by .50%; which would equal a cash rebate of $29.00. 




There are four rebate periods in each calendar year:January 1 through March 31,April 1 through June 30,July 1 through September 30,and October 1 through December 31.The cash rebate for the prior rebate period will be credited to your checking or savings account by the 15th day of the month following the end of the prior rebate period. The maximum cash rebate you can earn on your Account is $300 per quarter, inclusive of cash rebates for net purchases and average daily balances. Your Account must remain open and in good standing in order to receive the cash rebate. If at any time your Account is assessed a late fee, is closed or is in default, you will forfeit all cash rebates accrued through the calendar quarter in which your Account was closed, or the delinquency or default occurred. The terms and conditions of this rebate program may be changed or cancelled at any time and for any reason without notice. 
6. 
Minimum Periodic Payment. You agree that you will pay each month not less than the minimum payment on or before the scheduled due date. The minimum payment will be three percent (3.0%) of your outstanding balance or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the greater of any amount past due or any amount in excess of your credit line. 

7. 
Periodic Statements. If, at the end of any monthly periodic interval which we may determine the �Billing Cycle,� you have an outstanding undisputed debit or credit balance in your Account, or if there is any FINANCE CHARGE imposed with respect to your Account, we will send you a periodic statement regarding the Account for that Billing Cycle. The statement will show any purchases, cash advances, payments, and credits made to your Account during the Billing Cycle, as well as your �New Balance,� any FINANCE CHARGE, any late charge, or other charges. You may elect to receive your statement information electronically. Your statement also will identify the �Required Payment Due� you must make for that Billing Cycle and the date it is due. You may pay in full for all your purchases and cash advances each month or you may repay in monthly installments. You agree to retain for state�ment veri.cation copies of transaction slips resulting from each purchase, each advance, and other transaction on your Account. Unless you notify us of a billing error as described below, you accept your monthly statement as an accurate statement of your Account with us. 

8. 
Credit Line. This Agreement will constitute a revolving line of credit, and we will advise you of the amount of your credit line. That amount will be the maximum amount you may have outstanding at any one time. You agree not to attempt to obtain more credit than the amount of your credit line. However, if you temporarily exceed your credit line, you agree to pay any overlimit fees and repay the excess immediately, even if we have not yet billed you. Obtaining such credit does not increase your credit line. We retain the right to increase or decrease your credit line at any time for any reason. Any increase or reduction on the limit of your credit line will be shown on your monthly statement or by separate notice together with any changes in the applicable minimum monthly payments. The minimum credit limit is $5,000. 

9. 
Circumstances Under Which a FINANCE CHARGE Will Be Imposed. The total outstanding balance of purchases and cash advances in the Account on the closing date of a Billing Cycle, including any FINANCE CHARGE will be shown on the Periodic Statement for that billing cycle as the �New Balance.� 

a. 
Purchases. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the closing date. This �grace period� allows you to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases for a billing cycle. If you do not pay the entire New Balance within the grace period, your FINANCE CHARGE will accrue from the date of purchase. 

b. 
Cash Advances. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances from the date each cash advance is made. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid a periodic FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances. In addition, a cash advance fee (FINANCE CHARGE) equal to 2% of the cash advance (or $10.00, whichever is greater) will be applied to each cash advance. 



10. 
Method Used to Determine the Balance on Which the FINANCE CHARGE May Be Computed. We .gure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Account by applying the Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of purchases and cash advances for your Account (not including current transactions). To get the �Average Daily Balance� we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid FINANCE CHARGES and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the �Average Daily Balance.� 

11. 
Method of Determining the Amount of the FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE imposed on purchases and cash advances with respect to a Billing Cycle, will be determined by multi�plying the Average Daily Balance of purchases and cash advances by the number of days in the Billing Cycle and then by the rate disclosed in the next paragraph. The FINANCE CHARGE for any Billing Cycle will be the sum of the FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and the FINANCE CHARGE for cash advances. However, the portion of your balance that is the result of purchases has a different treatment if you pay all of that portion by at least twenty .ve (25 days) after we send your billing statement. In 


that event, we will zero out the FINANCE CHARGE that would otherwise be charged on that portion of your account balance. For this purpose, payments will be applied .rst to unpaid FINANCE CHARGES, then to unpaid purchases and cash advances from prior billing statements (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate), then to purchases and cash advances during that Billing Cycle (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate). 
12. (a) Purchases. Periodic Rate and Corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The Periodic Rate that is used to compute the FINANCE CHARGE and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is variable, and will change based on changes in an index, which is the Prime Rate quoted on the 15th day of the last month of the prior quarter as published in The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition).We add a margin of 4.99 percentage points to the index to obtain the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE includes only interest and not other costs. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is divided by 365 to produce the daily Periodic Rate. The Periodic Rate and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that will apply to your Account will be disclosed on the notice that accompanies (and is a part of) this Agreement when you open your Account. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will in no event be higher than 18%, or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law, or fall below 5.99% over the life of the credit line. The rate will be adjusted on the twenty .rst day of each calendar quarter (January 21, April 21, July 21, and October 21). 
12. 
(b).Cash Advances. The Daily Periodic Rate for cash advances (including balance transfers) is .046547%, with a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 16.99%. 

13. 
Conditions Under Which Other Charges May Be Imposed. We may impose the following fees and charges on your Account: 

a. 
Annual Fee. There is no annual fee. 

b.

If a request is related to a billing error and an error is found, we will reverse any photocopying charges. 




e.Overlimit Fee. A fee of $29 will be imposed in any Billing Cycle in which the outstand�ing balance (including unpaid FINANCE CHARGES) exceeds your credit limit at any time. 
f.

We may impose a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request. 

4. 
Convenience Checks. If we approve, you may obtain advances under your Account by writing preprinted loan drafts (�convenience checks�) that we supply to you. Your use of conve�nience checks will be shown as credit advances on your periodic statement. We may not honor the convenience check if it is postdated, payment of the check will exceed your credit limit, a convenience check is signed by a person without authorized access, the amount of the check is less than the minimum required amount, your Account has been terminated or suspended, or any convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen. You may stop payment on a convenience check if you provide us with the exact information describing the convenience check. If you give us incorrect information, we will not be responsible for failing to stop payment. You understand there may be a charge for convenience check printing and charges for stop payment requests, returned items, check copies, and other fees or costs we incur in handling your convenience checks. Our liability for a wrongful dishonor is limited to your actual losses; however, a dishonor for the reasons stated above is not a wrongful dishonor. 

5. 	
Rebate Program. You may earn a 1.00% cash rebate on your Account if you meet the following requirements: 

a. 
Cash Rebate on Net Purchases. You may earn a .50% cash rebate on net purchases (purchases less returns for credit) made during a rebate period in which the net purchases posted to your Account total $2,500 or more. Cash advance transactions, including convenience checks and balance transfers, do not qualify for the cash rebate. The cash rebate will be calculated on cumulative net purchases posted to your Account for the prior rebate period. To illustrate, let us assume that during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) your total net purchases equal $3,500. In this example, we would multiply $3,500 by .50%, which would equal a cash rebate of $17.50. 

b. 
Cash Rebate on Average Daily Balance. 	You may earn a .50% cash rebate on the average daily balance in your Account if you maintain an average daily balance of $4,000 during a rebate period. The cash rebate will be calculated each quarter based on the average daily balance in your Account for the prior rebate period. For example, if the average daily balance in your Account during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) was $5,800, we would multiply $5,800 by .50%; which would equal a cash rebate of $29.00. 




There are four rebate periods in each calendar year:January 1 through March 31,April 1 through June 30,July 1 through September 30,and October 1 through December 31.The cash rebate for the prior rebate period will be credited to your checking or savings account by the 15th day of the month following the end of the prior rebate period. The maximum cash rebate you can earn on your Account is $300 per quarter, inclusive of cash rebates for net purchases and average daily balances. Your Account must remain open and in good standing in order to receive the cash rebate. If at any time your Account is assessed a late fee, is closed or is in default, you will forfeit all cash rebates accrued through the calendar quarter in which your Account was closed, or the delinquency or default occurred. The terms and conditions of this rebate program may be changed or cancelled at any time and for any reason without notice. 
6. 
Minimum Periodic Payment. You agree that you will pay each month not less than the minimum payment on or before the scheduled due date. The minimum payment will be three percent (3.0%) of your outstanding balance or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the greater of any amount past due or any amount in excess of your credit line. 

7. 
Periodic Statements. If, at the end of any monthly periodic interval which we may determine the �Billing Cycle,� you have an outstanding undisputed debit or credit balance in your Account, or if there is any FINANCE CHARGE imposed with respect to your Account, we will send you a periodic statement regarding the Account for that Billing Cycle. The statement will show any purchases, cash advances, payments, and credits made to your Account during the Billing Cycle, as well as your �New Balance,� any FINANCE CHARGE, any late charge, or other charges. You may elect to receive your statement information electronically. Your statement also will identify the �Required Payment Due� you must make for that Billing Cycle and the date it is due. You may pay in full for all your purchases and cash advances each month or you may repay in monthly installments. You agree to retain for state�ment veri.cation copies of transaction slips resulting from each purchase, each advance, and other transaction on your Account. Unless you notify us of a billing error as described below, you accept your monthly statement as an accurate statement of your Account with us. 

8. 
Credit Line. This Agreement will constitute a revolving line of credit, and we will advise you of the amount of your credit line. That amount will be the maximum amount you may have outstanding at any one time. You agree not to attempt to obtain more credit than the amount of your credit line. However, if you temporarily exceed your credit line, you agree to pay any overlimit fees and repay the excess immediately, even if we have not yet billed you. Obtaining such credit does not increase your credit line. We retain the right to increase or decrease your credit line at any time for any reason. Any increase or reduction on the limit of your credit line will be shown on your monthly statement or by separate notice together with any changes in the applicable minimum monthly payments. The minimum credit limit is $5,000. 

9. 
Circumstances Under Which a FINANCE CHARGE Will Be Imposed. The total outstanding balance of purchases and cash advances in the Account on the closing date of a Billing Cycle, including any FINANCE CHARGE will be shown on the Periodic Statement for that billing cycle as the �New Balance.� 

a. 
Purchases. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the closing date. This �grace period� allows you to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases for a billing cycle. If you do not pay the entire New Balance within the grace period, your FINANCE CHARGE will accrue from the date of purchase. 

b. 
Cash Advances. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances from the date each cash advance is made. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid a periodic FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances. In addition, a cash advance fee (FINANCE CHARGE) equal to 2% of the cash advance (or $10.00, whichever is greater) will be applied to each cash advance. 



10. 
Method Used to Determine the Balance on Which the FINANCE CHARGE May Be Computed. We .gure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Account by applying the Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of purchases and cash advances for your Account (not including current transactions). To get the �Average Daily Balance� we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid FINANCE CHARGES and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the �Average Daily Balance.� 

11. 
Method of Determining the Amount of the FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE imposed on purchases and cash advances with respect to a Billing Cycle, will be determined by multi�plying the Average Daily Balance of purchases and cash advances by the number of days in the Billing Cycle and then by the rate disclosed in the next paragraph. The FINANCE CHARGE for any Billing Cycle will be the sum of the FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and the FINANCE CHARGE for cash advances. However, the portion of your balance that is the result of purchases has a different treatment if you pay all of that portion by at least twenty .ve (25 days) after we send your billing statement. In 


that event, we will zero out the FINANCE CHARGE that would otherwise be charged on that portion of your account balance. For this purpose, payments will be applied .rst to unpaid FINANCE CHARGES, then to unpaid purchases and cash advances from prior billing statements (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate), then to purchases and cash advances during that Billing Cycle (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate). 
12. (a) Purchases. Periodic Rate and Corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The Periodic Rate that is used to compute the FINANCE CHARGE and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is variable, and will change based on changes in an index, which is the Prime Rate quoted on the 15th day of the last month of the prior quarter as published in The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition).We add a margin of 4.99 percentage points to the index to obtain the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE includes only interest and not other costs. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is divided by 365 to produce the daily Periodic Rate. The Periodic Rate and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that will apply to your Account will be disclosed on the notice that accompanies (and is a part of) this Agreement when you open your Account. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will in no event be higher than 18%, or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law, or fall below 5.99% over the life of the credit line. The rate will be adjusted on the twenty .rst day of each calendar quarter (January 21, April 21, July 21, and October 21). 
12. 
(b).Cash Advances. The Daily Periodic Rate for cash advances (including balance transfers) is .046547%, with a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 16.99%. 

13. 
Conditions Under Which Other Charges May Be Imposed. We may impose the following fees and charges on your Account: 

a. 
Annual Fee. There is no annual fee. 

b. 
Cash Advance Fee. The fee for a cash advance is the greater of 2.00% of the cash advance amount or $5.00. 

c.

d. 
Miscellaneous Photocopying. If you request a copy of a sales draft or other document, we may charge your Account $5.00 per copy and $25.00 per hour for research. These charges cover the costs of locating, copying, and delivering the documents to you. If a request is related to a billing error and an error is found, we will reverse any photocopying charges. 




e.Overlimit Fee. A fee of $29 will be imposed in any Billing Cycle in which the outstand�ing balance (including unpaid FINANCE CHARGES) exceeds your credit limit at any time.

2. 
You Promise to Pay. You promise to pay us in United States dollars, by cash, check or money order as provided in this Agreement, all such amounts, plus FINANCE CHARGES, which arise from use of the Card or Account by you or any other person, and to be jointly and severally liable with such a person, unless such other person does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and you received no bene.t from the use. This includes any loan requests for credit card purchases, payments to a third party, or for deposit to a deposit, share, or share draft account of yours, or any co-applicant at the Credit Union. You agree to pay advances requested by any co-applicant the same as if you asked for the loan and it was paid to you. 

3. 
Purchases and Cash Advances. You must sign the Card to use it. Once you have signed the Card, you can use it to buy or lease goods or services, wherever the Card is honored, up to the full amount of your credit line. You also may use your Account and Card to get cash advances from us or participating .nancial institutions. You may use your Card and Personal Identi.cation Number (�PIN�) to obtain cash advances at automated teller machines (�ATMs�) designated with the VISA or Plus System networks. The periodic statement will identify the merchant or .nancial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. We may impose a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request. 

4. 
Convenience Checks. If we approve, you may obtain advances under your Account by writing preprinted loan drafts (�convenience checks�) that we supply to you. Your use of conve�nience checks will be shown as credit advances on your periodic statement. We may not honor the convenience check if it is postdated, payment of the check will exceed your credit limit, a convenience check is signed by a person without authorized access, the amount of the check is less than the minimum required amount, your Account has been terminated or suspended, or any convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen.

5. 	
Rebate Program. You may earn a 1.00% cash rebate on your Account if you meet the following requirements: 

a. 
Cash Rebate on Net Purchases. You may earn a .50% cash rebate on net purchases (purchases less returns for credit) made during a rebate period in which the net purchases posted to your Account total $2,500 or more. Cash advance transactions, including convenience checks and balance transfers, do not qualify for the cash rebate. The cash rebate will be calculated on cumulative net purchases posted to your Account for the prior rebate period. To illustrate, let us assume that during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) your total net purchases equal $3,500. In this example, we would multiply $3,500 by .50%, which would equal a cash rebate of $17.50. 

b. 
Cash Rebate on Average Daily Balance. 	You may earn a .50% cash rebate on the average daily balance in your Account if you maintain an average daily balance of $4,000 during a rebate period. The cash rebate will be calculated each quarter based on the average daily balance in your Account for the prior rebate period. For example, if the average daily balance in your Account during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) was $5,800, we would multiply $5,800 by .50%; which would equal a cash rebate of $29.00. 




There are four rebate periods in each calendar year:January 1 through March 31,April 1 through June 30,July 1 through September 30,and October 1 through December 31.The cash rebate for the prior rebate period will be credited to your checking or savings account by the 15th day of the month following the end of the prior rebate period. The maximum cash rebate you can earn on your Account is $300 per quarter, inclusive of cash rebates for net purchases and average daily balances. Your Account must remain open and in good standing in order to receive the cash rebate. If at any time your Account is assessed a late fee, is closed or is in default, you will forfeit all cash rebates accrued through the calendar quarter in which your Account was closed, or the delinquency or default occurred. The terms and conditions of this rebate program may be changed or cancelled at any time and for any reason without notice. 
6. 
Minimum Periodic Payment. You agree that you will pay each month not less than the minimum payment on or before the scheduled due date. The minimum payment will be three percent (3.0%) of your outstanding balance or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the greater of any amount past due or any amount in excess of your credit line. 

7. 
Periodic Statements. If, at the end of any monthly periodic interval which we may determine the �Billing Cycle,� you have an outstanding undisputed debit or credit balance in your Account, or if there is any FINANCE CHARGE imposed with respect to your Account, we will send you a periodic statement regarding the Account for that Billing Cycle. The statement will show any purchases, cash advances, payments, and credits made to your Account during the Billing Cycle, as well as your �New Balance,� any FINANCE CHARGE, any late charge, or other charges.

Purchases. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the closing date. This �grace period� allows you to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases for a billing cycle. If you do not pay the entire New Balance within the grace period, your FINANCE CHARGE will accrue from the date of purchase. 

b. 
Cash Advances. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances from the date each cash advance is made. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid a periodic FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances. In addition, a cash advance fee (FINANCE CHARGE) equal to 2% of the cash advance (or $10.00, whichever is greater) will be applied to each cash advance. 



10. 
Method Used to Determine the Balance on Which the FINANCE CHARGE May Be Computed. We .gure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Account by applying the Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of purchases and cash advances for your Account (not including current transactions). To get the �Average Daily Balance� we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid FINANCE CHARGES and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the �Average Daily Balance.� 

11. 
Method of Determining the Amount of the FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE imposed on purchases and cash advances with respect to a Billing Cycle, will be determined by multi�plying the Average Daily Balance of purchases and cash advances by the number of days in the Billing Cycle and then by the rate disclosed in the next paragraph. The FINANCE CHARGE for any Billing Cycle will be the sum of the FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and the FINANCE CHARGE for cash advances. However, the portion of your balance that is the result of purchases has a different treatment if you pay all of that portion by at least twenty .ve (25 days) after we send your billing statement. In 


that event, we will zero out the FINANCE CHARGE that would otherwise be charged on that portion of your account balance. For this purpose, payments will be applied .rst to unpaid FINANCE CHARGES, then to unpaid purchases and cash advances from prior billing statements (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate), then to purchases and cash advances during that Billing Cycle (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate). 
12. (a) Purchases. Periodic Rate and Corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The Periodic Rate that is used to compute the FINANCE CHARGE and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is variable, and will change based on changes in an index, which is the Prime Rate quoted on the 15th day of the last month of the prior quarter as published in The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition).We add a margin of 4.99 percentage points to the index to obtain the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE includes only interest and not other costs. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is divided by 365 to produce the daily Periodic Rate. The Periodic Rate and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that will apply to your Account will be disclosed on the notice that accompanies (and is a part of) this Agreement when you open your Account. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will in no event be higher than 18%, or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law, or fall below 5.99% over the life of the credit line. The rate will be adjusted on the twenty .rst day of each calendar quarter (January 21, April 21, July 21, and October 21). 
12.

The words �we,��us,��our,� and �Lender� means iQ Credit Union. The word �Card� means any one or more credit cards issued under this Account.  If you sign an application for this Account or sign or use any Card or PIN, or allow others to use the Card or PIN, you and they will have accepted this Agreement just as if you and they signed it, and you and they, jointly and severally, will be bound by the following terms and conditions which will govern this Account. 

2. 
You Promise to Pay. You promise to pay us in United States dollars, by cash, check or money order as provided in this Agreement, all such amounts, plus FINANCE CHARGES, which arise from use of the Card or Account by you or any other person, and to be jointly and severally liable with such a person, unless such other person does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and you received no bene.t from the use. This includes any loan requests for credit card purchases, payments to a third party, or for deposit to a deposit, share, or share draft account of yours, or any co-applicant at the Credit Union. You agree to pay advances requested by any co-applicant the same as if you asked for the loan and it was paid to you. 

3. 
Purchases and Cash Advances. You must sign the Card to use it. Once you have signed the Card, you can use it to buy or lease goods or services, wherever the Card is honored, up to the full amount of your credit line. You also may use your Account and Card to get cash advances from us or participating .nancial institutions. You may use your Card and Personal Identi.cation Number (�PIN�) to obtain cash advances at automated teller machines (�ATMs�) designated with the VISA or Plus System networks. The periodic statement will identify the merchant or .nancial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. We may impose a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request. 

4. 
Convenience Checks. If we approve, you may obtain advances under your Account by writing preprinted loan drafts (�convenience checks�) that we supply to you. Your use of conve�nience checks will be shown as credit advances on your periodic statement. We may not honor the convenience check if it is postdated, payment of the check will exceed your credit limit, a convenience check is signed by a person without authorized access, the amount of the check is less than the minimum required amount, your Account has been terminated or suspended, or any convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen.

You understand there may be a charge for convenience check printing and charges for stop payment requests, returned items, check copies, and other fees or costs we incur in handling your convenience checks. Our liability for a wrongful dishonor is limited to your actual losses; however, a dishonor for the reasons stated above is not a wrongful dishonor. 

5. 	
Rebate Program. You may earn a 1.00% cash rebate on your Account if you meet the following requirements: 

a. 
Cash Rebate on Net Purchases. You may earn a .50% cash rebate on net purchases (purchases less returns for credit) made during a rebate period in which the net purchases posted to your Account total $2,500 or more. Cash advance transactions, including convenience checks and balance transfers, do not qualify for the cash rebate. The cash rebate will be calculated on cumulative net purchases posted to your Account for the prior rebate period. To illustrate, let us assume that during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) your total net purchases equal $3,500. In this example, we would multiply $3,500 by .50%, which would equal a cash rebate of $17.50. 

b. 
Cash Rebate on Average Daily Balance. 	You may earn a .50% cash rebate on the average daily balance in your Account if you maintain an average daily balance of $4,000 during a rebate period. The cash rebate will be calculated each quarter based on the average daily balance in your Account for the prior rebate period. For example, if the average daily balance in your Account during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) was $5,800, we would multiply $5,800 by .50%; which would equal a cash rebate of $29.00. 




There are four rebate periods in each calendar year:January 1 through March 31,April 1 through June 30,July 1 through September 30,and October 1 through December 31.The cash rebate for the prior rebate period will be credited to your checking or savings account by the 15th day of the month following the end of the prior rebate period. The maximum cash rebate you can earn on your Account is $300 per quarter, inclusive of cash rebates for net purchases and average daily balances. Your Account must remain open and in good standing in order to receive the cash rebate. If at any time your Account is assessed a late fee, is closed or is in default, you will forfeit all cash rebates accrued through the calendar quarter in which your Account was closed, or the delinquency or default occurred. The terms and conditions of this rebate program may be changed or cancelled at any time and for any reason without notice. 
6. 
Minimum Periodic Payment. You agree that you will pay each month not less than the minimum payment on or before the scheduled due date. The minimum payment will be three percent (3.0%) of your outstanding balance or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the greater of any amount past due or any amount in excess of your credit line. 

7. 
Periodic Statements. If, at the end of any monthly periodic interval which we may determine the �Billing Cycle,� you have an outstanding undisputed debit or credit balance in your Account, or if there is any FINANCE CHARGE imposed with respect to your Account, we will send you a periodic statement regarding the Account for that Billing Cycle. The statement will show any purchases, cash advances, payments, and credits made to your Account during the Billing Cycle, as well as your �New Balance,� any FINANCE CHARGE, any late charge, or other charges. You may elect to receive your statement information electronically. Your statement also will identify the �Required Payment Due� you must make for that Billing Cycle and the date it is due. You may pay in full for all your purchases and cash advances each month or you may repay in monthly installments. You agree to retain for state�ment veri.cation copies of transaction slips resulting from each purchase, each advance, and other transaction on your Account. Unless you notify us of a billing error as described below, you accept your monthly statement as an accurate statement of your Account with us. 

8. 
Credit Line. This Agreement will constitute a revolving line of credit, and we will advise you of the amount of your credit line. That amount will be the maximum amount you may have outstanding at any one time. You agree not to attempt to obtain more credit than the amount of your credit line. However, if you temporarily exceed your credit line, you agree to pay any overlimit fees and repay the excess immediately, even if we have not yet billed you. Obtaining such credit does not increase your credit line. We retain the right to increase or decrease your credit line at any time for any reason. Any increase or reduction on the limit of your credit line will be shown on your monthly statement or by separate notice together with any changes in the applicable minimum monthly payments. The minimum credit limit is $5,000. 

9. 
Circumstances Under Which a FINANCE CHARGE Will Be Imposed. The total outstanding balance of purchases and cash advances in the Account on the closing date of a Billing Cycle, including any FINANCE CHARGE will be shown on the Periodic Statement for that billing cycle as the �New Balance.� 

a. 
Purchases. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the closing date. This �grace period� allows you to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases for a billing cycle. If you do not pay the entire New Balance within the grace period, your FINANCE CHARGE will accrue from the date of purchase. 

b. 
Cash Advances. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances from the date each cash advance is made. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid a periodic FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances. In addition, a cash advance fee (FINANCE CHARGE) equal to 2% of the cash advance (or $10.00, whichever is greater) will be applied to each cash advance. 



10. 
Method Used to Determine the Balance on Which the FINANCE CHARGE May Be Computed. We .gure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Account by applying the Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of purchases and cash advances for your Account (not including current transactions). To get the �Average Daily Balance� we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid FINANCE CHARGES and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the �Average Daily Balance.� 

11. 
Method of Determining the Amount of the FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE imposed on purchases and cash advances with respect to a Billing Cycle, will be determined by multi�plying the Average Daily Balance of purchases and cash advances by the number of days in the Billing Cycle and then by the rate disclosed in the next paragraph. The FINANCE CHARGE for any Billing Cycle will be the sum of the FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and the FINANCE CHARGE for cash advances. However, the portion of your balance that is the result of purchases has a different treatment if you pay all of that portion by at least twenty .ve (25 days) after we send your billing statement. In 


that event, we will zero out the FINANCE CHARGE that would otherwise be charged on that portion of your account balance. For this purpose, payments will be applied .rst to unpaid FINANCE CHARGES, then to unpaid purchases and cash advances from prior billing statements (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate), then to purchases and cash advances during that Billing Cycle (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate). 
12. (a) Purchases. Periodic Rate and Corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The Periodic Rate that is used to compute the FINANCE CHARGE and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is variable, and will change based on changes in an index, which is the Prime Rate quoted on the 15th day of the last month of the prior quarter as published in The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition).We add a margin of 4.99 percentage points to the index to obtain the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE includes only interest and not other costs. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is divided by 365 to produce the daily Periodic Rate. The Periodic Rate and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that will apply to your Account will be disclosed on the notice that accompanies (and is a part of) this Agreement when you open your Account. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will in no event be higher than 18%, or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law, or fall below 5.99% over the life of the credit line. The rate will be adjusted on the twenty .rst day of each calendar quarter (January 21, April 21, July 21, and October 21). 
12. 
(b).Cash Advances. The Daily Periodic Rate for cash advances (including balance transfers) is .046547%, with a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 16.99%.

Cardholder, in the event more than one Card is enclosed bearing the same account number (""Account"").  The words ""CFE"" and/or ""Issuer"" refer to 
Central Florida Educators' Federal Credit Union.  This Agreement replaces all prior Agreements between Cardholder and CFE.

Before using your Card, please review this Agreement carefully.  By signing or using any Card that is enclosed with this document or that may be

Agreement at any time and for any reason.  CFE shall send you written notice thereof, mailed to you at your last known address.  Any changes in 
these terms, including, without limitation, changes in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) and the Periodic Rate, shall be effective with respect to 
any balances then outstanding to the extent allowable by law as well as to future Credit Purchases and Cash Advances.  For example, CFE may 
change the terms based on information in your credit report; APRs may change to higher APRs, fixed APRs may change to variable APRs, or variable 
APRs may change to fixed APRs. Any changes will be in accordance with your account agreement.

In the event you do not wish to comply with these terms and conditions for any reason, you understand that you may terminate this agreement and

Act (""Initial Disclosures"") and agrees that the terms contained in the initial Disclosures apply to Cardholder and Cardholder's use of the Card.

Using Your Credit Card Account: You may use your card to make purchases from entities that accept credit cards.  You may be required to provide 
card number security information to purchase goods or services via the Internet or telephone before your transaction is completed.  You may use 
your Card to obtain cash advances from CFE, other participating financial institutions, or an automated teller machine (ATM) authorized for such

Automated Teller Machine (ATM). There are risks of using a PIN at an ATM terminal that has been modified, has a suspicious device attached, may 
not be genuine, or is otherwise operating in a suspicious manner. Therefore, please tell us if you know of any problem with a facility. For instance, 
let us know if a light is not working or there is any damage to a facility. Report any suspicious activity or crimes to both the operator of the facility 
and the local law enforcement officials immediately. We want the ATM and night deposit facility to be safe and convenient for you.

Cardholder receives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally liable and agrees to pay for all Credit Purchases and Loans

number hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). In addition, you agree to pay all Finance Charges and other charges added to your Account

Card against damage, loss, theft or misuse and to maintain it at all times in a safe place. You will be responsible for any loss, claim or damage 
resulting from your failure to do so.

cash advances.  If your credit balance exceeds $1, you may request a refund by writing to us at:  CFE Federal Credit Union, Attn: Card Services, PO

payment on amounts previously drawn.  The credit limit will be determined by the Issuer, and will be drawn upon as you utilize the Account.  You 
agree not to use your Card or permit the use of your Account to obtain credit purchases or loans which will increase your credit card indebtedness to 
us to an amount in excess of the established limit. 

Statements and Notices: CFE will send you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union, at monthly intervals determined by us, a 
statement reflecting all Account activity for the prior period (""cycle""), including purchases, cash advances, fees, and payments.  Additional notices 
and information may be sent to you at any time.  Such statements, notices, and information will be sent to the most recent mailing address you have 
provided to the Credit Union.  Notice sent to any one authorized user on the Account will constitute notice sent to all authorized users.  Unless you 
notify us in writing within 60 days of the mailing of each statement, the statement will be deemed correct and accepted by you and all authorized 
users of the Account.  

Payment: You agree to pay at least the minimum required payment amount shown on your statement by the date shown on the statement or no 
later than twenty-five (25) days from the statement closing date, whichever is later.  You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum 
payment, or repay the Total New Balance in full at your option without penalty. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make 
at least the minimum payment each month your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The required MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 
will be the greater of:  a) $20 or b) 3% of the portion of the outstanding balance which does not exceed your credit limit, plus the entire portion of 
the outstanding balance in excess of your credit limit, plus any amount past due.  If the outstanding balance of your account is $20 or less, it will be 
payable in full.  CFE may accept checks marked ""Payment in Full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of our rights to collect the full 
balance of your account. Except where prohibited by law, satisfaction of your account balance for less than the New Balance requires written 
agreement signed by one of our authorized employees.

Payment Allocation:  Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and 
any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order from the highest APR based on the applicable APR in accordance with law. Any 
payments less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be applied at our discretion. You may no longer direct us how to apply your payment 
among your account types or on balances within your account types.

Default: You will be in default under any of the following circumstances:  1) if you fail to make any minimum payment or other payment required by 
the Issuer on or before the date it is due or if you attempt to in any way avoid payment of your obligations; 2) if you violate any portion of your 
responsibility or promise you made under this agreement; 3) if you file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, meaning you are unable to pay your 
obligations when they are due or if attachment or garnishment proceedings are instituted against you; 4) if you made any false or misleading 
statements in any credit application; 5) if you provided false identification or records in connection with any credit application or credit update; 6) in 
the event of your death; 7) if you incur charges for Purchases and Cash Advances which exceed the maximum authorized credit limit; and/or 8) if the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, believes your ability to repay what you owe may be substantially reduced due to an event either within or beyond your 
control. Failure by Issuer to assert any rights hereunder shall not waive such rights. 

When you are in default, the Issuer may demand immediate payment of your Account balance in full without giving you prior notice.  If immediate 
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying Finance Charges at the annual percentage rate established for this account by the Issuer, until 
the entire balance has been paid.  Any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe the Issuer.  

Security Interest: You agree that this account is secured by all share and deposit accounts that you have or may have with CFE and that 
collateral pledged for other loans you have with this credit union will also secure your obligation under this agreement. However, unless you 
expressly agree otherwise, your IRA's, household goods and primary dwelling will not secure your obligations under this agreement even if the 
Issuer has or later acquires a security interest in the household goods or a mortgage on the dwelling. This security interest shall continue as 
long as you have your credit card account even if there is no outstanding balance on your account from time to time. You agree that if you do not 
make your credit card account payments on time, or if the balance on your Account exceeds your credit limit, CFE may, without notice to you, take 
funds from one or more of your share accounts to apply to the payment of this Account, and interests and costs, if delinquent and/or over the 
credit limit.

Interest: Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the Finance Charge calculation method referred to in the 
Disclosure box. The rate of interest will be established by Issuer from time to time and will not exceed the maximum rate of 17.75% APR.  The current 
interest rate per annum is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) set forth in the Disclosure box below.

Variable Rate Information: Your APR will vary. The rate for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers is determined by Prime Rate (Wall 
Street Journal Index). The Wall Street Journal Index is published in the consumer rates table of the Wall Street Journal on the 15th of each month (or 
the next business day if not published on the 15th) effective with your billing statement the following month.

Termination of this Agreement: CFE may terminate this agreement under the following conditions: a) upon adverse re-evaluation of your credit 
worthiness; b) if you fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement; and/or c) at your option or our option, if we have good cause.  If your credit card 
Account is to be terminated by the Issuer, you will receive written notice of such termination as applicable by law; however, you understand and 
acknowledge that such termination will not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance, Finance Charge, and fees.  The Card(s) issued to 
you for this Account remain the property of the Issuer.   

Card Ownership and Surrender Rules: Each Card is the property of CFE is not transferable and must be surrendered upon demand. The card can 
be cancelled as well as repossessed by CFE or its designee, and the privileges revoked, at any time without prior notice.  If the card is cancelled or 
surrender is demanded by Issuer, or if you default in any payment due, or if you are bankrupt or insolvent, or any attachment or garnishment 
proceedings are initiated against you or your property, or in the event of your death, CFE may elect to declare all amounts then owed to be 
immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. 

Reapplication: A reapplication by you and approval by the Issuer may be required if: a) the credit limit is increased; or b) the terms of payment are 
extended beyond the terms of the original agreement.

Delinquent loans: You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if your loans with us become delinquent or past due, your credit card Account 
shall be revoked, unless we determine that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency.  Under such circumstances we reserve the 
right to approve your continued use of the credit card.

Enforcing obligations: You agree to pay all costs incurred by CFE in collecting your debt or in enforcing this agreement, including reasonable 
attorney's fees and also those costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post-judgment proceedings, except to the 
extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law.  Should the Issuer employ or engage the services of any entity to enforce any of your 
obligations relating to this agreement, or to protect its interests in any manner arising under this agreement, you agree to pay to CFE all reasonable 
costs or expenses incurred as a result. 

Communications: You agree that we, our agents or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone communications or electronic 
communications with you.  

Credit Review and Release of Information: CFE reserves the right to reinvestigate and reevaluate any information you provided on your credit 
application at anytime. In the course of doing so, we may ask you for additional information, request credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify 
your current credit standing. Effective February 1, 2011, due to federal regulations CFE is required to review your account not less 
frequently than once every six months to reassess your credit worthiness and adjust your APR accordingly, if necessary. You agree that 
we may release information to others, such as credit bureaus, regarding the status and history of your account. However, we are not obligated to 
release any such information to anyone unless required by law to do so.

the State of Florida and that the exclusive venue for any action or dispute shall be in the courts of Orange County, Florida.

as well as all applicable laws. If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and regulations of MasterCard 
International, the rules and regulations of MasterCard International shall control.

Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the 
consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge 
of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Cash advance fees are Finance Charges. Foreign transaction fees are not Finance 
Charges.          
    
Balance Computation Method: Average daily balance method (including current transactions). We figure the interest charge on your account by 
applying the periodic rate to the ""average daily balance"" of your account. To get the ""average daily balance"" we take the beginning balance of your 
account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other Finance Charges and] any payments or 
credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the 
billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance.""

Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Methods: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a Finance Charge for 
that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle's 
billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a Finance Charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your 
account. To avoid an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date of that statement. A Finance Charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first 
day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 

The Finance Charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the Finance Charge is computed by applying the 
monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding 
balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. 
Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This 
gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

Method of Computing Cash Advances: The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the 
AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number 
of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances any new Cash 
Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later and subtracting any payments as received 
and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charge.

Balance Transfers: Balance transfers must be transferred from any financial institution other than CFE. Balance transfers and cash advances may 
not be used to pay any CFE accounts. Balance transfers are treated as and considered cash advances on your account. Amounts transferred are 
subject to your available credit limit. We are not required to honor a balance transfer request that will cause you to exceed your available credit limit. 
We will not be responsible for late payment or non-payment to other card issuers. We are not responsible for fees that may be charged for cash 
advances performed at other financial institutions and ATMs owners. There is no grace period for balance transfers.
It may take up to three (3) weeks for other financials to post the balance transfer transaction. You should continue to make all required payments 
until you confirm that the balance transfer was posted to the other financial institution. We will not close your other accounts even if you transfer the 
entire balance. If you wish to close another account, you should contact the issuer directly. 

Balance transfers and cash advances do not qualify to earn bonus points on the MasterCard Platinum Cash and MasterCard Platinum Rewards 
accounts.

Other Fees May Apply to the Account: Additional charges, plus applicable taxes, may also be assessed on the account.  Such fees are added to 
the balance of the Account and will be notated on your statement.  Fees will not be included in any Finance Charge calculation. Use of the card 
constitutes your understanding of an agreement to the following Fee Schedule:

Late Payment Warning: If we do not receive your minimum payment by the date listed on your statement you may have to pay a late 
payment fee of $15 on balances less than $500 and $25* for balances over $499.  Your APR(s) may be increased up to the Penalty APR of 
17.75%.  *The late payment fee for balances over $499 will be based on the greater amount of $20 or 3% of the outstanding balance not to 
exceed $25.

Penalty APR: Each time your account becomes 60 days past due, the Penalty APR will apply to all account balances. Any 
Promotional or Introductory APR will end and the Penalty APR will begin on the first day of the billing period. After you have 
made all the required payments on time for six consecutive billing periods, the Annual Percentage Rate will be reduced to the 
regular account APR beginning the first day of your next billing period. The change to your Penalty APR applies to all existing 
and future balances on your account.

Returned Check or Rejected Payment: If you pay us electronically or by check and your financial institution does not honor 
the payment or check, a fee of $25 will apply.

Over-the-credit-limit: If at any time your account balance is over your credit limit a fee will not be charged.  

Special Services: CFE reserves the right to charge a fee for Special Services that you request, if such charges are not prohibited 
by law or regulation. No Finance Charge will be assessed on such additional charges.  For example, a $5 fee applies for each 
copy of a document that you request (except when the request is made in connection with the investigation of a billing error 
made by the Issuer).  You may be charged $5 if you order a replacement card. The fee for other Special Services, if applicable, 
will be disclosed to you prior to processing the request. Additionally, there will be a $20 per hour or $5 minimum research fee. 
No charge will be made in connection with any good faith assertion of a billing error on the account.

Liability for Unauthorized Use: If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of your credit card or related 
cards, you should write to us immediately at: PSCU Financial Services, Credit Card Security Department, PO Box 31281, Tampa, FL 33631-3281 or call 
us at (800) 449-7728. You may also contact us on the Web: www.pscufs.com. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you 
notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.

Unauthorized Use - MasterCard: You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your MasterCard credit card. If you believe that your card has 
been lost, stolen, or an unauthorized use has occurred, notify PSCU Financial Services - Credit Card Security Department immediately at 800-449-
7728. If you have exercised reasonable care in safeguarding your card from loss or theft, you have not reported two or more incidents of 
unauthorized use in the last 12 months, and if your account is in good standing, you will not be liable for any unauthorized purchases made with your 
card after you notify us. If you don't meet these conditions, or if the unauthorized use occurred at an ATM, your liability will not exceed $50.

Foreign Transactions and Currency Conversion: For MasterCard, if you effect a transaction with your MasterCard in a currency other 
than U.S. dollars, MasterCard International Incorporated will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard International 
will use its currency conversion procedure, which is disclosed to institutions that issue MasterCard cards. Currently the currency 
conversion rate used by MasterCard International to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars for such transactions is 
generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by MasterCard International for the processing cycle in 
which the transaction is processed, increased by an adjustment factor established from time to time by MasterCard International. The 
currency conversion rate used by MasterCard International on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been 
used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. You agree to pay the converted amount in U.S. dollars, plus any 
charge for conversion or processing that may be imposed by the Issuer, plus any charge that may be imposed for an international 
transaction, regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion. The 1% International Service Assessment fee applies to all 
international transactions regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion.

Protected Balances Due to Rate Increases: Protected balances are the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an 
increased annual percentage rate cannot be applied after the rate for that category of transactions has been increased.

Annual Fee: No annual fee applies to this credit card.

Illegal Use and Internet Gambling: You agree that all transactions that you initiate by use of your card are legal in the jurisdiction where you live 
and/or where the transaction occurred. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located, including the United States. Your 
card may only be used for legal transactions. Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not mean that internet gambling 
transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which you may be located. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions 
you initiate by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.



USA Patriot Act: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: When you open an account at 
CFE, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's 
license or other identifying documents.

Right To Reject Change In Terms: A member may reject a significant change in terms by calling (407) 896-9411 or (800) 771-9411, option 3 or by 
mailing us at: CFE Federal Credit Union, Attn: Card Services, PO Box 958471, Lake Mary, FL 32795-8471, but in doing so you will forego any credit 
availability for the account and the account will be terminated or suspended. The balance on the account is the balance at the end of the day on which 
credit availability is terminated or suspended. CFE will establish an amortization period required by law for the balance on the account beginning no 
earlier than the date on which CFE was notified of the rejection. The right to reject a change in terms does not apply if CFE has not received a 
member's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for that payment.

and the local law enforcement officials immediately. We want the ATM and night deposit facility to be safe and convenient for you.

Credit Limit: By using the card, you acknowledge that you applied for a credit card to use from time to time and which may be replenished by 
payment on amounts previously drawn.  The credit limit will be determined by the Issuer, and will be drawn upon as you utilize the Account.  You 
agree not to use your Card or permit the use of your Account to obtain credit purchases or loans which will increase your credit card indebtedness to 
us to an amount in excess of the established limit. 

Statements and Notices: CFE will send you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union, at monthly intervals determined by us, a 
statement reflecting all Account activity for the prior period (""cycle""), including purchases, cash advances, fees, and payments.  Additional notices 
and information may be sent to you at any time.  Such statements, notices, and information will be sent to the most recent mailing address you have 
provided to the Credit Union.  Notice sent to any one authorized user on the Account will constitute notice sent to all authorized users.  Unless you 
notify us in writing within 60 days of the mailing of each statement, the statement will be deemed correct and accepted by you and all authorized 
users of the Account.  

Payment: You agree to pay at least the minimum required payment amount shown on your statement by the date shown on the statement or no 
later than twenty-five (25) days from the statement closing date, whichever is later.  You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum 
payment, or repay the Total New Balance in full at your option without penalty. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make 
at least the minimum payment each month your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The required MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 
will be the greater of:  a) $20 or b) 3% of the portion of the outstanding balance which does not exceed your credit limit, plus the entire portion of 
the outstanding balance in excess of your credit limit, plus any amount past due.  If the outstanding balance of your account is $20 or less, it will be 
payable in full.  CFE may accept checks marked ""Payment in Full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of our rights to collect the full 
balance of your account. Except where prohibited by law, satisfaction of your account balance for less than the New Balance requires written 
agreement signed by one of our authorized employees.

Payment Allocation:  Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and 
any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order from the highest APR based on the applicable APR in accordance with law. Any 
payments less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be applied at our discretion. You may no longer direct us how to apply your payment 
among your account types or on balances within your account types.

Default: You will be in default under any of the following circumstances:  1) if you fail to make any minimum payment or other payment required by 
the Issuer on or before the date it is due or if you attempt to in any way avoid payment of your obligations; 2) if you violate any portion of your 
responsibility or promise you made under this agreement; 3) if you file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, meaning you are unable to pay your 
obligations when they are due or if attachment or garnishment proceedings are instituted against you; 4) if you made any false or misleading 
statements in any credit application; 5) if you provided false identification or records in connection with any credit application or credit update; 6) in 
the event of your death; 7) if you incur charges for Purchases and Cash Advances which exceed the maximum authorized credit limit; and/or 8) if the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, believes your ability to repay what you owe may be substantially reduced due to an event either within or beyond your 
control. Failure by Issuer to assert any rights hereunder shall not waive such rights. 

When you are in default, the Issuer may demand immediate payment of your Account balance in full without giving you prior notice.  If immediate 
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying Finance Charges at the annual percentage rate established for this account by the Issuer, until 
the entire balance has been paid.  Any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe the Issuer.  

Security Interest: You agree that this account is secured by all share and deposit accounts that you have or may have with CFE and that 
collateral pledged for other loans you have with this credit union will also secure your obligation under this agreement. However, unless you 
expressly agree otherwise, your IRA's, household goods and primary dwelling will not secure your obligations under this agreement even if the 
Issuer has or later acquires a security interest in the household goods or a mortgage on the dwelling. This security interest shall continue as 
long as you have your credit card account even if there is no outstanding balance on your account from time to time. You agree that if you do not 
make your credit card account payments on time, or if the balance on your Account exceeds your credit limit, CFE may, without notice to you, take 
funds from one or more of your share accounts to apply to the payment of this Account, and interests and costs, if delinquent and/or over the 
credit limit.

Interest: Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the Finance Charge calculation method referred to in the 
Disclosure box. The rate of interest will be established by Issuer from time to time and will not exceed the maximum rate of 17.75% APR.  The current 
interest rate per annum is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) set forth in the Disclosure box below.

Variable Rate Information: Your APR will vary. The rate for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers is determined by Prime Rate (Wall 
Street Journal Index). The Wall Street Journal Index is published in the consumer rates table of the Wall Street Journal on the 15th of each month (or 
the next business day if not published on the 15th) effective with your billing statement the following month.

Termination of this Agreement: CFE may terminate this agreement under the following conditions: a) upon adverse re-evaluation of your credit 
worthiness; b) if you fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement; and/or c) at your option or our option, if we have good cause.  If your credit card 
Account is to be terminated by the Issuer, you will receive written notice of such termination as applicable by law; however, you understand and 
acknowledge that such termination will not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance, Finance Charge, and fees.  The Card(s) issued to 
you for this Account remain the property of the Issuer.   

Card Ownership and Surrender Rules: Each Card is the property of CFE is not transferable and must be surrendered upon demand. The card can 
be cancelled as well as repossessed by CFE or its designee, and the privileges revoked, at any time without prior notice.  If the card is cancelled or 
surrender is demanded by Issuer, or if you default in any payment due, or if you are bankrupt or insolvent, or any attachment or garnishment 
proceedings are initiated against you or your property, or in the event of your death, CFE may elect to declare all amounts then owed to be 
immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. 

Reapplication: A reapplication by you and approval by the Issuer may be required if: a) the credit limit is increased; or b) the terms of payment are 
extended beyond the terms of the original agreement.

Delinquent loans: You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if your loans with us become delinquent or past due, your credit card Account 
shall be revoked, unless we determine that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency.  Under such circumstances we reserve the 
right to approve your continued use of the credit card.

Enforcing obligations: You agree to pay all costs incurred by CFE in collecting your debt or in enforcing this agreement, including reasonable 
attorney's fees and also those costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post-judgment proceedings, except to the 
extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law.  Should the Issuer employ or engage the services of any entity to enforce any of your 
obligations relating to this agreement, or to protect its interests in any manner arising under this agreement, you agree to pay to CFE all reasonable 
costs or expenses incurred as a result. 

Communications: You agree that we, our agents or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone communications or electronic 
communications with you.  

Credit Review and Release of Information: CFE reserves the right to reinvestigate and reevaluate any information you provided on your credit 
application at anytime. In the course of doing so, we may ask you for additional information, request credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify 
your current credit standing. Effective February 1, 2011, due to federal regulations CFE is required to review your account not less 
frequently than once every six months to reassess your credit worthiness and adjust your APR accordingly, if necessary. You agree that 
we may release information to others, such as credit bureaus, regarding the status and history of your account. However, we are not obligated to 
release any such information to anyone unless required by law to do so.

Laws of the State: Except to the extent that Federal law is applicable, the validity, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all matters 
arising out
of the issuance and use of the Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.  You understand and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of 
the State of Florida and that the exclusive venue for any action or dispute shall be in the courts of Orange County, Florida.

Final Agreement / No Waiver: This Disclosure and Agreement is the definitive agreement between you and the Issuer and may not be 
contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.  The Issuer can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

MasterCard Rules: You agree that your Account shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations of MasterCard International, as applicable, 
as well as all applicable laws. If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and regulations of MasterCard 
International, the rules and regulations of MasterCard International shall control.

Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the 
consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge 
of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Cash advance fees are Finance Charges. Foreign transaction fees are not Finance 
Charges.          
    
Balance Computation Method: Average daily balance method (including current transactions). We figure the interest charge on your account by 
applying the periodic rate to the ""average daily balance"" of your account. To get the ""average daily balance"" we take the beginning balance of your 
account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other Finance Charges and] any payments or 
credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the 
billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance.""

Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Methods: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a Finance Charge for 
that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle's 
billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a Finance Charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your 
account. To avoid an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date of that statement. A Finance Charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first 
day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 

The Finance Charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the Finance Charge is computed by applying the 
monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding 
balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. 
Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This 
gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

Method of Computing Cash Advances: The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the 
AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number 
of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances any new Cash 
Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later and subtracting any payments as received 
and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charge.

Balance Transfers: Balance transfers must be transferred from any financial institution other than CFE. Balance transfers and cash advances may 
not be used to pay any CFE accounts. Balance transfers are treated as and considered cash advances on your account. Amounts transferred are 
subject to your available credit limit. We are not required to honor a balance transfer request that will cause you to exceed your available credit limit. 
We will not be responsible for late payment or non-payment to other card issuers. We are not responsible for fees that may be charged for cash 
advances performed at other financial institutions and ATMs owners. There is no grace period for balance transfers.
It may take up to three (3) weeks for other financials to post the balance transfer transaction. You should continue to make all required payments 
until you confirm that the balance transfer was posted to the other financial institution. We will not close your other accounts even if you transfer the 
entire balance. If you wish to close another account, you should contact the issuer directly. 

Balance transfers and cash advances do not qualify to earn bonus points on the MasterCard Platinum Cash and MasterCard Platinum Rewards 
accounts.

Other Fees May Apply to the Account: Additional charges, plus applicable taxes, may also be assessed on the account.  Such fees are added to 
the balance of the Account and will be notated on your statement.  Fees will not be included in any Finance Charge calculation. Use of the card 
constitutes your understanding of an agreement to the following Fee Schedule:

Late Payment Warning: If we do not receive your minimum payment by the date listed on your statement you may have to pay a late 
payment fee of $15 on balances less than $500 and $25* for balances over $499.  Your APR(s) may be increased up to the Penalty APR of 
17.75%.  *The late payment fee for balances over $499 will be based on the greater amount of $20 or 3% of the outstanding balance not to 
exceed $25.

Penalty APR: Each time your account becomes 60 days past due, the Penalty APR will apply to all account balances. Any 
Promotional or Introductory APR will end and the Penalty APR will begin on the first day of the billing period. After you have 
made all the required payments on time for six consecutive billing periods, the Annual Percentage Rate will be reduced to the 
regular account APR beginning the first day of your next billing period. The change to your Penalty APR applies to all existing 
and future balances on your account.

Returned Check or Rejected Payment: If you pay us electronically or by check and your financial institution does not honor 
the payment or check, a fee of $25 will apply.

Over-the-credit-limit: If at any time your account balance is over your credit limit a fee will not be charged.  

Special Services: CFE reserves the right to charge a fee for Special Services that you request, if such charges are not prohibited 
by law or regulation. No Finance Charge will be assessed on such additional charges.  For example, a $5 fee applies for each 
copy of a document that you request (except when the request is made in connection with the investigation of a billing error 
made by the Issuer).  You may be charged $5 if you order a replacement card. The fee for other Special Services, if applicable, 
will be disclosed to you prior to processing the request. Additionally, there will be a $20 per hour or $5 minimum research fee. 
No charge will be made in connection with any good faith assertion of a billing error on the account.

Liability for Unauthorized Use: If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of your credit card or related 
cards, you should write to us immediately at: PSCU Financial Services, Credit Card Security Department, PO Box 31281, Tampa, FL 33631-3281 or call

notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.

Unauthorized Use - MasterCard: You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your MasterCard credit card. If you believe that your card has 
been lost, stolen, or an unauthorized use has occurred, notify PSCU Financial Services - Credit Card Security Department immediately at 800-449-
7728. If you have exercised reasonable care in safeguarding your card from loss or theft, you have not reported two or more incidents of 
unauthorized use in the last 12 months, and if your account is in good standing, you will not be liable for any unauthorized purchases made with your 
card after you notify us. If you don't meet these conditions, or if the unauthorized use occurred at an ATM, your liability will not exceed $50.

Foreign Transactions and Currency Conversion: For MasterCard, if you effect a transaction with your MasterCard in a currency other 
than U.S. dollars, MasterCard International Incorporated will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard International 
will use its currency conversion procedure, which is disclosed to institutions that issue MasterCard cards. Currently the currency 
conversion rate used by MasterCard International to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars for such transactions is 
generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by MasterCard International for the processing cycle in 
which the transaction is processed, increased by an adjustment factor established from time to time by MasterCard International. The 
currency conversion rate used by MasterCard International on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been 
used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. You agree to pay the converted amount in U.S. dollars, plus any 
charge for conversion or processing that may be imposed by the Issuer, plus any charge that may be imposed for an international 
transaction, regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion. The 1% International Service Assessment fee applies to all 
international transactions regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion.

Protected Balances Due to Rate Increases: Protected balances are the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an 
increased annual percentage rate cannot be applied after the rate for that category of transactions has been increased.

Annual Fee: No annual fee applies to this credit card.

Illegal Use and Internet Gambling: You agree that all transactions that you initiate by use of your card are legal in the jurisdiction where you live 
and/or where the transaction occurred. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located, including the United States. Your 
card may only be used for legal transactions. Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not mean that internet gambling 
transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which you may be located. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions 
you initiate by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.



USA Patriot Act: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: When you open an account at 
CFE, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's 
license or other identifying documents.

Right To Reject Change In Terms: A member may reject a significant change in terms by calling (407) 896-9411 or (800) 771-9411, option 3 or by 
mailing us at: CFE Federal Credit Union, Attn: Card Services, PO Box 958471, Lake Mary, FL 32795-8471, but in doing so you will forego any credit 
availability for the account and the account will be terminated or suspended. The balance on the account is the balance at the end of the day on which 
credit availability is terminated or suspended. CFE will establish an amortization period required by law for the balance on the account beginning no 
earlier than the date on which CFE was notified of the rejection. The right to reject a change in terms does not apply if CFE has not received a 
member's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for that payment.

Automated Teller Machine (ATM). There are risks of using a PIN at an ATM terminal that has been modified, has a suspicious device attached, may 
not be genuine, or is otherwise operating in a suspicious manner. Therefore, please tell us if you know of any problem with a facility. For instance, 
let us know if a light is not working or there is any damage to a facility. Report any suspicious activity or crimes to both the operator of the facility 
and the local law enforcement officials immediately. We want the ATM and night deposit facility to be safe and convenient for you.

resulting from your failure to do so.

Box 958471, Lake Mary, Florida  32795-8471, Phone: 407-896-9411, outside Orlando 1-800-771-9411, option 3.

Credit Limit: By using the card, you acknowledge that you applied for a credit card to use from time to time and which may be replenished by 
payment on amounts previously drawn.  The credit limit will be determined by the Issuer, and will be drawn upon as you utilize the Account.  You 
agree not to use your Card or permit the use of your Account to obtain credit purchases or loans which will increase your credit card indebtedness to 
us to an amount in excess of the established limit. 

Statements and Notices: CFE will send you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union, at monthly intervals determined by us, a 
statement reflecting all Account activity for the prior period (""cycle""), including purchases, cash advances, fees, and payments.  Additional notices 
and information may be sent to you at any time.  Such statements, notices, and information will be sent to the most recent mailing address you have 
provided to the Credit Union.  Notice sent to any one authorized user on the Account will constitute notice sent to all authorized users.  Unless you 
notify us in writing within 60 days of the mailing of each statement, the statement will be deemed correct and accepted by you and all authorized 
users of the Account.  

Payment: You agree to pay at least the minimum required payment amount shown on your statement by the date shown on the statement or no 
later than twenty-five (25) days from the statement closing date, whichever is later.  You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum 
payment, or repay the Total New Balance in full at your option without penalty. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make 
at least the minimum payment each month your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The required MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 
will be the greater of:  a) $20 or b) 3% of the portion of the outstanding balance which does not exceed your credit limit, plus the entire portion of 
the outstanding balance in excess of your credit limit, plus any amount past due.  If the outstanding balance of your account is $20 or less, it will be 
payable in full.  CFE may accept checks marked ""Payment in Full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of our rights to collect the full 
balance of your account. Except where prohibited by law, satisfaction of your account balance for less than the New Balance requires written 
agreement signed by one of our authorized employees.

Payment Allocation:  Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and 
any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order from the highest APR based on the applicable APR in accordance with law. Any 
payments less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be applied at our discretion. You may no longer direct us how to apply your payment 
among your account types or on balances within your account types.

Default: You will be in default under any of the following circumstances:  1) if you fail to make any minimum payment or other payment required by 
the Issuer on or before the date it is due or if you attempt to in any way avoid payment of your obligations; 2) if you violate any portion of your 
responsibility or promise you made under this agreement; 3) if you file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, meaning you are unable to pay your 
obligations when they are due or if attachment or garnishment proceedings are instituted against you; 4) if you made any false or misleading 
statements in any credit application; 5) if you provided false identification or records in connection with any credit application or credit update; 6) in 
the event of your death; 7) if you incur charges for Purchases and Cash Advances which exceed the maximum authorized credit limit; and/or 8) if the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, believes your ability to repay what you owe may be substantially reduced due to an event either within or beyond your 
control. Failure by Issuer to assert any rights hereunder shall not waive such rights. 

When you are in default, the Issuer may demand immediate payment of your Account balance in full without giving you prior notice.  If immediate 
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying Finance Charges at the annual percentage rate established for this account by the Issuer, until 
the entire balance has been paid.  Any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe the Issuer.  

Security Interest: You agree that this account is secured by all share and deposit accounts that you have or may have with CFE and that 
collateral pledged for other loans you have with this credit union will also secure your obligation under this agreement. However, unless you 
expressly agree otherwise, your IRA's, household goods and primary dwelling will not secure your obligations under this agreement even if the 
Issuer has or later acquires a security interest in the household goods or a mortgage on the dwelling. This security interest shall continue as 
long as you have your credit card account even if there is no outstanding balance on your account from time to time. You agree that if you do not 
make your credit card account payments on time, or if the balance on your Account exceeds your credit limit, CFE may, without notice to you, take 
funds from one or more of your share accounts to apply to the payment of this Account, and interests and costs, if delinquent and/or over the 
credit limit.

Interest: Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the Finance Charge calculation method referred to in the 
Disclosure box. The rate of interest will be established by Issuer from time to time and will not exceed the maximum rate of 17.75% APR.  The current 
interest rate per annum is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) set forth in the Disclosure box below.

Variable Rate Information: Your APR will vary. The rate for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers is determined by Prime Rate (Wall 
Street Journal Index). The Wall Street Journal Index is published in the consumer rates table of the Wall Street Journal on the 15th of each month (or 
the next business day if not published on the 15th) effective with your billing statement the following month.

Termination of this Agreement: CFE may terminate this agreement under the following conditions: a) upon adverse re-evaluation of your credit 
worthiness; b) if you fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement; and/or c) at your option or our option, if we have good cause.  If your credit card 
Account is to be terminated by the Issuer, you will receive written notice of such termination as applicable by law; however, you understand and 
acknowledge that such termination will not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance, Finance Charge, and fees.  The Card(s) issued to 
you for this Account remain the property of the Issuer.   

Card Ownership and Surrender Rules: Each Card is the property of CFE is not transferable and must be surrendered upon demand. The card can 
be cancelled as well as repossessed by CFE or its designee, and the privileges revoked, at any time without prior notice.  If the card is cancelled or 
surrender is demanded by Issuer, or if you default in any payment due, or if you are bankrupt or insolvent, or any attachment or garnishment 
proceedings are initiated against you or your property, or in the event of your death, CFE may elect to declare all amounts then owed to be 
immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. 

Reapplication: A reapplication by you and approval by the Issuer may be required if: a) the credit limit is increased; or b) the terms of payment are 
extended beyond the terms of the original agreement.

Delinquent loans: You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if your loans with us become delinquent or past due, your credit card Account 
shall be revoked, unless we determine that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency.  Under such circumstances we reserve the 
right to approve your continued use of the credit card.

Enforcing obligations: You agree to pay all costs incurred by CFE in collecting your debt or in enforcing this agreement, including reasonable 
attorney's fees and also those costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post-judgment proceedings, except to the 
extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law.  Should the Issuer employ or engage the services of any entity to enforce any of your 
obligations relating to this agreement, or to protect its interests in any manner arising under this agreement, you agree to pay to CFE all reasonable 
costs or expenses incurred as a result. 

Communications: You agree that we, our agents or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone communications or electronic 
communications with you.  

Credit Review and Release of Information: CFE reserves the right to reinvestigate and reevaluate any information you provided on your credit 
application at anytime. In the course of doing so, we may ask you for additional information, request credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify 
your current credit standing. Effective February 1, 2011, due to federal regulations CFE is required to review your account not less 
frequently than once every six months to reassess your credit worthiness and adjust your APR accordingly, if necessary. You agree that 
we may release information to others, such as credit bureaus, regarding the status and history of your account. However, we are not obligated to 
release any such information to anyone unless required by law to do so.

Laws of the State: Except to the extent that Federal law is applicable, the validity, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all matters 
arising out
of the issuance and use of the Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.  You understand and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of 
the State of Florida and that the exclusive venue for any action or dispute shall be in the courts of Orange County, Florida.

Final Agreement / No Waiver: This Disclosure and Agreement is the definitive agreement between you and the Issuer and may not be 
contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.  The Issuer can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

MasterCard Rules: You agree that your Account shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations of MasterCard International, as applicable, 
as well as all applicable laws. If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and regulations of MasterCard 
International, the rules and regulations of MasterCard International shall control.

Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the 
consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge 
of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Cash advance fees are Finance Charges. Foreign transaction fees are not Finance 
Charges.          
    
Balance Computation Method: Average daily balance method (including current transactions). We figure the interest charge on your account by 
applying the periodic rate to the ""average daily balance"" of your account. To get the ""average daily balance"" we take the beginning balance of your 
account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other Finance Charges and] any payments or 
credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the 
billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance.""

Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Methods: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a Finance Charge for 
that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle's 
billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a Finance Charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your 
account. To avoid an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date of that statement. A Finance Charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first 
day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 

The Finance Charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the Finance Charge is computed by applying the 
monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding 
balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. 
Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This 
gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

Method of Computing Cash Advances: The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the 
AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number 
of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances any new Cash 
Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later and subtracting any payments as received 
and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charge.

Balance Transfers: Balance transfers must be transferred from any financial institution other than CFE. Balance transfers and cash advances may 
not be used to pay any CFE accounts. Balance transfers are treated as and considered cash advances on your account. Amounts transferred are 
subject to your available credit limit. We are not required to honor a balance transfer request that will cause you to exceed your available credit limit. 
We will not be responsible for late payment or non-payment to other card issuers. We are not responsible for fees that may be charged for cash 
advances performed at other financial institutions and ATMs owners. There is no grace period for balance transfers.
It may take up to three (3) weeks for other financials to post the balance transfer transaction. You should continue to make all required payments 
until you confirm that the balance transfer was posted to the other financial institution. We will not close your other accounts even if you transfer the 
entire balance. If you wish to close another account, you should contact the issuer directly. 

Balance transfers and cash advances do not qualify to earn bonus points on the MasterCard Platinum Cash and MasterCard Platinum Rewards 
accounts.

Other Fees May Apply to the Account: Additional charges, plus applicable taxes, may also be assessed on the account.  Such fees are added to 
the balance of the Account and will be notated on your statement.  Fees will not be included in any Finance Charge calculation. Use of the card 
constitutes your understanding of an agreement to the following Fee Schedule:

Late Payment Warning: If we do not receive your minimum payment by the date listed on your statement you may have to pay a late 
payment fee of $15 on balances less than $500 and $25* for balances over $499.  Your APR(s) may be increased up to the Penalty APR of 
17.75%.  *The late payment fee for balances over $499 will be based on the greater amount of $20 or 3% of the outstanding balance not to 
exceed $25.

Penalty APR: Each time your account becomes 60 days past due, the Penalty APR will apply to all account balances. Any 
Promotional or Introductory APR will end and the Penalty APR will begin on the first day of the billing period. After you have 
made all the required payments on time for six consecutive billing periods, the Annual Percentage Rate will be reduced to the 
regular account APR beginning the first day of your next billing period. The change to your Penalty APR applies to all existing 
and future balances on your account.

Returned Check or Rejected Payment: If you pay us electronically or by check and your financial institution does not honor 
the payment or check, a fee of $25 will apply.

Over-the-credit-limit: If at any time your account balance is over your credit limit a fee will not be charged.  

Special Services: CFE reserves the right to charge a fee for Special Services that you request, if such charges are not prohibited 
by law or regulation. No Finance Charge will be assessed on such additional charges.  For example, a $5 fee applies for each 
copy of a document that you request (except when the request is made in connection with the investigation of a billing error 
made by the Issuer).  You may be charged $5 if you order a replacement card. The fee for other Special Services, if applicable, 
will be disclosed to you prior to processing the request. Additionally, there will be a $20 per hour or $5 minimum research fee. 
No charge will be made in connection with any good faith assertion of a billing error on the account.

Liability for Unauthorized Use: If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of your credit card or related 
cards, you should write to us immediately at: PSCU Financial Services, Credit Card Security Department, PO Box 31281, Tampa, FL 33631-3281 or call

notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.

Unauthorized Use - MasterCard: You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your MasterCard credit card. If you believe that your card has 
been lost, stolen, or an unauthorized use has occurred, notify PSCU Financial Services - Credit Card Security Department immediately at 800-449-
7728. If you have exercised reasonable care in safeguarding your card from loss or theft, you have not reported two or more incidents of 
unauthorized use in the last 12 months, and if your account is in good standing, you will not be liable for any unauthorized purchases made with your 
card after you notify us. If you don't meet these conditions, or if the unauthorized use occurred at an ATM, your liability will not exceed $50.

Foreign Transactions and Currency Conversion: For MasterCard, if you effect a transaction with your MasterCard in a currency other 
than U.S. dollars, MasterCard International Incorporated will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard International 
will use its currency conversion procedure, which is disclosed to institutions that issue MasterCard cards. Currently the currency 
conversion rate used by MasterCard International to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars for such transactions is 
generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by MasterCard International for the processing cycle in 
which the transaction is processed, increased by an adjustment factor established from time to time by MasterCard International. The 
currency conversion rate used by MasterCard International on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been 
used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. You agree to pay the converted amount in U.S. dollars, plus any 
charge for conversion or processing that may be imposed by the Issuer, plus any charge that may be imposed for an international 
transaction, regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion. The 1% International Service Assessment fee applies to all 
international transactions regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion.

Protected Balances Due to Rate Increases: Protected balances are the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an 
increased annual percentage rate cannot be applied after the rate for that category of transactions has been increased.

Annual Fee: No annual fee applies to this credit card.

Illegal Use and Internet Gambling: You agree that all transactions that you initiate by use of your card are legal in the jurisdiction where you live 
and/or where the transaction occurred. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located, including the United States. Your 
card may only be used for legal transactions. Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not mean that internet gambling 
transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which you may be located. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions 
you initiate by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.



USA Patriot Act: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: When you open an account at 
CFE, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's 
license or other identifying documents.

Right To Reject Change In Terms: A member may reject a significant change in terms by calling (407) 896-9411 or (800) 771-9411, option 3 or by 
mailing us at: CFE Federal Credit Union, Attn: Card Services, PO Box 958471, Lake Mary, FL 32795-8471, but in doing so you will forego any credit 
availability for the account and the account will be terminated or suspended. The balance on the account is the balance at the end of the day on which 
credit availability is terminated or suspended. CFE will establish an amortization period required by law for the balance on the account beginning no 
earlier than the date on which CFE was notified of the rejection. The right to reject a change in terms does not apply if CFE has not received a 
member's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for that payment.

Automated Teller Machine (ATM). There are risks of using a PIN at an ATM terminal that has been modified, has a suspicious device attached, may 
not be genuine, or is otherwise operating in a suspicious manner. Therefore, please tell us if you know of any problem with a facility. For instance, 
let us know if a light is not working or there is any damage to a facility. Report any suspicious activity or crimes to both the operator of the facility 
and the local law enforcement officials immediately. We want the ATM and night deposit facility to be safe and convenient for you.

payment on amounts previously drawn.  The credit limit will be determined by the Issuer, and will be drawn upon as you utilize the Account.  You 
agree not to use your Card or permit the use of your Account to obtain credit purchases or loans which will increase your credit card indebtedness to 
us to an amount in excess of the established limit. 

Statements and Notices: CFE will send you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union, at monthly intervals determined by us, a 
statement reflecting all Account activity for the prior period (""cycle""), including purchases, cash advances, fees, and payments.  Additional notices 
and information may be sent to you at any time.  Such statements, notices, and information will be sent to the most recent mailing address you have 
provided to the Credit Union.  Notice sent to any one authorized user on the Account will constitute notice sent to all authorized users.  Unless you 
notify us in writing within 60 days of the mailing of each statement, the statement will be deemed correct and accepted by you and all authorized 
users of the Account.  

Payment: You agree to pay at least the minimum required payment amount shown on your statement by the date shown on the statement or no 
later than twenty-five (25) days from the statement closing date, whichever is later.  You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum 
payment, or repay the Total New Balance in full at your option without penalty. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make 
at least the minimum payment each month your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The required MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 
will be the greater of:  a) $20 or b) 3% of the portion of the outstanding balance which does not exceed your credit limit, plus the entire portion of 
the outstanding balance in excess of your credit limit, plus any amount past due.  If the outstanding balance of your account is $20 or less, it will be 
payable in full.  CFE may accept checks marked ""Payment in Full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of our rights to collect the full 
balance of your account. Except where prohibited by law, satisfaction of your account balance for less than the New Balance requires written 
agreement signed by one of our authorized employees.

Payment Allocation:  Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and 
any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order from the highest APR based on the applicable APR in accordance with law. Any 
payments less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be applied at our discretion. You may no longer direct us how to apply your payment 
among your account types or on balances within your account types.

Default: You will be in default under any of the following circumstances:  1) if you fail to make any minimum payment or other payment required by 
the Issuer on or before the date it is due or if you attempt to in any way avoid payment of your obligations; 2) if you violate any portion of your 
responsibility or promise you made under this agreement; 3) if you file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, meaning you are unable to pay your 
obligations when they are due or if attachment or garnishment proceedings are instituted against you; 4) if you made any false or misleading 
statements in any credit application; 5) if you provided false identification or records in connection with any credit application or credit update; 6) in 
the event of your death; 7) if you incur charges for Purchases and Cash Advances which exceed the maximum authorized credit limit; and/or 8) if the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, believes your ability to repay what you owe may be substantially reduced due to an event either within or beyond your 
control. Failure by Issuer to assert any rights hereunder shall not waive such rights. 

When you are in default, the Issuer may demand immediate payment of your Account balance in full without giving you prior notice.  If immediate 
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying Finance Charges at the annual percentage rate established for this account by the Issuer, until 
the entire balance has been paid.  Any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe the Issuer.  

Security Interest: You agree that this account is secured by all share and deposit accounts that you have or may have with CFE and that 
collateral pledged for other loans you have with this credit union will also secure your obligation under this agreement. However, unless you 
expressly agree otherwise, your IRA's, household goods and primary dwelling will not secure your obligations under this agreement even if the 
Issuer has or later acquires a security interest in the household goods or a mortgage on the dwelling. This security interest shall continue as 
long as you have your credit card account even if there is no outstanding balance on your account from time to time. You agree that if you do not 
make your credit card account payments on time, or if the balance on your Account exceeds your credit limit, CFE may, without notice to you, take 
funds from one or more of your share accounts to apply to the payment of this Account, and interests and costs, if delinquent and/or over the 
credit limit.

Interest: Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the Finance Charge calculation method referred to in the 
Disclosure box. The rate of interest will be established by Issuer from time to time and will not exceed the maximum rate of 17.75% APR.  The current 
interest rate per annum is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) set forth in the Disclosure box below.

Variable Rate Information: Your APR will vary. The rate for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers is determined by Prime Rate (Wall 
Street Journal Index). The Wall Street Journal Index is published in the consumer rates table of the Wall Street Journal on the 15th of each month (or 
the next business day if not published on the 15th) effective with your billing statement the following month.

Termination of this Agreement: CFE may terminate this agreement under the following conditions: a) upon adverse re-evaluation of your credit 
worthiness; b) if you fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement; and/or c) at your option or our option, if we have good cause.  If your credit card 
Account is to be terminated by the Issuer, you will receive written notice of such termination as applicable by law; however, you understand and 
acknowledge that such termination will not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance, Finance Charge, and fees.  The Card(s) issued to 
you for this Account remain the property of the Issuer.   

Card Ownership and Surrender Rules: Each Card is the property of CFE is not transferable and must be surrendered upon demand. The card can 
be cancelled as well as repossessed by CFE or its designee, and the privileges revoked, at any time without prior notice.  If the card is cancelled or 
surrender is demanded by Issuer, or if you default in any payment due, or if you are bankrupt or insolvent, or any attachment or garnishment 
proceedings are initiated against you or your property, or in the event of your death, CFE may elect to declare all amounts then owed to be 
immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. 

Reapplication: A reapplication by you and approval by the Issuer may be required if: a) the credit limit is increased; or b) the terms of payment are 
extended beyond the terms of the original agreement.

Delinquent loans: You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if your loans with us become delinquent or past due, your credit card Account 
shall be revoked, unless we determine that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency.  Under such circumstances we reserve the 
right to approve your continued use of the credit card.

Enforcing obligations: You agree to pay all costs incurred by CFE in collecting your debt or in enforcing this agreement, including reasonable 
attorney's fees and also those costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post-judgment proceedings, except to the 
extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law.  Should the Issuer employ or engage the services of any entity to enforce any of your 
obligations relating to this agreement, or to protect its interests in any manner arising under this agreement, you agree to pay to CFE all reasonable 
costs or expenses incurred as a result. 

Communications: You agree that we, our agents or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone communications or electronic 
communications with you.  

Credit Review and Release of Information: CFE reserves the right to reinvestigate and reevaluate any information you provided on your credit 
application at anytime. In the course of doing so, we may ask you for additional information, request credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify 
your current credit standing. Effective February 1, 2011, due to federal regulations CFE is required to review your account not less 
frequently than once every six months to reassess your credit worthiness and adjust your APR accordingly, if necessary. You agree that 
we may release information to others, such as credit bureaus, regarding the status and history of your account. However, we are not obligated to 
release any such information to anyone unless required by law to do so.

Laws of the State: Except to the extent that Federal law is applicable, the validity, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all matters 
arising out
of the issuance and use of the Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.  You understand and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of 
the State of Florida and that the exclusive venue for any action or dispute shall be in the courts of Orange County, Florida.

Final Agreement / No Waiver: This Disclosure and Agreement is the definitive agreement between you and the Issuer and may not be 
contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.  The Issuer can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

MasterCard Rules: You agree that your Account shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations of MasterCard International, as applicable, 
as well as all applicable laws. If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and regulations of MasterCard 
International, the rules and regulations of MasterCard International shall control.

Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the 
consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge 
of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Cash advance fees are Finance Charges. Foreign transaction fees are not Finance 
Charges.          
    
Balance Computation Method: Average daily balance method (including current transactions). We figure the interest charge on your account by 
applying the periodic rate to the ""average daily balance"" of your account. To get the ""average daily balance"" we take the beginning balance of your 
account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other Finance Charges and] any payments or 
credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the 
billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance.""

Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Methods: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a Finance Charge for 
that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle's 
billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a Finance Charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your 
account. To avoid an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date of that statement. A Finance Charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first 
day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 

The Finance Charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the Finance Charge is computed by applying the 
monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding 
balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. 
Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This 
gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

Method of Computing Cash Advances: The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the 
AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number 
of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances any new Cash 
Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later and subtracting any payments as received 
and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charge.

Balance Transfers: Balance transfers must be transferred from any financial institution other than CFE. Balance transfers and cash advances may

advances performed at other financial institutions and ATMs owners. There is no grace period for balance transfers.

until you confirm that the balance transfer was posted to the other financial institution. We will not close your other accounts even if you transfer the 
entire balance. If you wish to close another account, you should contact the issuer directly.

the balance of the Account and will be notated on your statement.  Fees will not be included in any Finance Charge calculation. Use of the card 
constitutes your understanding of an agreement to the following Fee Schedule:

Late Payment Warning: If we do not receive your minimum payment by the date listed on your statement you may have to pay a late 
payment fee of $15 on balances less than $500 and $25* for balances over $499.  Your APR(s) may be increased up to the Penalty APR of 
17.75%.  *The late payment fee for balances over $499 will be based on the greater amount of $20 or 3% of the outstanding balance not to 
exceed $25.

Penalty APR: Each time your account becomes 60 days past due, the Penalty APR will apply to all account balances. Any 
Promotional or Introductory APR will end and the Penalty APR will begin on the first day of the billing period. After you have 
made all the required payments on time for six consecutive billing periods, the Annual Percentage Rate will be reduced to the 
regular account APR beginning the first day of your next billing period. The change to your Penalty APR applies to all existing 
and future balances on your account.

Returned Check or Rejected Payment: If you pay us electronically or by check and your financial institution does not honor 
the payment or check, a fee of $25 will apply.

Special Services: CFE reserves the right to charge a fee for Special Services that you request, if such charges are not prohibited 
by law or regulation. No Finance Charge will be assessed on such additional charges.  For example, a $5 fee applies for each 
copy of a document that you request (except when the request is made in connection with the investigation of a billing error 
made by the Issuer).  You may be charged $5 if you order a replacement card. The fee for other Special Services, if applicable, 
will be disclosed to you prior to processing the request. Additionally, there will be a $20 per hour or $5 minimum research fee.

card after you notify us. If you don't meet these conditions, or if the unauthorized use occurred at an ATM, your liability will not exceed $50.

Foreign Transactions and Currency Conversion: For MasterCard, if you effect a transaction with your MasterCard in a currency other 
than U.S. dollars, MasterCard International Incorporated will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard International 
will use its currency conversion procedure, which is disclosed to institutions that issue MasterCard cards. Currently the currency 
conversion rate used by MasterCard International to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars for such transactions is 
generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by MasterCard International for the processing cycle in 
which the transaction is processed, increased by an adjustment factor established from time to time by MasterCard International. The 
currency conversion rate used by MasterCard International on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been 
used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. You agree to pay the converted amount in U.S. dollars, plus any 
charge for conversion or processing that may be imposed by the Issuer, plus any charge that may be imposed for an international 
transaction, regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion. The 1% International Service Assessment fee applies to all 
international transactions regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion.

Protected Balances Due to Rate Increases: Protected balances are the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an 
increased annual percentage rate cannot be applied after the rate for that category of transactions has been increased.

Annual Fee: No annual fee applies to this credit card.

Illegal Use and Internet Gambling: You agree that all transactions that you initiate by use of your card are legal in the jurisdiction where you live 
and/or where the transaction occurred. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located, including the United States. Your 
card may only be used for legal transactions. Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not mean that internet gambling 
transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which you may be located. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions 
you initiate by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.



USA Patriot Act: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: When you open an account at 
CFE, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's 
license or other identifying documents.

us to an amount in excess of the established limit. 

Statements and Notices: CFE will send you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union, at monthly intervals determined by us, a 
statement reflecting all Account activity for the prior period (""cycle""), including purchases, cash advances, fees, and payments.  Additional notices

the outstanding balance in excess of your credit limit, plus any amount past due.  If the outstanding balance of your account is $20 or less, it will be

balance of your account. Except where prohibited by law, satisfaction of your account balance for less than the New Balance requires written 
agreement signed by one of our authorized employees.

Payment Allocation:  Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and 
any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order from the highest APR based on the applicable APR in accordance with law. Any 
payments less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be applied at our discretion. You may no longer direct us how to apply your payment 
among your account types or on balances within your account types.

Default: You will be in default under any of the following circumstances:  1) if you fail to make any minimum payment or other payment required by 
the Issuer on or before the date it is due or if you attempt to in any way avoid payment of your obligations; 2) if you violate any portion of your 
responsibility or promise you made under this agreement; 3) if you file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, meaning you are unable to pay your 
obligations when they are due or if attachment or garnishment proceedings are instituted against you; 4) if you made any false or misleading 
statements in any credit application; 5) if you provided false identification or records in connection with any credit application or credit update; 6) in 
the event of your death; 7) if you incur charges for Purchases and Cash Advances which exceed the maximum authorized credit limit; and/or 8) if the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, believes your ability to repay what you owe may be substantially reduced due to an event either within or beyond your 
control. Failure by Issuer to assert any rights hereunder shall not waive such rights. 

When you are in default, the Issuer may demand immediate payment of your Account balance in full without giving you prior notice.  If immediate 
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying Finance Charges at the annual percentage rate established for this account by the Issuer, until 
the entire balance has been paid.  Any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe the Issuer.  

Security Interest: You agree that this account is secured by all share and deposit accounts that you have or may have with CFE and that 
collateral pledged for other loans you have with this credit union will also secure your obligation under this agreement. However, unless you 
expressly agree otherwise, your IRA's, household goods and primary dwelling will not secure your obligations under this agreement even if the 
Issuer has or later acquires a security interest in the household goods or a mortgage on the dwelling. This security interest shall continue as 
long as you have your credit card account even if there is no outstanding balance on your account from time to time. You agree that if you do not 
make your credit card account payments on time, or if the balance on your Account exceeds your credit limit, CFE may, without notice to you, take 
funds from one or more of your share accounts to apply to the payment of this Account, and interests and costs, if delinquent and/or over the 
credit limit.

Interest: Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the Finance Charge calculation method referred to in the 
Disclosure box. The rate of interest will be established by Issuer from time to time and will not exceed the maximum rate of 17.75% APR.  The current 
interest rate per annum is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) set forth in the Disclosure box below.

Variable Rate Information: Your APR will vary. The rate for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers is determined by Prime Rate (Wall 
Street Journal Index). The Wall Street Journal Index is published in the consumer rates table of the Wall Street Journal on the 15th of each month (or 
the next business day if not published on the 15th) effective with your billing statement the following month.

Termination of this Agreement: CFE may terminate this agreement under the following conditions: a) upon adverse re-evaluation of your credit 
worthiness; b) if you fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement; and/or c) at your option or our option, if we have good cause.  If your credit card 
Account is to be terminated by the Issuer, you will receive written notice of such termination as applicable by law; however, you understand and 
acknowledge that such termination will not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance, Finance Charge, and fees.  The Card(s) issued to 
you for this Account remain the property of the Issuer.   

Card Ownership and Surrender Rules: Each Card is the property of CFE is not transferable and must be surrendered upon demand. The card can

proceedings are initiated against you or your property, or in the event of your death, CFE may elect to declare all amounts then owed to be 
immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. 

Reapplication: A reapplication by you and approval by the Issuer may be required if: a) the credit limit is increased; or b) the terms of payment are 
extended beyond the terms of the original agreement.

Delinquent loans: You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if your loans with us become delinquent or past due, your credit card Account 
shall be revoked, unless we determine that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency.  Under such circumstances we reserve the 
right to approve your continued use of the credit card.

Enforcing obligations: You agree to pay all costs incurred by CFE in collecting your debt or in enforcing this agreement, including reasonable 
attorney's fees and also those costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post-judgment proceedings, except to the 
extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law.  Should the Issuer employ or engage the services of any entity to enforce any of your 
obligations relating to this agreement, or to protect its interests in any manner arising under this agreement, you agree to pay to CFE all reasonable 
costs or expenses incurred as a result. 

Communications: You agree that we, our agents or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone communications or electronic 
communications with you.  

Credit Review and Release of Information: CFE reserves the right to reinvestigate and reevaluate any information you provided on your credit 
application at anytime. In the course of doing so, we may ask you for additional information, request credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify 
your current credit standing. Effective February 1, 2011, due to federal regulations CFE is required to review your account not less 
frequently than once every six months to reassess your credit worthiness and adjust your APR accordingly, if necessary. You agree that 
we may release information to others, such as credit bureaus, regarding the status and history of your account. However, we are not obligated to 
release any such information to anyone unless required by law to do so.

Laws of the State: Except to the extent that Federal law is applicable, the validity, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all matters 
arising out
of the issuance and use of the Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.  You understand and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of 
the State of Florida and that the exclusive venue for any action or dispute shall be in the courts of Orange County, Florida.

Final Agreement / No Waiver: This Disclosure and Agreement is the definitive agreement between you and the Issuer and may not be 
contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.  The Issuer can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

MasterCard Rules: You agree that your Account shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations of MasterCard International, as applicable, 
as well as all applicable laws. If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and regulations of MasterCard 
International, the rules and regulations of MasterCard International shall control.

Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the 
consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge 
of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Cash advance fees are Finance Charges. Foreign transaction fees are not Finance 
Charges.          
    
Balance Computation Method: Average daily balance method (including current transactions). We figure the interest charge on your account by 
applying the periodic rate to the ""average daily balance"" of your account. To get the ""average daily balance"" we take the beginning balance of your 
account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other Finance Charges and] any payments or 
credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the 
billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance.""

Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Methods: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a Finance Charge for 
that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle's 
billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a Finance Charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your 
account. To avoid an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date of that statement. A Finance Charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first 
day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 

The Finance Charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the Finance Charge is computed by applying the 
monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding 
balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. 
Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This 
gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

Method of Computing Cash Advances: The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the 
AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number 
of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances any new Cash 
Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later and subtracting any payments as received 
and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charge.

Balance Transfers: Balance transfers must be transferred from any financial institution other than CFE. Balance transfers and cash advances may 
not be used to pay any CFE accounts. Balance transfers are treated as and considered cash advances on your account. Amounts transferred are 
subject to your available credit limit. We are not required to honor a balance transfer request that will cause you to exceed your available credit limit. 
We will not be responsible for late payment or non-payment to other card issuers. We are not responsible for fees that may be charged for cash 
advances performed at other financial institutions and ATMs owners. There is no grace period for balance transfers.
It may take up to three (3) weeks for other financials to post the balance transfer transaction. You should continue to make all required payments 
until you confirm that the balance transfer was posted to the other financial institution. We will not close your other accounts even if you transfer the 
entire balance. If you wish to close another account, you should contact the issuer directly. 

Balance transfers and cash advances do not qualify to earn bonus points on the MasterCard Platinum Cash and MasterCard Platinum Rewards 
accounts.

Other Fees May Apply to the Account: Additional charges, plus applicable taxes, may also be assessed on the account.  Such fees are added to 
the balance of the Account and will be notated on your statement.  Fees will not be included in any Finance Charge calculation. Use of the card 
constitutes your understanding of an agreement to the following Fee Schedule:

Late Payment Warning: If we do not receive your minimum payment by the date listed on your statement you may have to pay a late 
payment fee of $15 on balances less than $500 and $25* for balances over $499.  Your APR(s) may be increased up to the Penalty APR of 
17.75%.  *The late payment fee for balances over $499 will be based on the greater amount of $20 or 3% of the outstanding balance not to 
exceed $25.

Penalty APR: Each time your account becomes 60 days past due, the Penalty APR will apply to all account balances. Any 
Promotional or Introductory APR will end and the Penalty APR will begin on the first day of the billing period. After you have 
made all the required payments on time for six consecutive billing periods, the Annual Percentage Rate will be reduced to the 
regular account APR beginning the first day of your next billing period. The change to your Penalty APR applies to all existing 
and future balances on your account.

Returned Check or Rejected Payment: If you pay us electronically or by check and your financial institution does not honor 
the payment or check, a fee of $25 will apply.

Over-the-credit-limit: If at any time your account balance is over your credit limit a fee will not be charged.  

Special Services: CFE reserves the right to charge a fee for Special Services that you request, if such charges are not prohibited 
by law or regulation. No Finance Charge will be assessed on such additional charges.  For example, a $5 fee applies for each 
copy of a document that you request (except when the request is made in connection with the investigation of a billing error 
made by the Issuer).  You may be charged $5 if you order a replacement card. The fee for other Special Services, if applicable, 
will be disclosed to you prior to processing the request. Additionally, there will be a $20 per hour or $5 minimum research fee. 
No charge will be made in connection with any good faith assertion of a billing error on the account.

cards, you should write to us immediately at: PSCU Financial Services, Credit Card Security Department, PO Box 31281, Tampa, FL 33631-3281 or call 
us at (800) 449-7728. You may also contact us on the Web: www.pscufs.com. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you 
notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.

Unauthorized Use - MasterCard: You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your MasterCard credit card. If you believe that your card has 
been lost, stolen, or an unauthorized use has occurred, notify PSCU Financial Services - Credit Card Security Department immediately at 800-449-
7728. If you have exercised reasonable care in safeguarding your card from loss or theft, you have not reported two or more incidents of 
unauthorized use in the last 12 months, and if your account is in good standing, you will not be liable for any unauthorized purchases made with your 
card after you notify us. If you don't meet these conditions, or if the unauthorized use occurred at an ATM, your liability will not exceed $50.

Foreign Transactions and Currency Conversion: For MasterCard, if you effect a transaction with your MasterCard in a currency other 
than U.S. dollars, MasterCard International Incorporated will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard International 
will use its currency conversion procedure, which is disclosed to institutions that issue MasterCard cards. Currently the currency 
conversion rate used by MasterCard International to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars for such transactions is 
generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by MasterCard International for the processing cycle in 
which the transaction is processed, increased by an adjustment factor established from time to time by MasterCard International. The 
currency conversion rate used by MasterCard International on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been 
used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. You agree to pay the converted amount in U.S. dollars, plus any 
charge for conversion or processing that may be imposed by the Issuer, plus any charge that may be imposed for an international 
transaction, regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion. The 1% International Service Assessment fee applies to all 
international transactions regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion.

Protected Balances Due to Rate Increases: Protected balances are the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an 
increased annual percentage rate cannot be applied after the rate for that category of transactions has been increased.

Annual Fee: No annual fee applies to this credit card.

Illegal Use and Internet Gambling: You agree that all transactions that you initiate by use of your card are legal in the jurisdiction where you live 
and/or where the transaction occurred. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located, including the United States. Your 
card may only be used for legal transactions. Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not mean that internet gambling 
transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which you may be located. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions 
you initiate by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.



USA Patriot Act: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: When you open an account at 
CFE, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's 
license or other identifying documents.

Right To Reject Change In Terms: A member may reject a significant change in terms by calling (407) 896-9411 or (800) 771-9411, option 3 or by 
mailing us at: CFE Federal Credit Union, Attn: Card Services, PO Box 958471, Lake Mary, FL 32795-8471, but in doing so you will forego any credit 
availability for the account and the account will be terminated or suspended. The balance on the account is the balance at the end of the day on which 
credit availability is terminated or suspended. CFE will establish an amortization period required by law for the balance on the account beginning no 
earlier than the date on which CFE was notified of the rejection. The right to reject a change in terms does not apply if CFE has not received a 
member's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for that payment.

Agreement at any time and for any reason.  CFE shall send you written notice thereof, mailed to you at your last known address.  Any changes in 
these terms, including, without limitation, changes in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) and the Periodic Rate, shall be effective with respect to

change the terms based on information in your credit report; APRs may change to higher APRs, fixed APRs may change to variable APRs, or variable 
APRs may change to fixed APRs. Any changes will be in accordance with your account agreement.

In the event you do not wish to comply with these terms and conditions for any reason, you understand that you may terminate this agreement and

Automated Teller Machine (ATM). There are risks of using a PIN at an ATM terminal that has been modified, has a suspicious device attached, may 
not be genuine, or is otherwise operating in a suspicious manner. Therefore, please tell us if you know of any problem with a facility. For instance, 
let us know if a light is not working or there is any damage to a facility. Report any suspicious activity or crimes to both the operator of the facility 
and the local law enforcement officials immediately. We want the ATM and night deposit facility to be safe and convenient for you.

number hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). In addition, you agree to pay all Finance Charges and other charges added to your Account

payment on amounts previously drawn.  The credit limit will be determined by the Issuer, and will be drawn upon as you utilize the Account.  You 
agree not to use your Card or permit the use of your Account to obtain credit purchases or loans which will increase your credit card indebtedness to 
us to an amount in excess of the established limit. 

Statements and Notices: CFE will send you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union, at monthly intervals determined by us, a 
statement reflecting all Account activity for the prior period (""cycle""), including purchases, cash advances, fees, and payments.  Additional notices 
and information may be sent to you at any time.  Such statements, notices, and information will be sent to the most recent mailing address you have 
provided to the Credit Union.  Notice sent to any one authorized user on the Account will constitute notice sent to all authorized users.  Unless you 
notify us in writing within 60 days of the mailing of each statement, the statement will be deemed correct and accepted by you and all authorized 
users of the Account.  

Payment: You agree to pay at least the minimum required payment amount shown on your statement by the date shown on the statement or no 
later than twenty-five (25) days from the statement closing date, whichever is later.  You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum 
payment, or repay the Total New Balance in full at your option without penalty. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make 
at least the minimum payment each month your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The required MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 
will be the greater of:  a) $20 or b) 3% of the portion of the outstanding balance which does not exceed your credit limit, plus the entire portion of 
the outstanding balance in excess of your credit limit, plus any amount past due.  If the outstanding balance of your account is $20 or less, it will be 
payable in full.  CFE may accept checks marked ""Payment in Full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of our rights to collect the full 
balance of your account. Except where prohibited by law, satisfaction of your account balance for less than the New Balance requires written 
agreement signed by one of our authorized employees.

Payment Allocation:  Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and 
any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order from the highest APR based on the applicable APR in accordance with law. Any 
payments less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be applied at our discretion. You may no longer direct us how to apply your payment 
among your account types or on balances within your account types.

Default: You will be in default under any of the following circumstances:  1) if you fail to make any minimum payment or other payment required by 
the Issuer on or before the date it is due or if you attempt to in any way avoid payment of your obligations; 2) if you violate any portion of your 
responsibility or promise you made under this agreement; 3) if you file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, meaning you are unable to pay your 
obligations when they are due or if attachment or garnishment proceedings are instituted against you; 4) if you made any false or misleading 
statements in any credit application; 5) if you provided false identification or records in connection with any credit application or credit update; 6) in 
the event of your death; 7) if you incur charges for Purchases and Cash Advances which exceed the maximum authorized credit limit; and/or 8) if the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, believes your ability to repay what you owe may be substantially reduced due to an event either within or beyond your 
control. Failure by Issuer to assert any rights hereunder shall not waive such rights. 

When you are in default, the Issuer may demand immediate payment of your Account balance in full without giving you prior notice.  If immediate 
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying Finance Charges at the annual percentage rate established for this account by the Issuer, until 
the entire balance has been paid.  Any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe the Issuer.  

Security Interest: You agree that this account is secured by all share and deposit accounts that you have or may have with CFE and that 
collateral pledged for other loans you have with this credit union will also secure your obligation under this agreement. However, unless you 
expressly agree otherwise, your IRA's, household goods and primary dwelling will not secure your obligations under this agreement even if the 
Issuer has or later acquires a security interest in the household goods or a mortgage on the dwelling. This security interest shall continue as 
long as you have your credit card account even if there is no outstanding balance on your account from time to time. You agree that if you do not 
make your credit card account payments on time, or if the balance on your Account exceeds your credit limit, CFE may, without notice to you, take 
funds from one or more of your share accounts to apply to the payment of this Account, and interests and costs, if delinquent and/or over the 
credit limit.

Interest: Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the Finance Charge calculation method referred to in the 
Disclosure box. The rate of interest will be established by Issuer from time to time and will not exceed the maximum rate of 17.75% APR.  The current 
interest rate per annum is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) set forth in the Disclosure box below.

Variable Rate Information: Your APR will vary. The rate for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers is determined by Prime Rate (Wall 
Street Journal Index). The Wall Street Journal Index is published in the consumer rates table of the Wall Street Journal on the 15th of each month (or 
the next business day if not published on the 15th) effective with your billing statement the following month.

Termination of this Agreement: CFE may terminate this agreement under the following conditions: a) upon adverse re-evaluation of your credit 
worthiness; b) if you fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement; and/or c) at your option or our option, if we have good cause.  If your credit card 
Account is to be terminated by the Issuer, you will receive written notice of such termination as applicable by law; however, you understand and 
acknowledge that such termination will not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance, Finance Charge, and fees.  The Card(s) issued to 
you for this Account remain the property of the Issuer.   

Card Ownership and Surrender Rules: Each Card is the property of CFE is not transferable and must be surrendered upon demand. The card can 
be cancelled as well as repossessed by CFE or its designee, and the privileges revoked, at any time without prior notice.  If the card is cancelled or 
surrender is demanded by Issuer, or if you default in any payment due, or if you are bankrupt or insolvent, or any attachment or garnishment 
proceedings are initiated against you or your property, or in the event of your death, CFE may elect to declare all amounts then owed to be 
immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. 

Reapplication: A reapplication by you and approval by the Issuer may be required if: a) the credit limit is increased; or b) the terms of payment are 
extended beyond the terms of the original agreement.

Delinquent loans: You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if your loans with us become delinquent or past due, your credit card Account 
shall be revoked, unless we determine that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency.  Under such circumstances we reserve the 
right to approve your continued use of the credit card.

Enforcing obligations: You agree to pay all costs incurred by CFE in collecting your debt or in enforcing this agreement, including reasonable 
attorney's fees and also those costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post-judgment proceedings, except to the 
extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law.  Should the Issuer employ or engage the services of any entity to enforce any of your 
obligations relating to this agreement, or to protect its interests in any manner arising under this agreement, you agree to pay to CFE all reasonable 
costs or expenses incurred as a result. 

Communications: You agree that we, our agents or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone communications or electronic 
communications with you.  

Credit Review and Release of Information: CFE reserves the right to reinvestigate and reevaluate any information you provided on your credit 
application at anytime. In the course of doing so, we may ask you for additional information, request credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify 
your current credit standing. Effective February 1, 2011, due to federal regulations CFE is required to review your account not less 
frequently than once every six months to reassess your credit worthiness and adjust your APR accordingly, if necessary. You agree that 
we may release information to others, such as credit bureaus, regarding the status and history of your account. However, we are not obligated to 
release any such information to anyone unless required by law to do so.

Laws of the State: Except to the extent that Federal law is applicable, the validity, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all matters 
arising out
of the issuance and use of the Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.  You understand and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of 
the State of Florida and that the exclusive venue for any action or dispute shall be in the courts of Orange County, Florida.

Final Agreement / No Waiver: This Disclosure and Agreement is the definitive agreement between you and the Issuer and may not be 
contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.  The Issuer can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

MasterCard Rules: You agree that your Account shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations of MasterCard International, as applicable, 
as well as all applicable laws. If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and regulations of MasterCard 
International, the rules and regulations of MasterCard International shall control.

Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the 
consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge 
of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Cash advance fees are Finance Charges. Foreign transaction fees are not Finance 
Charges.          
    
Balance Computation Method: Average daily balance method (including current transactions). We figure the interest charge on your account by 
applying the periodic rate to the ""average daily balance"" of your account. To get the ""average daily balance"" we take the beginning balance of your 
account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other Finance Charges and] any payments or 
credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the 
billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance.""

Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Methods: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a Finance Charge for 
that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle's 
billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a Finance Charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your 
account. To avoid an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date of that statement. A Finance Charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first 
day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 

The Finance Charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the Finance Charge is computed by applying the 
monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding 
balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. 
Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This 
gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

Method of Computing Cash Advances: The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the 
AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number 
of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances any new Cash 
Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later and subtracting any payments as received 
and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charge.

Balance Transfers: Balance transfers must be transferred from any financial institution other than CFE. Balance transfers and cash advances may 
not be used to pay any CFE accounts. Balance transfers are treated as and considered cash advances on your account. Amounts transferred are

Promotional or Introductory APR will end and the Penalty APR will begin on the first day of the billing period. After you have 
made all the required payments on time for six consecutive billing periods, the Annual Percentage Rate will be reduced to the 
regular account APR beginning the first day of your next billing period. The change to your Penalty APR applies to all existing 
and future balances on your account.

Returned Check or Rejected Payment: If you pay us electronically or by check and your financial institution does not honor 
the payment or check, a fee of $25 will apply.

Over-the-credit-limit: If at any time your account balance is over your credit limit a fee will not be charged.  

Special Services: CFE reserves the right to charge a fee for Special Services that you request, if such charges are not prohibited 
by law or regulation. No Finance Charge will be assessed on such additional charges.  For example, a $5 fee applies for each 
copy of a document that you request (except when the request is made in connection with the investigation of a billing error 
made by the Issuer).  You may be charged $5 if you order a replacement card. The fee for other Special Services, if applicable,

been lost, stolen, or an unauthorized use has occurred, notify PSCU Financial Services - Credit Card Security Department immediately at 800-449-

Foreign Transactions and Currency Conversion: For MasterCard, if you effect a transaction with your MasterCard in a currency other 
than U.S. dollars, MasterCard International Incorporated will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard International 
will use its currency conversion procedure, which is disclosed to institutions that issue MasterCard cards. Currently the currency 
conversion rate used by MasterCard International to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars for such transactions is 
generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by MasterCard International for the processing cycle in 
which the transaction is processed, increased by an adjustment factor established from time to time by MasterCard International. The 
currency conversion rate used by MasterCard International on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been 
used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. You agree to pay the converted amount in U.S. dollars, plus any 
charge for conversion or processing that may be imposed by the Issuer, plus any charge that may be imposed for an international 
transaction, regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion. The 1% International Service Assessment fee applies to all 
international transactions regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion.

Protected Balances Due to Rate Increases: Protected balances are the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an 
increased annual percentage rate cannot be applied after the rate for that category of transactions has been increased.

Annual Fee: No annual fee applies to this credit card.

Illegal Use and Internet Gambling: You agree that all transactions that you initiate by use of your card are legal in the jurisdiction where you live 
and/or where the transaction occurred. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located, including the United States. Your 
card may only be used for legal transactions. Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not mean that internet gambling 
transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which you may be located. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions 
you initiate by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.



USA Patriot Act: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: When you open an account at 
CFE, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's 
license or other identifying documents.

Right To Reject Change In Terms: A member may reject a significant change in terms by calling (407) 896-9411 or (800) 771-9411, option 3 or by 
mailing us at: CFE Federal Credit Union, Attn: Card Services, PO Box 958471, Lake Mary, FL 32795-8471, but in doing so you will forego any credit

credit availability is terminated or suspended. CFE will establish an amortization period required by law for the balance on the account beginning no

agree not to use your Card or permit the use of your Account to obtain credit purchases or loans which will increase your credit card indebtedness to 
us to an amount in excess of the established limit. 

Statements and Notices: CFE will send you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union, at monthly intervals determined by us, a 
statement reflecting all Account activity for the prior period (""cycle""), including purchases, cash advances, fees, and payments.  Additional notices

the outstanding balance in excess of your credit limit, plus any amount past due.  If the outstanding balance of your account is $20 or less, it will be 
payable in full.  CFE may accept checks marked ""Payment in Full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of our rights to collect the full 
balance of your account. Except where prohibited by law, satisfaction of your account balance for less than the New Balance requires written 
agreement signed by one of our authorized employees.

Payment Allocation:  Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and 
any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order from the highest APR based on the applicable APR in accordance with law. Any 
payments less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be applied at our discretion. You may no longer direct us how to apply your payment 
among your account types or on balances within your account types.

Default: You will be in default under any of the following circumstances:  1) if you fail to make any minimum payment or other payment required by 
the Issuer on or before the date it is due or if you attempt to in any way avoid payment of your obligations; 2) if you violate any portion of your 
responsibility or promise you made under this agreement; 3) if you file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, meaning you are unable to pay your 
obligations when they are due or if attachment or garnishment proceedings are instituted against you; 4) if you made any false or misleading 
statements in any credit application; 5) if you provided false identification or records in connection with any credit application or credit update; 6) in 
the event of your death; 7) if you incur charges for Purchases and Cash Advances which exceed the maximum authorized credit limit; and/or 8) if the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, believes your ability to repay what you owe may be substantially reduced due to an event either within or beyond your 
control. Failure by Issuer to assert any rights hereunder shall not waive such rights. 

When you are in default, the Issuer may demand immediate payment of your Account balance in full without giving you prior notice.  If immediate 
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying Finance Charges at the annual percentage rate established for this account by the Issuer, until 
the entire balance has been paid.  Any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe the Issuer.  

Security Interest: You agree that this account is secured by all share and deposit accounts that you have or may have with CFE and that 
collateral pledged for other loans you have with this credit union will also secure your obligation under this agreement. However, unless you 
expressly agree otherwise, your IRA's, household goods and primary dwelling will not secure your obligations under this agreement even if the 
Issuer has or later acquires a security interest in the household goods or a mortgage on the dwelling. This security interest shall continue as 
long as you have your credit card account even if there is no outstanding balance on your account from time to time. You agree that if you do not 
make your credit card account payments on time, or if the balance on your Account exceeds your credit limit, CFE may, without notice to you, take 
funds from one or more of your share accounts to apply to the payment of this Account, and interests and costs, if delinquent and/or over the 
credit limit.

Interest: Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the Finance Charge calculation method referred to in the 
Disclosure box. The rate of interest will be established by Issuer from time to time and will not exceed the maximum rate of 17.75% APR.  The current 
interest rate per annum is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) set forth in the Disclosure box below.

Variable Rate Information: Your APR will vary. The rate for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers is determined by Prime Rate (Wall 
Street Journal Index). The Wall Street Journal Index is published in the consumer rates table of the Wall Street Journal on the 15th of each month (or 
the next business day if not published on the 15th) effective with your billing statement the following month.

Termination of this Agreement: CFE may terminate this agreement under the following conditions: a) upon adverse re-evaluation of your credit 
worthiness; b) if you fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement; and/or c) at your option or our option, if we have good cause.  If your credit card 
Account is to be terminated by the Issuer, you will receive written notice of such termination as applicable by law; however, you understand and 
acknowledge that such termination will not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance, Finance Charge, and fees.  The Card(s) issued to 
you for this Account remain the property of the Issuer.

proceedings are initiated against you or your property, or in the event of your death, CFE may elect to declare all amounts then owed to be 
immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. 

Reapplication: A reapplication by you and approval by the Issuer may be required if: a) the credit limit is increased; or b) the terms of payment are 
extended beyond the terms of the original agreement.

Delinquent loans: You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if your loans with us become delinquent or past due, your credit card Account 
shall be revoked, unless we determine that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency.  Under such circumstances we reserve the 
right to approve your continued use of the credit card.

Enforcing obligations: You agree to pay all costs incurred by CFE in collecting your debt or in enforcing this agreement, including reasonable 
attorney's fees and also those costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post-judgment proceedings, except to the 
extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law.  Should the Issuer employ or engage the services of any entity to enforce any of your 
obligations relating to this agreement, or to protect its interests in any manner arising under this agreement, you agree to pay to CFE all reasonable 
costs or expenses incurred as a result. 

Communications: You agree that we, our agents or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone communications or electronic 
communications with you.  

Credit Review and Release of Information: CFE reserves the right to reinvestigate and reevaluate any information you provided on your credit 
application at anytime. In the course of doing so, we may ask you for additional information, request credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify 
your current credit standing. Effective February 1, 2011, due to federal regulations CFE is required to review your account not less 
frequently than once every six months to reassess your credit worthiness and adjust your APR accordingly, if necessary. You agree that 
we may release information to others, such as credit bureaus, regarding the status and history of your account. However, we are not obligated to 
release any such information to anyone unless required by law to do so.

arising out
of the issuance and use of the Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.  You understand and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of 
the State of Florida and that the exclusive venue for any action or dispute shall be in the courts of Orange County, Florida.

Final Agreement / No Waiver: This Disclosure and Agreement is the definitive agreement between you and the Issuer and may not be 
contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.  The Issuer can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

MasterCard Rules: You agree that your Account shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations of MasterCard International, as applicable, 
as well as all applicable laws. If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and regulations of MasterCard 
International, the rules and regulations of MasterCard International shall control.

Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the 
consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge 
of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Cash advance fees are Finance Charges. Foreign transaction fees are not Finance 
Charges.          
    
Balance Computation Method: Average daily balance method (including current transactions). We figure the interest charge on your account by 
applying the periodic rate to the ""average daily balance"" of your account. To get the ""average daily balance"" we take the beginning balance of your 
account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other Finance Charges and] any payments or 
credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the 
billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance.""

Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Methods: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a Finance Charge for 
that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle's 
billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a Finance Charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your 
account. To avoid an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date of that statement. A Finance Charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first 
day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 

The Finance Charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the Finance Charge is computed by applying the 
monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding 
balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. 
Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This 
gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

Method of Computing Cash Advances: The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the 
AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number 
of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances any new Cash 
Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later and subtracting any payments as received 
and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charge.

Balance Transfers: Balance transfers must be transferred from any financial institution other than CFE. Balance transfers and cash advances may 
not be used to pay any CFE accounts. Balance transfers are treated as and considered cash advances on your account. Amounts transferred are 
subject to your available credit limit. We are not required to honor a balance transfer request that will cause you to exceed your available credit limit. 
We will not be responsible for late payment or non-payment to other card issuers. We are not responsible for fees that may be charged for cash

Late Payment Warning: If we do not receive your minimum payment by the date listed on your statement you may have to pay a late

17.75%.  *The late payment fee for balances over $499 will be based on the greater amount of $20 or 3% of the outstanding balance not to 
exceed $25.

Penalty APR: Each time your account becomes 60 days past due, the Penalty APR will apply to all account balances. Any 
Promotional or Introductory APR will end and the Penalty APR will begin on the first day of the billing period. After you have 
made all the required payments on time for six consecutive billing periods, the Annual Percentage Rate will be reduced to the 
regular account APR beginning the first day of your next billing period. The change to your Penalty APR applies to all existing 
and future balances on your account.

Returned Check or Rejected Payment: If you pay us electronically or by check and your financial institution does not honor 
the payment or check, a fee of $25 will apply.

Over-the-credit-limit: If at any time your account balance is over your credit limit a fee will not be charged.  

Special Services: CFE reserves the right to charge a fee for Special Services that you request, if such charges are not prohibited 
by law or regulation. No Finance Charge will be assessed on such additional charges.  For example, a $5 fee applies for each 
copy of a document that you request (except when the request is made in connection with the investigation of a billing error 
made by the Issuer).  You may be charged $5 if you order a replacement card. The fee for other Special Services, if applicable, 
will be disclosed to you prior to processing the request. Additionally, there will be a $20 per hour or $5 minimum research fee.

us at (800) 449-7728. You may also contact us on the Web: www.pscufs.com. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you 
notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.

Unauthorized Use - MasterCard: You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your MasterCard credit card. If you believe that your card has 
been lost, stolen, or an unauthorized use has occurred, notify PSCU Financial Services - Credit Card Security Department immediately at 800-449-
7728. If you have exercised reasonable care in safeguarding your card from loss or theft, you have not reported two or more incidents of 
unauthorized use in the last 12 months, and if your account is in good standing, you will not be liable for any unauthorized purchases made with your 
card after you notify us. If you don't meet these conditions, or if the unauthorized use occurred at an ATM, your liability will not exceed $50.

Foreign Transactions and Currency Conversion: For MasterCard, if you effect a transaction with your MasterCard in a currency other 
than U.S. dollars, MasterCard International Incorporated will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard International 
will use its currency conversion procedure, which is disclosed to institutions that issue MasterCard cards. Currently the currency 
conversion rate used by MasterCard International to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars for such transactions is 
generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by MasterCard International for the processing cycle in 
which the transaction is processed, increased by an adjustment factor established from time to time by MasterCard International. The 
currency conversion rate used by MasterCard International on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been 
used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. You agree to pay the converted amount in U.S. dollars, plus any 
charge for conversion or processing that may be imposed by the Issuer, plus any charge that may be imposed for an international 
transaction, regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion. The 1% International Service Assessment fee applies to all 
international transactions regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion.

Protected Balances Due to Rate Increases: Protected balances are the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an 
increased annual percentage rate cannot be applied after the rate for that category of transactions has been increased.

Annual Fee: No annual fee applies to this credit card.

Illegal Use and Internet Gambling: You agree that all transactions that you initiate by use of your card are legal in the jurisdiction where you live 
and/or where the transaction occurred. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located, including the United States. Your 
card may only be used for legal transactions. Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not mean that internet gambling 
transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which you may be located. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions 
you initiate by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.



USA Patriot Act: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: When you open an account at 
CFE, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's 
license or other identifying documents.

Right To Reject Change In Terms: A member may reject a significant change in terms by calling (407) 896-9411 or (800) 771-9411, option 3 or by 
mailing us at: CFE Federal Credit Union, Attn: Card Services, PO Box 958471, Lake Mary, FL 32795-8471, but in doing so you will forego any credit 
availability for the account and the account will be terminated or suspended. The balance on the account is the balance at the end of the day on which 
credit availability is terminated or suspended. CFE will establish an amortization period required by law for the balance on the account beginning no

and the local law enforcement officials immediately. We want the ATM and night deposit facility to be safe and convenient for you.

payment on amounts previously drawn.  The credit limit will be determined by the Issuer, and will be drawn upon as you utilize the Account.  You 
agree not to use your Card or permit the use of your Account to obtain credit purchases or loans which will increase your credit card indebtedness to 
us to an amount in excess of the established limit. 

Statements and Notices: CFE will send you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union, at monthly intervals determined by us, a 
statement reflecting all Account activity for the prior period (""cycle""), including purchases, cash advances, fees, and payments.  Additional notices 
and information may be sent to you at any time.  Such statements, notices, and information will be sent to the most recent mailing address you have

the outstanding balance in excess of your credit limit, plus any amount past due.  If the outstanding balance of your account is $20 or less, it will be

balance of your account. Except where prohibited by law, satisfaction of your account balance for less than the New Balance requires written 
agreement signed by one of our authorized employees.

Payment Allocation:  Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and 
any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order from the highest APR based on the applicable APR in accordance with law. Any 
payments less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be applied at our discretion. You may no longer direct us how to apply your payment 
among your account types or on balances within your account types.

Default: You will be in default under any of the following circumstances:  1) if you fail to make any minimum payment or other payment required by 
the Issuer on or before the date it is due or if you attempt to in any way avoid payment of your obligations; 2) if you violate any portion of your 
responsibility or promise you made under this agreement; 3) if you file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, meaning you are unable to pay your 
obligations when they are due or if attachment or garnishment proceedings are instituted against you; 4) if you made any false or misleading 
statements in any credit application; 5) if you provided false identification or records in connection with any credit application or credit update; 6) in 
the event of your death; 7) if you incur charges for Purchases and Cash Advances which exceed the maximum authorized credit limit; and/or 8) if the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, believes your ability to repay what you owe may be substantially reduced due to an event either within or beyond your 
control. Failure by Issuer to assert any rights hereunder shall not waive such rights. 

When you are in default, the Issuer may demand immediate payment of your Account balance in full without giving you prior notice.  If immediate 
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying Finance Charges at the annual percentage rate established for this account by the Issuer, until 
the entire balance has been paid.  Any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe the Issuer.  

Security Interest: You agree that this account is secured by all share and deposit accounts that you have or may have with CFE and that 
collateral pledged for other loans you have with this credit union will also secure your obligation under this agreement. However, unless you 
expressly agree otherwise, your IRA's, household goods and primary dwelling will not secure your obligations under this agreement even if the 
Issuer has or later acquires a security interest in the household goods or a mortgage on the dwelling. This security interest shall continue as 
long as you have your credit card account even if there is no outstanding balance on your account from time to time. You agree that if you do not 
make your credit card account payments on time, or if the balance on your Account exceeds your credit limit, CFE may, without notice to you, take 
funds from one or more of your share accounts to apply to the payment of this Account, and interests and costs, if delinquent and/or over the 
credit limit.

Interest: Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the Finance Charge calculation method referred to in the 
Disclosure box. The rate of interest will be established by Issuer from time to time and will not exceed the maximum rate of 17.75% APR.  The current 
interest rate per annum is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) set forth in the Disclosure box below.

Variable Rate Information: Your APR will vary. The rate for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers is determined by Prime Rate (Wall 
Street Journal Index). The Wall Street Journal Index is published in the consumer rates table of the Wall Street Journal on the 15th of each month (or 
the next business day if not published on the 15th) effective with your billing statement the following month.

Termination of this Agreement: CFE may terminate this agreement under the following conditions: a) upon adverse re-evaluation of your credit 
worthiness; b) if you fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement; and/or c) at your option or our option, if we have good cause.  If your credit card 
Account is to be terminated by the Issuer, you will receive written notice of such termination as applicable by law; however, you understand and 
acknowledge that such termination will not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance, Finance Charge, and fees.  The Card(s) issued to 
you for this Account remain the property of the Issuer.

proceedings are initiated against you or your property, or in the event of your death, CFE may elect to declare all amounts then owed to be 
immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. 

Reapplication: A reapplication by you and approval by the Issuer may be required if: a) the credit limit is increased; or b) the terms of payment are 
extended beyond the terms of the original agreement.

Delinquent loans: You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if your loans with us become delinquent or past due, your credit card Account 
shall be revoked, unless we determine that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency.  Under such circumstances we reserve the 
right to approve your continued use of the credit card.

Enforcing obligations: You agree to pay all costs incurred by CFE in collecting your debt or in enforcing this agreement, including reasonable 
attorney's fees and also those costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post-judgment proceedings, except to the 
extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law.  Should the Issuer employ or engage the services of any entity to enforce any of your 
obligations relating to this agreement, or to protect its interests in any manner arising under this agreement, you agree to pay to CFE all reasonable 
costs or expenses incurred as a result. 

Communications: You agree that we, our agents or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone communications or electronic 
communications with you.  

Credit Review and Release of Information: CFE reserves the right to reinvestigate and reevaluate any information you provided on your credit 
application at anytime. In the course of doing so, we may ask you for additional information, request credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify 
your current credit standing. Effective February 1, 2011, due to federal regulations CFE is required to review your account not less 
frequently than once every six months to reassess your credit worthiness and adjust your APR accordingly, if necessary. You agree that 
we may release information to others, such as credit bureaus, regarding the status and history of your account. However, we are not obligated to 
release any such information to anyone unless required by law to do so.

Laws of the State: Except to the extent that Federal law is applicable, the validity, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all matters 
arising out
of the issuance and use of the Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.  You understand and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of 
the State of Florida and that the exclusive venue for any action or dispute shall be in the courts of Orange County, Florida.

Final Agreement / No Waiver: This Disclosure and Agreement is the definitive agreement between you and the Issuer and may not be 
contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.  The Issuer can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

MasterCard Rules: You agree that your Account shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations of MasterCard International, as applicable, 
as well as all applicable laws. If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and regulations of MasterCard 
International, the rules and regulations of MasterCard International shall control.

Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the 
consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge 
of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Cash advance fees are Finance Charges. Foreign transaction fees are not Finance 
Charges.          
    
Balance Computation Method: Average daily balance method (including current transactions). We figure the interest charge on your account by 
applying the periodic rate to the ""average daily balance"" of your account. To get the ""average daily balance"" we take the beginning balance of your 
account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other Finance Charges and] any payments or 
credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the 
billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance.""

Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Methods: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a Finance Charge for 
that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle's 
billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a Finance Charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your 
account. To avoid an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date of that statement. A Finance Charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first 
day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 

The Finance Charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the Finance Charge is computed by applying the 
monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding 
balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. 
Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This 
gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

Method of Computing Cash Advances: The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the 
AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number 
of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances any new Cash 
Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later and subtracting any payments as received 
and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charge.

Balance Transfers: Balance transfers must be transferred from any financial institution other than CFE. Balance transfers and cash advances may 
not be used to pay any CFE accounts. Balance transfers are treated as and considered cash advances on your account. Amounts transferred are 
subject to your available credit limit. We are not required to honor a balance transfer request that will cause you to exceed your available credit limit. 
We will not be responsible for late payment or non-payment to other card issuers. We are not responsible for fees that may be charged for cash 
advances performed at other financial institutions and ATMs owners. There is no grace period for balance transfers.
It may take up to three (3) weeks for other financials to post the balance transfer transaction. You should continue to make all required payments 
until you confirm that the balance transfer was posted to the other financial institution. We will not close your other accounts even if you transfer the 
entire balance. If you wish to close another account, you should contact the issuer directly.

Late Payment Warning: If we do not receive your minimum payment by the date listed on your statement you may have to pay a late

17.75%.  *The late payment fee for balances over $499 will be based on the greater amount of $20 or 3% of the outstanding balance not to 
exceed $25.

Penalty APR: Each time your account becomes 60 days past due, the Penalty APR will apply to all account balances. Any 
Promotional or Introductory APR will end and the Penalty APR will begin on the first day of the billing period. After you have 
made all the required payments on time for six consecutive billing periods, the Annual Percentage Rate will be reduced to the 
regular account APR beginning the first day of your next billing period. The change to your Penalty APR applies to all existing 
and future balances on your account.

Returned Check or Rejected Payment: If you pay us electronically or by check and your financial institution does not honor 
the payment or check, a fee of $25 will apply.

Over-the-credit-limit: If at any time your account balance is over your credit limit a fee will not be charged.  

Special Services: CFE reserves the right to charge a fee for Special Services that you request, if such charges are not prohibited 
by law or regulation. No Finance Charge will be assessed on such additional charges.  For example, a $5 fee applies for each 
copy of a document that you request (except when the request is made in connection with the investigation of a billing error 
made by the Issuer).  You may be charged $5 if you order a replacement card. The fee for other Special Services, if applicable, 
will be disclosed to you prior to processing the request. Additionally, there will be a $20 per hour or $5 minimum research fee.

notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.

been lost, stolen, or an unauthorized use has occurred, notify PSCU Financial Services - Credit Card Security Department immediately at 800-449-

card after you notify us. If you don't meet these conditions, or if the unauthorized use occurred at an ATM, your liability will not exceed $50.

Foreign Transactions and Currency Conversion: For MasterCard, if you effect a transaction with your MasterCard in a currency other 
than U.S. dollars, MasterCard International Incorporated will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard International 
will use its currency conversion procedure, which is disclosed to institutions that issue MasterCard cards. Currently the currency 
conversion rate used by MasterCard International to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars for such transactions is 
generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by MasterCard International for the processing cycle in 
which the transaction is processed, increased by an adjustment factor established from time to time by MasterCard International. The 
currency conversion rate used by MasterCard International on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been 
used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. You agree to pay the converted amount in U.S. dollars, plus any 
charge for conversion or processing that may be imposed by the Issuer, plus any charge that may be imposed for an international 
transaction, regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion. The 1% International Service Assessment fee applies to all 
international transactions regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion.

Protected Balances Due to Rate Increases: Protected balances are the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an 
increased annual percentage rate cannot be applied after the rate for that category of transactions has been increased.

Annual Fee: No annual fee applies to this credit card.

Illegal Use and Internet Gambling: You agree that all transactions that you initiate by use of your card are legal in the jurisdiction where you live 
and/or where the transaction occurred. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located, including the United States. Your 
card may only be used for legal transactions. Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not mean that internet gambling 
transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which you may be located. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions 
you initiate by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.



USA Patriot Act: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: When you open an account at 
CFE, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's 
license or other identifying documents.

and the local law enforcement officials immediately. We want the ATM and night deposit facility to be safe and convenient for you.

payment on amounts previously drawn.  The credit limit will be determined by the Issuer, and will be drawn upon as you utilize the Account.  You 
agree not to use your Card or permit the use of your Account to obtain credit purchases or loans which will increase your credit card indebtedness to 
us to an amount in excess of the established limit. 

Statements and Notices: CFE will send you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union, at monthly intervals determined by us, a 
statement reflecting all Account activity for the prior period (""cycle""), including purchases, cash advances, fees, and payments.  Additional notices 
and information may be sent to you at any time.  Such statements, notices, and information will be sent to the most recent mailing address you have

the outstanding balance in excess of your credit limit, plus any amount past due.  If the outstanding balance of your account is $20 or less, it will be 
payable in full.  CFE may accept checks marked ""Payment in Full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of our rights to collect the full 
balance of your account. Except where prohibited by law, satisfaction of your account balance for less than the New Balance requires written 
agreement signed by one of our authorized employees.

Payment Allocation:  Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and 
any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order from the highest APR based on the applicable APR in accordance with law. Any 
payments less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be applied at our discretion. You may no longer direct us how to apply your payment 
among your account types or on balances within your account types.

Default: You will be in default under any of the following circumstances:  1) if you fail to make any minimum payment or other payment required by 
the Issuer on or before the date it is due or if you attempt to in any way avoid payment of your obligations; 2) if you violate any portion of your 
responsibility or promise you made under this agreement; 3) if you file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, meaning you are unable to pay your 
obligations when they are due or if attachment or garnishment proceedings are instituted against you; 4) if you made any false or misleading 
statements in any credit application; 5) if you provided false identification or records in connection with any credit application or credit update; 6) in 
the event of your death; 7) if you incur charges for Purchases and Cash Advances which exceed the maximum authorized credit limit; and/or 8) if the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, believes your ability to repay what you owe may be substantially reduced due to an event either within or beyond your 
control. Failure by Issuer to assert any rights hereunder shall not waive such rights. 

When you are in default, the Issuer may demand immediate payment of your Account balance in full without giving you prior notice.  If immediate 
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying Finance Charges at the annual percentage rate established for this account by the Issuer, until 
the entire balance has been paid.  Any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe the Issuer.  

Security Interest: You agree that this account is secured by all share and deposit accounts that you have or may have with CFE and that 
collateral pledged for other loans you have with this credit union will also secure your obligation under this agreement. However, unless you 
expressly agree otherwise, your IRA's, household goods and primary dwelling will not secure your obligations under this agreement even if the 
Issuer has or later acquires a security interest in the household goods or a mortgage on the dwelling. This security interest shall continue as 
long as you have your credit card account even if there is no outstanding balance on your account from time to time. You agree that if you do not 
make your credit card account payments on time, or if the balance on your Account exceeds your credit limit, CFE may, without notice to you, take 
funds from one or more of your share accounts to apply to the payment of this Account, and interests and costs, if delinquent and/or over the 
credit limit.

Interest: Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the Finance Charge calculation method referred to in the 
Disclosure box. The rate of interest will be established by Issuer from time to time and will not exceed the maximum rate of 17.75% APR.  The current 
interest rate per annum is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) set forth in the Disclosure box below.

Variable Rate Information: Your APR will vary. The rate for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers is determined by Prime Rate (Wall 
Street Journal Index). The Wall Street Journal Index is published in the consumer rates table of the Wall Street Journal on the 15th of each month (or 
the next business day if not published on the 15th) effective with your billing statement the following month.

Termination of this Agreement: CFE may terminate this agreement under the following conditions: a) upon adverse re-evaluation of your credit 
worthiness; b) if you fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement; and/or c) at your option or our option, if we have good cause.  If your credit card 
Account is to be terminated by the Issuer, you will receive written notice of such termination as applicable by law; however, you understand and 
acknowledge that such termination will not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance, Finance Charge, and fees.  The Card(s) issued to 
you for this Account remain the property of the Issuer.

proceedings are initiated against you or your property, or in the event of your death, CFE may elect to declare all amounts then owed to be 
immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. 

Reapplication: A reapplication by you and approval by the Issuer may be required if: a) the credit limit is increased; or b) the terms of payment are 
extended beyond the terms of the original agreement.

Delinquent loans: You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if your loans with us become delinquent or past due, your credit card Account 
shall be revoked, unless we determine that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency.  Under such circumstances we reserve the 
right to approve your continued use of the credit card.

Enforcing obligations: You agree to pay all costs incurred by CFE in collecting your debt or in enforcing this agreement, including reasonable 
attorney's fees and also those costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post-judgment proceedings, except to the 
extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law.  Should the Issuer employ or engage the services of any entity to enforce any of your 
obligations relating to this agreement, or to protect its interests in any manner arising under this agreement, you agree to pay to CFE all reasonable 
costs or expenses incurred as a result. 

Communications: You agree that we, our agents or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone communications or electronic 
communications with you.  

Credit Review and Release of Information: CFE reserves the right to reinvestigate and reevaluate any information you provided on your credit 
application at anytime. In the course of doing so, we may ask you for additional information, request credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify 
your current credit standing. Effective February 1, 2011, due to federal regulations CFE is required to review your account not less 
frequently than once every six months to reassess your credit worthiness and adjust your APR accordingly, if necessary. You agree that 
we may release information to others, such as credit bureaus, regarding the status and history of your account. However, we are not obligated to 
release any such information to anyone unless required by law to do so.

Laws of the State: Except to the extent that Federal law is applicable, the validity, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all matters 
arising out
of the issuance and use of the Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.  You understand and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of 
the State of Florida and that the exclusive venue for any action or dispute shall be in the courts of Orange County, Florida.

Final Agreement / No Waiver: This Disclosure and Agreement is the definitive agreement between you and the Issuer and may not be 
contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.  The Issuer can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

MasterCard Rules: You agree that your Account shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations of MasterCard International, as applicable, 
as well as all applicable laws. If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and regulations of MasterCard 
International, the rules and regulations of MasterCard International shall control.

Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the 
consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge 
of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Cash advance fees are Finance Charges. Foreign transaction fees are not Finance 
Charges.          
    
Balance Computation Method: Average daily balance method (including current transactions). We figure the interest charge on your account by 
applying the periodic rate to the ""average daily balance"" of your account. To get the ""average daily balance"" we take the beginning balance of your 
account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other Finance Charges and] any payments or 
credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the 
billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance.""

Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Methods: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a Finance Charge for 
that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle's 
billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a Finance Charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your 
account. To avoid an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date of that statement. A Finance Charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first 
day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 

The Finance Charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the Finance Charge is computed by applying the 
monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding 
balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. 
Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This 
gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

Method of Computing Cash Advances: The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the 
AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number 
of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances any new Cash 
Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later and subtracting any payments as received 
and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charge.

Balance Transfers: Balance transfers must be transferred from any financial institution other than CFE. Balance transfers and cash advances may 
not be used to pay any CFE accounts. Balance transfers are treated as and considered cash advances on your account. Amounts transferred are 
subject to your available credit limit. We are not required to honor a balance transfer request that will cause you to exceed your available credit limit. 
We will not be responsible for late payment or non-payment to other card issuers. We are not responsible for fees that may be charged for cash 
advances performed at other financial institutions and ATMs owners. There is no grace period for balance transfers.
It may take up to three (3) weeks for other financials to post the balance transfer transaction. You should continue to make all required payments 
until you confirm that the balance transfer was posted to the other financial institution. We will not close your other accounts even if you transfer the 
entire balance. If you wish to close another account, you should contact the issuer directly. 

Balance transfers and cash advances do not qualify to earn bonus points on the MasterCard Platinum Cash and MasterCard Platinum Rewards 
accounts.

Other Fees May Apply to the Account: Additional charges, plus applicable taxes, may also be assessed on the account.  Such fees are added to

Promotional or Introductory APR will end and the Penalty APR will begin on the first day of the billing period. After you have

regular account APR beginning the first day of your next billing period. The change to your Penalty APR applies to all existing 
and future balances on your account.

the payment or check, a fee of $25 will apply.

Over-the-credit-limit: If at any time your account balance is over your credit limit a fee will not be charged.

by law or regulation. No Finance Charge will be assessed on such additional charges.  For example, a $5 fee applies for each 
copy of a document that you request (except when the request is made in connection with the investigation of a billing error 
made by the Issuer).  You may be charged $5 if you order a replacement card. The fee for other Special Services, if applicable, 
will be disclosed to you prior to processing the request. Additionally, there will be a $20 per hour or $5 minimum research fee.

notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.

been lost, stolen, or an unauthorized use has occurred, notify PSCU Financial Services - Credit Card Security Department immediately at 800-449-
7728. If you have exercised reasonable care in safeguarding your card from loss or theft, you have not reported two or more incidents of

card after you notify us. If you don't meet these conditions, or if the unauthorized use occurred at an ATM, your liability will not exceed $50.

Foreign Transactions and Currency Conversion: For MasterCard, if you effect a transaction with your MasterCard in a currency other 
than U.S. dollars, MasterCard International Incorporated will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard International 
will use its currency conversion procedure, which is disclosed to institutions that issue MasterCard cards. Currently the currency 
conversion rate used by MasterCard International to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars for such transactions is 
generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by MasterCard International for the processing cycle in 
which the transaction is processed, increased by an adjustment factor established from time to time by MasterCard International. The 
currency conversion rate used by MasterCard International on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been 
used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. You agree to pay the converted amount in U.S. dollars, plus any 
charge for conversion or processing that may be imposed by the Issuer, plus any charge that may be imposed for an international 
transaction, regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion. The 1% International Service Assessment fee applies to all 
international transactions regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion.

Protected Balances Due to Rate Increases: Protected balances are the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an 
increased annual percentage rate cannot be applied after the rate for that category of transactions has been increased.

Annual Fee: No annual fee applies to this credit card.

Illegal Use and Internet Gambling: You agree that all transactions that you initiate by use of your card are legal in the jurisdiction where you live 
and/or where the transaction occurred. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located, including the United States. Your 
card may only be used for legal transactions. Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not mean that internet gambling 
transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which you may be located. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions 
you initiate by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.



USA Patriot Act: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: When you open an account at 
CFE, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's 
license or other identifying documents.

Right To Reject Change In Terms: A member may reject a significant change in terms by calling (407) 896-9411 or (800) 771-9411, option 3 or by

Automated Teller Machine (ATM). There are risks of using a PIN at an ATM terminal that has been modified, has a suspicious device attached, may 
not be genuine, or is otherwise operating in a suspicious manner. Therefore, please tell us if you know of any problem with a facility. For instance, 
let us know if a light is not working or there is any damage to a facility. Report any suspicious activity or crimes to both the operator of the facility 
and the local law enforcement officials immediately. We want the ATM and night deposit facility to be safe and convenient for you.

number hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). In addition, you agree to pay all Finance Charges and other charges added to your Account

payment on amounts previously drawn.  The credit limit will be determined by the Issuer, and will be drawn upon as you utilize the Account.  You 
agree not to use your Card or permit the use of your Account to obtain credit purchases or loans which will increase your credit card indebtedness to 
us to an amount in excess of the established limit. 

Statements and Notices: CFE will send you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union, at monthly intervals determined by us, a 
statement reflecting all Account activity for the prior period (""cycle""), including purchases, cash advances, fees, and payments.  Additional notices 
and information may be sent to you at any time.  Such statements, notices, and information will be sent to the most recent mailing address you have 
provided to the Credit Union.  Notice sent to any one authorized user on the Account will constitute notice sent to all authorized users.  Unless you 
notify us in writing within 60 days of the mailing of each statement, the statement will be deemed correct and accepted by you and all authorized 
users of the Account.  

Payment: You agree to pay at least the minimum required payment amount shown on your statement by the date shown on the statement or no 
later than twenty-five (25) days from the statement closing date, whichever is later.  You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum

will be the greater of:  a) $20 or b) 3% of the portion of the outstanding balance which does not exceed your credit limit, plus the entire portion of 
the outstanding balance in excess of your credit limit, plus any amount past due.  If the outstanding balance of your account is $20 or less, it will be 
payable in full.  CFE may accept checks marked ""Payment in Full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of our rights to collect the full 
balance of your account. Except where prohibited by law, satisfaction of your account balance for less than the New Balance requires written 
agreement signed by one of our authorized employees.

Payment Allocation:  Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and 
any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order from the highest APR based on the applicable APR in accordance with law. Any 
payments less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be applied at our discretion. You may no longer direct us how to apply your payment 
among your account types or on balances within your account types.

Default: You will be in default under any of the following circumstances:  1) if you fail to make any minimum payment or other payment required by 
the Issuer on or before the date it is due or if you attempt to in any way avoid payment of your obligations; 2) if you violate any portion of your 
responsibility or promise you made under this agreement; 3) if you file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, meaning you are unable to pay your 
obligations when they are due or if attachment or garnishment proceedings are instituted against you; 4) if you made any false or misleading 
statements in any credit application; 5) if you provided false identification or records in connection with any credit application or credit update; 6) in 
the event of your death; 7) if you incur charges for Purchases and Cash Advances which exceed the maximum authorized credit limit; and/or 8) if the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, believes your ability to repay what you owe may be substantially reduced due to an event either within or beyond your 
control. Failure by Issuer to assert any rights hereunder shall not waive such rights. 

When you are in default, the Issuer may demand immediate payment of your Account balance in full without giving you prior notice.  If immediate 
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying Finance Charges at the annual percentage rate established for this account by the Issuer, until 
the entire balance has been paid.  Any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe the Issuer.  

Security Interest: You agree that this account is secured by all share and deposit accounts that you have or may have with CFE and that 
collateral pledged for other loans you have with this credit union will also secure your obligation under this agreement. However, unless you 
expressly agree otherwise, your IRA's, household goods and primary dwelling will not secure your obligations under this agreement even if the 
Issuer has or later acquires a security interest in the household goods or a mortgage on the dwelling. This security interest shall continue as 
long as you have your credit card account even if there is no outstanding balance on your account from time to time. You agree that if you do not 
make your credit card account payments on time, or if the balance on your Account exceeds your credit limit, CFE may, without notice to you, take 
funds from one or more of your share accounts to apply to the payment of this Account, and interests and costs, if delinquent and/or over the 
credit limit.

Interest: Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the Finance Charge calculation method referred to in the 
Disclosure box. The rate of interest will be established by Issuer from time to time and will not exceed the maximum rate of 17.75% APR.  The current 
interest rate per annum is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) set forth in the Disclosure box below.

Variable Rate Information: Your APR will vary. The rate for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers is determined by Prime Rate (Wall 
Street Journal Index). The Wall Street Journal Index is published in the consumer rates table of the Wall Street Journal on the 15th of each month (or 
the next business day if not published on the 15th) effective with your billing statement the following month.

Termination of this Agreement: CFE may terminate this agreement under the following conditions: a) upon adverse re-evaluation of your credit 
worthiness; b) if you fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement; and/or c) at your option or our option, if we have good cause.  If your credit card 
Account is to be terminated by the Issuer, you will receive written notice of such termination as applicable by law; however, you understand and 
acknowledge that such termination will not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance, Finance Charge, and fees.  The Card(s) issued to 
you for this Account remain the property of the Issuer.   

Card Ownership and Surrender Rules: Each Card is the property of CFE is not transferable and must be surrendered upon demand. The card can 
be cancelled as well as repossessed by CFE or its designee, and the privileges revoked, at any time without prior notice.  If the card is cancelled or 
surrender is demanded by Issuer, or if you default in any payment due, or if you are bankrupt or insolvent, or any attachment or garnishment 
proceedings are initiated against you or your property, or in the event of your death, CFE may elect to declare all amounts then owed to be 
immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. 

Reapplication: A reapplication by you and approval by the Issuer may be required if: a) the credit limit is increased; or b) the terms of payment are 
extended beyond the terms of the original agreement.

Delinquent loans: You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if your loans with us become delinquent or past due, your credit card Account 
shall be revoked, unless we determine that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency.  Under such circumstances we reserve the 
right to approve your continued use of the credit card.

Enforcing obligations: You agree to pay all costs incurred by CFE in collecting your debt or in enforcing this agreement, including reasonable 
attorney's fees and also those costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post-judgment proceedings, except to the 
extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law.  Should the Issuer employ or engage the services of any entity to enforce any of your 
obligations relating to this agreement, or to protect its interests in any manner arising under this agreement, you agree to pay to CFE all reasonable 
costs or expenses incurred as a result. 

Communications: You agree that we, our agents or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone communications or electronic 
communications with you.  

Credit Review and Release of Information: CFE reserves the right to reinvestigate and reevaluate any information you provided on your credit 
application at anytime. In the course of doing so, we may ask you for additional information, request credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify 
your current credit standing. Effective February 1, 2011, due to federal regulations CFE is required to review your account not less 
frequently than once every six months to reassess your credit worthiness and adjust your APR accordingly, if necessary. You agree that 
we may release information to others, such as credit bureaus, regarding the status and history of your account. However, we are not obligated to 
release any such information to anyone unless required by law to do so.

Laws of the State: Except to the extent that Federal law is applicable, the validity, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all matters 
arising out
of the issuance and use of the Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.  You understand and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of 
the State of Florida and that the exclusive venue for any action or dispute shall be in the courts of Orange County, Florida.

Final Agreement / No Waiver: This Disclosure and Agreement is the definitive agreement between you and the Issuer and may not be 
contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.  The Issuer can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

MasterCard Rules: You agree that your Account shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations of MasterCard International, as applicable, 
as well as all applicable laws. If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and regulations of MasterCard 
International, the rules and regulations of MasterCard International shall control.

Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the 
consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge 
of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Cash advance fees are Finance Charges. Foreign transaction fees are not Finance 
Charges.          
    
Balance Computation Method: Average daily balance method (including current transactions). We figure the interest charge on your account by 
applying the periodic rate to the ""average daily balance"" of your account. To get the ""average daily balance"" we take the beginning balance of your 
account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other Finance Charges and] any payments or 
credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the 
billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance.""

Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Methods: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a Finance Charge for 
that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle's 
billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a Finance Charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your 
account. To avoid an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date of that statement. A Finance Charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first 
day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 

The Finance Charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the Finance Charge is computed by applying the 
monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding 
balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. 
Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This 
gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

Method of Computing Cash Advances: The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the 
AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number 
of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances any new Cash 
Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later and subtracting any payments as received 
and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charge.

Balance Transfers: Balance transfers must be transferred from any financial institution other than CFE. Balance transfers and cash advances may 
not be used to pay any CFE accounts. Balance transfers are treated as and considered cash advances on your account. Amounts transferred are 
subject to your available credit limit. We are not required to honor a balance transfer request that will cause you to exceed your available credit limit. 
We will not be responsible for late payment or non-payment to other card issuers. We are not responsible for fees that may be charged for cash 
advances performed at other financial institutions and ATMs owners. There is no grace period for balance transfers.
It may take up to three (3) weeks for other financials to post the balance transfer transaction. You should continue to make all required payments 
until you confirm that the balance transfer was posted to the other financial institution. We will not close your other accounts even if you transfer the 
entire balance. If you wish to close another account, you should contact the issuer directly. 

Balance transfers and cash advances do not qualify to earn bonus points on the MasterCard Platinum Cash and MasterCard Platinum Rewards 
accounts.

Other Fees May Apply to the Account: Additional charges, plus applicable taxes, may also be assessed on the account.  Such fees are added to 
the balance of the Account and will be notated on your statement.  Fees will not be included in any Finance Charge calculation. Use of the card 
constitutes your understanding of an agreement to the following Fee Schedule:
