creditcardagreement_1368.TXT,"First Command Bank Visa Cardholder Agreement (Platinum/Classic)

The person(s) (""Cardholder,"" whether one or more) who signed and 
returned the Application for a Visa (""Application"") has requested First 
Command Bank (""Bank"") to extend to Cardholder open-end credit. The 
term ""Cardholder"" means each person who signed and returned the 
Application and any other person who has agreed to be responsible for 
the Account (defined below). As used in this Agreement, the term 
�person� means an individual or an entity, as applicable. By Cardholder's 
use of the credit card (""Card""), furnished by Bank in reliance in part upon 
the information supplied by Cardholder in the Application, Cardholder 
agrees with Bank as follows: 

1. Using the Account. Cardholder has accepted the revolving tri-party 
account (""Account"") made available to Cardholder by Bank. Cardholder 
may use the Card to purchase or lease goods or services, or pay 
amounts that Cardholder owes, wherever the Card is honored (""Credit 
Purchases""). Cardholder may also use the Card to obtain cash loans 
(""Cash Advances"") from any financial institution that accepts the Card. 
Cardholder agrees that the Account will not be used to access gambling 
web sites or to purchase illegal goods or services. Bank may refuse to 
process any transaction that Bank believes may violate this Agreement. 
If Cardholder provides the Account number to make a purchase or 
obtain an advance without presenting the Card (such as for a mail order 
or telephone purchase), or if Cardholder authorizes someone else to 
make a charge to the Account, Cardholder's obligation to pay will be the 
same as if the Card itself was used. Cash Advances also may be ob-
tained through use of the Card (a) upon execution of a written request of 
Cardholder in a form furnished by any financial institution that is a 
member, alone or in association with others, of Visa, Inc. or (b) upon 
Cardholder's execution of a written separate agreement with Bank for a 
Visa overdraft financial agreement, if offered by Bank. All Credit Pur-
chases and Cash Advances are effected at the option of the retail 
merchant (""Seller"") and/or cash advancing financial institution respec-
tively, and Bank shall not be responsible for refusal by any Seller or 
cash advancing financial institution to honor the Card or any ""Related 
Card,"" as defined in paragraph 2 below. 

2. Obligations on the Account. Cardholder (jointly or severally if more 
than one) promises to pay Bank at the address specified on the periodic 
statement (see paragraph 5 below) for all Credit Purchases and Cash 
Advances, together with any Finance Charge as herein provided, plus 
any other charges permitted by this Agreement, all such payments must 
be in lawful money of the United States of America. Cardholder will pay 
in their equivalent in U.S. dollars all charges in a foreign currency, which 
equivalence will be determined by reference to the amount in U.S. 
dollars. Bank shall have paid in good faith to the person presenting the 
item to Bank. Cardholder shall be liable and agrees to pay Bank for 
Credit Purchases made by, or for Cash Advances extended to, Card-
holder or anyone else using the Card unless the use of such Card is by a 
person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, implied, 
or apparent authority for such use and (b) from which Cardholder rece-
ives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally 
liable, and agrees to pay, for all Credit Purchases and Cash Advances 
obtained through the use of any other Card bearing Cardholder's Ac-
count number that has been issued to another person by reason of such 
person being a member of Cardholder's family, or otherwise issued upon 
Cardholder's request (all such Cards bearing the same Account number 
hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). Subject to any mandato-
ry provisions of applicable law, all payments made by Cardholder will be 
applied to the balances on Cardholder's Account in the manner set forth 
later in this Agreement. 

3. Credit Limit. Bank will inform Cardholder from time to time of the 
maximum amount of debt (""Credit Limit"") that may be outstanding in the 
Account at any time, and Bank, in its sole discretion may adjust the 
Credit Limit from time to time. Cardholder agrees not to use or permit the 
use of the Card in any manner that would cause the outstanding balance 
in the Account ever to exceed the Credit Limit. If Cardholder attempts a 
transaction which results in Cardholder�s total outstanding balance (plus 
authorizations) exceeding Cardholder's Credit Limit, Bank may: (a) 
permit the transaction without raising Cardholder's Credit Limit; (b) 
permit the transaction and treat the amount of the transaction that is 
more than the Credit Limit as immediately due; or (c) refuse to permit the 
transaction. If Bank refuses to permit the transaction, Bank may advise 
the person who attempted the transaction that it has been refused. If 
Bank has previously permitted Cardholder to exceed Cardholder's Credit 
Limit, it does not mean that Bank will permit Cardholder to exceed 
Cardholder's Credit Limit on a subsequent date. Bank may designate 
that only a portion of Cardholder's Credit Limit is available for Cash 
Advances. If Cardholder exceeds that limit, Cardholder will be consi-
dered to have exceeded the Credit Limit for all purposes under this 
Agreement. 

4. Notices. Bank will send periodic statements and any other notices to 
Cardholder at the address shown in Bank's files. If this is a joint Account, 
Bank can send periodic statements and notices to either Cardholder. 
Cardholder promises to inform Bank promptly, in writing, of any changes 
in Cardholder's address. Cardholder authorizes Bank, or anyone acting 
on Bank's behalf, to call or send a text message to any number Card-
holder provides or to any number where Bank may reasonably believe 
Bank can contact cardholder, including calls to mobile, cellular, or 
similar devices, and calls using automatic telephone dialing systems 
and/or pre-recorded messages, or to send an email to any address 
where Bank reasonably believes Bank can contact Cardholder. Calls 
and messages may be made for any lawful purpose, including but not 
limited to: suspected fraud or identity theft; obtaining information; Card-
holder's account transactions or servicing; collecting on Cardholder's 
account; and providing Cardholder information about products and 
services. 

5. Periodic Statement. As of the end of each monthly billing cycle, 
Cardholder will be furnished a periodic statement showing, among other 
things, (a) the amount owed (""Previous Balance"") at the beginning of the 
billing cycle, (b) the amount of all Cash Advances, Credit Purchases and 
Finance Charge posted to the Account during the billing cycle, (c) the 
amount of all payments and credits posted to the Account during the 
billing cycle, and (d) the total amount due (""New Balance"") at the end of 
the billing cycle (which amount is the sum of [a] and [b] less [c]), (e) the 
""Minimum Payment,"" and (f) the ""Payment Due Date."" If Cardholder is 
composed of more than one person, only one periodic statement will be 
provided. 

6. Minimum Payment. Cardholder agrees to pay to Bank, on or prior to 
the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, the sum of (a) 
either (i) the entire New Balance or (ii) at Cardholder's option, an amount 
which shall be at least 2.50% of the New Balance (rounded up to the 
nearest dollar) or $50.00, whichever is greater, and (b) any amount that 
is past due and any amount that is over the Credit Limit. If the New 
Balance is less than $50.00, it shall be paid in full. Cardholder may pay 
more than the Minimum Payment, and may at any time pay the full 
amount owing to Bank. If Cardholder pays more than the Minimum 
Payment, Cardholder must still pay the Minimum Payment as reflected 
on the next periodic statement. The Payment Due Date for a billing cycle 
will be not less than twenty-five (25) days after the preceding billing 
cycle ends (the ""Closing Date""). 

7. Annual Fee: Bank does not charge an annual fee for the Card. 

8. Late Payment Fee. If Bank does not receive a payment from Card-
holder in at least the amount of the Minimum Payment within 30 days 
after the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, Bank may 
charge Cardholder a late payment fee in the amount stated below in the 
Table of Charges. Cardholder will only be charged a late payment fee for 
any Minimum Payment which is not paid within 30 days after the Pay-
ment Due Date. 

9. Cash Advance Fee. Each time Cardholder uses the Card or a Con-
venience Check to obtain a Cash Advance, Bank will assess a cash 
advance fee in the amount stated in the Table of Charges. 

10. When Finance Charge Begins. Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account for all Cash Advances from the later of (a) the day the Cash 
Advance is posted to the Account, or (b) the first day of the billing cycle 
in which the Cash Advance is posted until Cardholder pays the transac-
tion(s) in full. For Credit Purchases, Bank adds a Finance Charge to the 
Account if the Cardholder does not pay the New Balance in full by the 
Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement. If Bank adds a 
Finance Charge, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge on all 
amounts Cardholder owes Bank (except ""New Purchases"") from the first 
day of the billing cycle; provided, however, any portion of the New 
Balance subject to a grace period that is paid prior to the expiration of 
the grace period will not be assessed a Finance Charge. For New 
Purchases, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge from the date 
Bank posts the New Purchase to the Account unless Cardholder has 
paid the New Balance in full on the previous periodic statement. A New 
Purchase is one that appears on the periodic statement for the first time. 

11. Calculation of Finance Charge. Bank calculates the Finance 
Charge on the Account by applying the ""Periodic Rate"" (defined below) 
to the ""Average Daily Balance"" of the Account. To obtain the Average 
Daily Balance, Bank starts with the beginning balance of the Account on 
each day, excluding unpaid Finance Charges. Bank adds any Cash 
Advances posted to the Account that day, and any New Purchases, 
unless Cardholder paid the New Balance in full for the previous billing 
cycle by the Payment Due Date. Bank subtracts any credits and pay-
ments (after any unpaid Finance Charges are paid) posted to the Ac-
count that day. This results in the ""Daily Balance."" Then, Bank adds up 
all the Daily Balances for the billing cycle and divides that by the total 
number of days in the billing cycle. This results in the Average Daily 
Balance. The Finance Charge on the Account is calculated by multiply-
ing the Average Daily Balance by the Periodic Rate for Classic which is 
.008542 and the Periodic Rate for Platinum which is .005208 (but 
subject to change from time to time).

*Bank adds 3% to the Prime Rate to determine Platinum APR (Periodic 
Rate currently .005208). 

For Credit Purchases and Cash Advances which occur on a Platinum 
Account, the APR varies with changes to the Prime Rate. The �Prime 
Rate� is the highest prime rate published in the Money Rates column of 
the Wall Street Journal 30 days before the Closing Date on Cardholder�s 
periodic statement (the �Calculation Date�). On May 1, 2010 the Prime 
Rate was 3.25% therefore the APR was 6.25%. A variable APR will go 
up and down depending on the Prime Rate as of each Calculation Date; 
however, a variable rate APR is subject to change only on the first day of 
each billing cycle. If the Prime Rate and the corresponding APR in-
crease, the Finance Charge also will increase and Cardholder�s Mini-
mum Payment may also increase. The Prime Rate is only a pricing 
index and is not the lowest interest rate available. 

12. Other Payment Terms. All payments received on or before (a) 5 
o'clock p.m. (Fort Worth, Texas time) on Bank's business day at the 
address indicated on the periodic statement, or (b) the closing time of 
the applicable branch if payment is made in person, will be credited to 
the Account as of the date of receipt of payment. If payment is made at 
any other location, credit for the payment may be delayed up to 5 days. 
Bank can accept late or partial payments, as well as payments that are 
marked with ""Paid In Full"" or any other similar language without losing or 
waiving any of Bank�s rights or Cardholder's obligations under this 
Agreement. Payment by check constitutes Cardholder's authorization for 
Bank to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from Cardholder's 
bank to make such payment. Bank is not responsible for any lost or 
stolen cash payments. Payments and credits to the Account will be 
applied in the following order: 

. Unpaid Finance Charge; 
. Late Fee; 
. Cash Advance from previous billing cycle; 
. Credit Purchases from previous billing cycle; 
. Cash Advances from current billing cycle; and 
. Credit Purchases from current billing cycle. 


13. Convenience Checks. Bank may issue ""Convenience Checks"" to 
Cardholder that may be used to access the Account. Use of a Conveni-
ence Check will be treated as a Cash Advance in the amount of the 
Check. Each Convenience Check will contain Cardholder's Account 
Number, and may be used only by the person(s) whose name(s) is/are 
printed on it. Each Convenience Check must be completed and signed in 
the same way as a regular personal check. If Bank provides Conveni-


ence Checks for the Account, Cardholder may not use them to pay any 
amount Cardholder owes under this Agreement. Cardholder agrees that 
Bank need not return Convenience Checks to Cardholder after their use, 
and that, if Cardholder needs evidence of any payment represented by 
the Convenience Check, a photocopy or similar reproduction will be 
satisfactory for such purposes. If Cardholder wishes to prevent payment 
of a Convenience Check, the instructions which Bank provides when the 
Convenience Checks are issued must be followed. In the event payment 
of a Convenience Check has been stopped, Cardholder agrees to hold 
Bank harmless and indemnify Bank for any losses, expenses and costs, 
including attorney's fees incurred by Bank, for preventing payment of 
any Convenience Check. Bank will use its best efforts to stop payment, 
but will incur no liability to Cardholder if it is unable to stop payment on a 
Convenience Check. 

14. Termination. Bank may terminate Cardholder's privileges under this 
Agreement or limit Cardholder's right to make Credit Purchases or 
receive Cash Advances at any time (and list Cardholder's Account in 
warning bulletins in the event of such termination) without any reason or 
without advance notice or resulting liability. If Bank requests, Cardholder 
must return the Card and Convenience Checks to Bank. Cardholder 
agrees that Cardholder will not try to make a Credit Purchase or obtain a 
Cash Advance after Cardholder has been notified that Cardholder's 
privilege to use the Account has been terminated. Cardholder may 
terminate this Agreement at any time. If Cardholder does terminate, all 
Cards and Convenience Checks previously issued on the Account must 
be returned to Bank. If Cardholder telephones Bank with the termination 
request, Bank may require that Cardholder confirm such intent to termi-
nate in writing. Bank's or Cardholder's termination will not affect Card-
holder's existing obligations under this Agreement or Cardholder's 
liability for all charges posted to Cardholder's Account prior to the time 
all Cards and Convenience Checks are returned to Bank. When the 
Account is closed, Cardholder must contact everyone authorized to 
charge transactions to the Account, such as internet service providers, 
health clubs or insurance companies. These transactions may continue 
to be charged to the Account until Cardholder changes the billing. Also, if 
the Bank believes Cardholder has authorized a transaction or is attempt-
ing to use Cardholder�s Account after Cardholder has requested to close 
the Account, Bank may allow the transaction to be charged to the 
Account. If the Account is terminated by Cardholder or by Bank for 
reasons other than Cardholder's default, Cardholder will be required to 
pay the outstanding balance on the Account according to the terms of 
this Agreement immediately prior to such termination. 

15. Default. If (a) Cardholder defaults in any payment required to be 
made on the Account or otherwise violates any provision of this Agree-
ment, or (b) Cardholder dies or seeks to obtain any relief as a debtor in 
any proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor relief law, or 
(c) Cardholder provides Bank with false or misleading information or 
signatures at any time, or (d) Cardholder fails to make any payment or 
perform any promise in any other agreement or obligation that Card-
holder owes Bank, then Cardholder will be in default under this Agree-
ment. Bank, upon such default, may at its election (a) decline to extend 
further credit under this Agreement (and Cardholder agrees not to make 
further Credit Purchases or to obtain further Cash Advances) and (b) 
declare all amounts then owed to Bank by Cardholder immediately due 
and payable, without prior notice or demand of any kind, except as may 
be required by applicable law. After Bank declares all amounts then 
owed to Bank by Cardholder to be due and payable, and terminates 
Cardholder�s credit privileges under the Account Bank, at its option (but 
only after providing to Cardholder notice if such is required by applicable 
law), may increase the Annual Percentage Rate up to 18%, which is the 
Default Rate under the Table of Charges. 

16. Collection Charges. If Cardholder defaults, to the extent permitted 
by applicable law, Cardholder agrees to pay (a) all amounts actually 
incurred by Bank as court costs and attorneys' fees set by a court in 
connection with the collection of amounts due by Cardholder under the 
Account and (b) premiums or other identifiable charges received in 
connection with the permitted sale of insurance. In addition, Bank may 
impose on Cardholder a processing fee of $20.00 if a check provided to 
Bank by Cardholder is dishonored for any reason. The dishonored check 
processing fee may be added to the New Balance and is payable on the 
next following due date, however, such fee will not accrue any Finance 
Charge. 

17. Governing Law. This Agreement is performable in Texas and is 
made pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance 
Code, as amended. THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, AND EN-
FORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL MATTERS ARISING 
OUT OF THE ISSUANCE AND USE OF THE CARD SHALL BE GO-
VERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND, TO THE 
EXTENT APPLICABLE, THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. 

18. Amendment. The terms of this Agreement including, but not limited 
to, the rate or index, formula or provision of law used to compute the 
ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are subject to revision as to current and 
future balances, from time to time, by written notice from Bank to Card-
holder as provided by applicable law. 

19. Telephone Conversations. Cardholder agrees that Bank, its 
agents, or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone 
communications with Cardholder. 

20. Liability for Unauthorized Use. Cardholder may be liable for 
unauthorized use of the Account. If the Card is lost or stolen, or if Card-
holder believes someone is using the Account without proper authority, 
Cardholder must notify Bank immediately by calling 1-800-325-3678. 
Cardholder will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after 
Cardholder notifies Bank of the loss or theft of the Card or Convenience 
Check, or the possible unauthorized use of the Account. Bank may 
terminate or limit access to the Account if Cardholder has notified Bank, 
or if Bank has determined that the Card or Convenience Check may 
have been lost or stolen, or that there may be unauthorized access to 
the Account. Cardholder agrees to provide Bank with complete coopera-
tion in Bank's efforts to recover any stolen Card or Convenience Check 
and amounts due from unauthorized users, and in prosecuting unautho-
rized users. 

21. Bank�s Liability for Failing to Make Transfers. If Bank does not 
complete a transaction to or from the Account on time or in the correct 
amount according to this Agreement, Bank may be liable for Cardhold-
er's losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. Bank will 
not be liable, for instance: (a) if, through no fault of Bank's, the available 
credit is insufficient for the transaction or is unavailable for withdrawal 
(for example, because funds have not been finally collected or are 
subject to legal process); (b) if a computer system, ATM, or point of sale 
terminal did not have enough cash or was not working properly and 
Cardholder knew about the problem when Cardholder started the trans-
action; (c) if Cardholder attempts to use the Account or the Card which 
has not been properly activated; (d) if the Card has been reported as lost 
or stolen, has been suspended by Bank or Bank has reason to believe 
the transaction is not authorized by Cardholder, or if Cardholder is trying 
to defraud Bank; or (e) as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

22. Assignment of Account. Cardholder agrees that Bank may at any 
time assign and transfer Cardholder's Account, this Agreement, and 
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, without Cardholder's 
consent or notice to Cardholder. The person to whom the Account and 
Agreement is assigned shall be entitled to all of Bank's rights under this 
Agreement. 

23. Information Sharing. Cardholder authorizes Bank to share informa-
tion concerning Cardholder and Cardholder�s Account with companies 
related to Bank by common ownership. Cardholder authorizes Bank to 
share information with companies in which Bank has an ownership 
interest, concerning purchases made by Cardholder using Cardholder�s 
Account, for the purpose of obtaining special merchandise offers or 
discounts for Cardholder. Cardholder does not authorize Bank to dis-
close Cardholder�s name, address, telephone number or other personal 
information to these companies. 

24. Credit Reporting Agencies. Bank may give information about 
Cardholder's payment history under this Agreement to other persons or 
companies when permitted by law. Cardholder authorizes Bank to make 
whatever credit or investigative inquiries Bank deems necessary in the 
course of review of any credit extended under this Agreement. A nega-
tive credit report which may affect Cardholder's credit record may be 
submitted to a credit reporting agency if Cardholder fails to keep Card-
holder's promises under this Agreement. 

25. Delay of Rights. Bank can waive or delay enforcement of any of its 
rights under this Agreement without losing them. 

26. Separable Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to 
be invalid or enforceable, the rest of this Agreement will not be affected. 
Cardholder will not be held liable for Finance Charges or other fees and 
charges greater than the maximum allowed by law that applies. 

27. Limitation of Responsibility. Bank will not be responsible for 
merchandise or services purchased by Cardholder with the Card or 
Convenience Check unless required by law. Any refund, adjustment or 
credit allowed by a Seller shall not be cash, but rather be by a credit 
advice to Bank which shall be shown as a credit on the periodic state-
ment. Bank will not be responsible for the refusal of any person to honor 
the Card or Convenience Check or if Cardholder is not able to use the 
Card at an ATM. (a) Bank will not be responsible for merchandise or 
services purchased by Cardholder with the Card or Convenience Check 
unless required by law. Any refund, adjustment or credit allowed by a 
Seller shall not be cash, but rather be by a credit advice to Bank which 
shall be shown as a credit on the periodic statement. Bank will not be 
responsible for the refusal of any person to honor the Card or Conveni-
ence Check or if Cardholder is not able to use the Card at an ATM[; and 
(b) BANK WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO CARDHOLDER FOR DELAYS OR 
MISTAKES RESULTING FROM ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND 
BANK'S CONTROL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTS OF 
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, NATIONAL EMERGENCIES, 
INSURRECTION, WAR, OR RIOTS; THE FAILURE OF MERCHANTS 
TO HONOR THE CARD; THE FAILURE OF MERCHANTS TO PER-
FORM OR PROVIDE SERVICES; COMMUNICATION SYSTEMFAI-
LURES; OR FAILURES OR MALFUNCTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO 
CARDHOLDER'S EQUIPMENT, ANY INTERNET SERVICE, OR ANY 
PAYMENT SYSTEM. IN THE EVENT THAT BANK IS HELD LIABLE 
TO CARDHOLDER, CARDHOLDER WILL ONLY BE ENTITLED TO 
RECOVER CARDHOLDER'S ACTUAL DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT 
SHALL CARDHOLDER BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ANY INDIRECT, 
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (WHETH-
ER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF CARDHOLDER 
HAS ADVISED BANK OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
THIS PROVISION SHALL NOT BE EFFECTIVE TO THE EXTENT 
OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW. 

28. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies. If Cardholder makes a 
transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be converted by 
Visa into a U.S. dollar amount in accordance with the operating regula-
tions or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is 
processed. Currently, those regulations and procedures provide that the 
currency conversion rate to be used is either (a) a wholesale market rate 
or (b) a government-mandated rate in effect one (1) day prior to the 
processing date, increased by one percent (1%) in each case. Visa 
retains this one percent as compensation for performing the currency 
conversion service. The currency conversion rate in effect on the 
processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date 
or the posting date. 

29. USA Patriot Act. Bank is subject to the requirement of the USA 
Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107 56 [signed into law October 26, 2001]) 
(the �Act�) and hereby notifies Cardholder that pursuant to the require-
ments of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify, and record information 
that identifies Cardholder which information includes the name and 
address of Cardholder and other information that will allow such Bank to 
identify Cardholder in accordance with the Act. 

30. Other Agreements. This Agreement supersedes all prior Agree-
ments between Bank and Cardholder governing the use of the Card and 
the Account.

your bill. Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you not 
later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or 
problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve 
your rights. 

In your letter, please give us the following information: 

. Your name and Account Number. 
. The dollar amount of the suspected error.

Introduction. This Agreement covers this VISA Platinum Credit Card issued by iQ Credit Union (�Lender�). In this Agreement the words �you,� �your,� �yours,� �applicant,� and �Bor�rowers� mean any person who signs the application for this Account, any joint obligor, guarantor, authorized user,or the person whose name is embossed on the Card. The words �we,��us,��our,� and �Lender� means iQ Credit Union. The word �Card� means any one or more credit cards issued under this Account.  If you sign an application for this Account or sign or use any Card or PIN, or allow others to use the Card or PIN, you and they will have accepted this Agreement just as if you and they signed it, and you and they, jointly and severally, will be bound by the following terms and conditions which will govern this Account. 

2. 
You Promise to Pay. You promise to pay us in United States dollars, by cash, check or money order as provided in this Agreement, all such amounts, plus FINANCE CHARGES, which arise from use of the Card or Account by you or any other person, and to be jointly and severally liable with such a person, unless such other person does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and you received no bene.t from the use. This includes any loan requests for credit card purchases, payments to a third party, or for deposit to a deposit, share, or share draft account of yours, or any co-applicant at the Credit Union. You agree to pay advances requested by any co-applicant the same as if you asked for the loan and it was paid to you. 

3. 
Purchases and Cash Advances. You must sign the Card to use it. Once you have signed the Card, you can use it to buy or lease goods or services, wherever the Card is honored, up to the full amount of your credit line. You also may use your Account and Card to get cash advances from us or participating .nancial institutions. You may use your Card and Personal Identi.cation Number (�PIN�) to obtain cash advances at automated teller machines (�ATMs�) designated with the VISA or Plus System networks. The periodic statement will identify the merchant or .nancial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. We may impose a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request. 

4. 
Convenience Checks. If we approve, you may obtain advances under your Account by writing preprinted loan drafts (�convenience checks�) that we supply to you. Your use of conve�nience checks will be shown as credit advances on your periodic statement. We may not honor the convenience check if it is postdated, payment of the check will exceed your credit limit, a convenience check is signed by a person without authorized access, the amount of the check is less than the minimum required amount, your Account has been terminated or suspended, or any convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen. You may stop payment on a convenience check if you provide us with the exact information describing the convenience check. If you give us incorrect information, we will not be responsible for failing to stop payment. You understand there may be a charge for convenience check printing and charges for stop payment requests, returned items, check copies, and other fees or costs we incur in handling your convenience checks. Our liability for a wrongful dishonor is limited to your actual losses; however, a dishonor for the reasons stated above is not a wrongful dishonor. 

5. 	
Rebate Program. You may earn a 1.00% cash rebate on your Account if you meet the following requirements: 

a. 
Cash Rebate on Net Purchases. You may earn a .50% cash rebate on net purchases (purchases less returns for credit) made during a rebate period in which the net purchases posted to your Account total $2,500 or more. Cash advance transactions, including convenience checks and balance transfers, do not qualify for the cash rebate. The cash rebate will be calculated on cumulative net purchases posted to your Account for the prior rebate period. To illustrate, let us assume that during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) your total net purchases equal $3,500. In this example, we would multiply $3,500 by .50%, which would equal a cash rebate of $17.50. 

b. 
Cash Rebate on Average Daily Balance. 	You may earn a .50% cash rebate on the average daily balance in your Account if you maintain an average daily balance of $4,000 during a rebate period. The cash rebate will be calculated each quarter based on the average daily balance in your Account for the prior rebate period. For example, if the average daily balance in your Account during the .rst rebate period of the year (January - March) was $5,800, we would multiply $5,800 by .50%; which would equal a cash rebate of $29.00. 




There are four rebate periods in each calendar year:January 1 through March 31,April 1 through June 30,July 1 through September 30,and October 1 through December 31.The cash rebate for the prior rebate period will be credited to your checking or savings account by the 15th day of the month following the end of the prior rebate period. The maximum cash rebate you can earn on your Account is $300 per quarter, inclusive of cash rebates for net purchases and average daily balances. Your Account must remain open and in good standing in order to receive the cash rebate. If at any time your Account is assessed a late fee, is closed or is in default, you will forfeit all cash rebates accrued through the calendar quarter in which your Account was closed, or the delinquency or default occurred. The terms and conditions of this rebate program may be changed or cancelled at any time and for any reason without notice. 
6. 
Minimum Periodic Payment. You agree that you will pay each month not less than the minimum payment on or before the scheduled due date. The minimum payment will be three percent (3.0%) of your outstanding balance or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the greater of any amount past due or any amount in excess of your credit line. 

7. 
Periodic Statements. If, at the end of any monthly periodic interval which we may determine the �Billing Cycle,� you have an outstanding undisputed debit or credit balance in your Account, or if there is any FINANCE CHARGE imposed with respect to your Account, we will send you a periodic statement regarding the Account for that Billing Cycle. The statement will show any purchases, cash advances, payments, and credits made to your Account during the Billing Cycle, as well as your �New Balance,� any FINANCE CHARGE, any late charge, or other charges. You may elect to receive your statement information electronically. Your statement also will identify the �Required Payment Due� you must make for that Billing Cycle and the date it is due. You may pay in full for all your purchases and cash advances each month or you may repay in monthly installments. You agree to retain for state�ment veri.cation copies of transaction slips resulting from each purchase, each advance, and other transaction on your Account. Unless you notify us of a billing error as described below, you accept your monthly statement as an accurate statement of your Account with us. 

8. 
Credit Line. This Agreement will constitute a revolving line of credit, and we will advise you of the amount of your credit line. That amount will be the maximum amount you may have outstanding at any one time. You agree not to attempt to obtain more credit than the amount of your credit line. However, if you temporarily exceed your credit line, you agree to pay any overlimit fees and repay the excess immediately, even if we have not yet billed you. Obtaining such credit does not increase your credit line. We retain the right to increase or decrease your credit line at any time for any reason. Any increase or reduction on the limit of your credit line will be shown on your monthly statement or by separate notice together with any changes in the applicable minimum monthly payments. The minimum credit limit is $5,000. 

9. 
Circumstances Under Which a FINANCE CHARGE Will Be Imposed. The total outstanding balance of purchases and cash advances in the Account on the closing date of a Billing Cycle, including any FINANCE CHARGE will be shown on the Periodic Statement for that billing cycle as the �New Balance.� 

a. 
Purchases. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the closing date. This �grace period� allows you to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases for a billing cycle. If you do not pay the entire New Balance within the grace period, your FINANCE CHARGE will accrue from the date of purchase. 

b. 
Cash Advances. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances from the date each cash advance is made. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid a periodic FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances. In addition, a cash advance fee (FINANCE CHARGE) equal to 2% of the cash advance (or $10.00, whichever is greater) will be applied to each cash advance. 



10. 
Method Used to Determine the Balance on Which the FINANCE CHARGE May Be Computed. We .gure the FINANCE CHARGE on your Account by applying the Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of purchases and cash advances for your Account (not including current transactions). To get the �Average Daily Balance� we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid FINANCE CHARGES and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the �Average Daily Balance.� 

11. 
Method of Determining the Amount of the FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE imposed on purchases and cash advances with respect to a Billing Cycle, will be determined by multi�plying the Average Daily Balance of purchases and cash advances by the number of days in the Billing Cycle and then by the rate disclosed in the next paragraph. The FINANCE CHARGE for any Billing Cycle will be the sum of the FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and the FINANCE CHARGE for cash advances. However, the portion of your balance that is the result of purchases has a different treatment if you pay all of that portion by at least twenty .ve (25 days) after we send your billing statement. In 


that event, we will zero out the FINANCE CHARGE that would otherwise be charged on that portion of your account balance. For this purpose, payments will be applied .rst to unpaid FINANCE CHARGES, then to unpaid purchases and cash advances from prior billing statements (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate), then to purchases and cash advances during that Billing Cycle (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest rate). 
12. (a) Purchases. Periodic Rate and Corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The Periodic Rate that is used to compute the FINANCE CHARGE and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is variable, and will change based on changes in an index, which is the Prime Rate quoted on the 15th day of the last month of the prior quarter as published in The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition).We add a margin of 4.99 percentage points to the index to obtain the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE includes only interest and not other costs. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is divided by 365 to produce the daily Periodic Rate. The Periodic Rate and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that will apply to your Account will be disclosed on the notice that accompanies (and is a part of) this Agreement when you open your Account. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will in no event be higher than 18%, or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law, or fall below 5.99% over the life of the credit line. The rate will be adjusted on the twenty .rst day of each calendar quarter (January 21, April 21, July 21, and October 21). 
12. 
(b).Cash Advances. The Daily Periodic Rate for cash advances (including balance transfers) is .046547%, with a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 16.99%. 

13. 
Conditions Under Which Other Charges May Be Imposed. We may impose the following fees and charges on your Account: 

a. 
Annual Fee. There is no annual fee. 

b. 
Cash Advance Fee. The fee for a cash advance is the greater of 2.00% of the cash advance amount or $5.00. 

c. 
Late Fee. A late fee of $25 will be imposed when any payment is 15 days past due.. 

d. 
Miscellaneous Photocopying. If you request a copy of a sales draft or other document, we may charge your Account $5.00 per copy and $25.00 per hour for research. These charges cover the costs of locating, copying, and delivering the documents to you. If a request is related to a billing error and an error is found, we will reverse any photocopying charges. 




e.Overlimit Fee. A fee of $29 will be imposed in any Billing Cycle in which the outstand�ing balance (including unpaid FINANCE CHARGES) exceeds your credit limit at any time. 
f. 
Replacement Card Charge. 	A $5.00 charge per card will be imposed for each replacement card you request, regardless of the reason. 

g. 
Returned Check Charge. A $25.00 charge will be imposed for each check returned to us for insuf.cient funds or Account closure. 

h. 
Convenience Check Stop Payment. 	A $17.00 charge will be imposed for each convenience check stop payment request. 

i. 
ATM Surcharges. If you use an ATM that is not operated by us, you may be charged an ATM surcharge by the ATM operator or an ATM network utilized for such a transac�tion. The ATM surcharge will be charged to your account if you elect to complete  the transaction. 

j. 
Fees and Costs. We may pay someone else to help collect your Account if you do not pay. You agree to pay us all costs to collect your Account, including court costs, reasonable attorney fees and costs, and collection agency costs,if applicable, whether or not there is a lawsuit, and fees on any appeal and fees for bankruptcy proceedings, appeals,andanypost judgmentcollectionservices,ifapplicable.

14. 	Security Interest. To secure your Account, you grant us a purchase money security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code in any goods you purchase through your Account. If you default, we will have the right to recover any of these goods which have not been paid for through application of your payments in the manner described in Section 7.

DISCLOSURE AND AGREEMENT OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS GOVERNING THE USE OF YOUR CARD

In this agreement, the words ""you"", ""your"", and/or ""Cardholder(s)"" refers to the person whose name is embossed in the face of the MasterCard(r) 
Platinum, MasterCard Platinum Cash and MasterCard Platinum Rewards credit card (""Card"" or ""credit card"") enclosed herewith, and each 
Cardholder, in the event more than one Card is enclosed bearing the same account number (""Account"").  The words ""CFE"" and/or ""Issuer"" refer to 
Central Florida Educators' Federal Credit Union.  This Agreement replaces all prior Agreements between Cardholder and CFE.

Before using your Card, please review this Agreement carefully.  By signing or using any Card that is enclosed with this document or that may be 
issued to you and/or to any Cardholder you authorize, you agree that you understand and will comply with all of the terms and conditions pertaining 
to the use of such card established by CFE's Board of Directors and disclosed to you in this Agreement. CFE reserves the right to amend this 
Agreement at any time and for any reason.  CFE shall send you written notice thereof, mailed to you at your last known address.  Any changes in 
these terms, including, without limitation, changes in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) and the Periodic Rate, shall be effective with respect to 
any balances then outstanding to the extent allowable by law as well as to future Credit Purchases and Cash Advances.  For example, CFE may 
change the terms based on information in your credit report; APRs may change to higher APRs, fixed APRs may change to variable APRs, or variable 
APRs may change to fixed APRs. Any changes will be in accordance with your account agreement.

In the event you do not wish to comply with these terms and conditions for any reason, you understand that you may terminate this agreement and 
return the credit card to CFE. Cardholder acknowledges receiving from Issuer the initial disclosures required by Regulation Z of the Truth-In-Lending 
Act (""Initial Disclosures"") and agrees that the terms contained in the initial Disclosures apply to Cardholder and Cardholder's use of the Card.

CFE will establish a line of credit for you and notify you of your credit limit. The credit limit approved shall be determined by the credit union, and 
this credit limit will be drawn upon and replenished as you access the available funds by using an issued credit card, a convenience check, or by 
other means. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount you will have outstanding on your account, at any time, including purchases, 
cash advances, Finance Charges, plus other fees described in this or subsequent disclosures.  If you are over your credit limit, you must pay the 
amount you are over before payments will begin to restore your credit limit.  You may request an increase in your credit limit by a method acceptable 
to the Issuer.  The Issuer has the right to reduce your credit limit, decline any transaction including but not limited to cash advances, and/or 
terminate your Account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law.
 
Using Your Credit Card Account: You may use your card to make purchases from entities that accept credit cards.  You may be required to provide 
card number security information to purchase goods or services via the Internet or telephone before your transaction is completed.  You may use 
your Card to obtain cash advances from CFE, other participating financial institutions, or an automated teller machine (ATM) authorized for such 
transactions. Use of your Card to obtain cash advance(s) from an ATM requires use of the Personal Identification Number (PIN) that is issued to you 
for use with this Card. Note that some ATMs do not allow cash advances or accept MasterCard. You agree not to use your Card to conduct any illegal 
transaction per applicable federal, state, or local law, including, but not limited to, using the card to initiate any type of gambling or wagering where 
such practices are in violation of federal, state, or local law. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions you initiate 
by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.

Issuer shall not be responsible for refusal by any entity to honor the Card or any related Card.  Any refund, adjustment or credit allowed shall not be 
by cash but rather by a credit advice to Issuer which shall be shown as a credit on Cardholder's account statement with Issuer.

Security Precautions: CFE Federal Credit Union advises all check card and credit cardholders to please exercise discretion when using an 
Automated Teller Machine (ATM). There are risks of using a PIN at an ATM terminal that has been modified, has a suspicious device attached, may 
not be genuine, or is otherwise operating in a suspicious manner. Therefore, please tell us if you know of any problem with a facility. For instance, 
let us know if a light is not working or there is any damage to a facility. Report any suspicious activity or crimes to both the operator of the facility 
and the local law enforcement officials immediately. We want the ATM and night deposit facility to be safe and convenient for you. 

Additional Benefits/Card Enhancements: CFE may, from time to time, offer additional services or benefits to your Account, such as travel 
insurance, rewards points which may be redeemed for travel, gift certificates or merchandise, cash rebates, or other benefits.  Such benefits shall be 
provided at no additional cost to you.  CFE reserves the right to limit the number of points or the amount of cash rebates or other benefits at any 
time without notice. You understand and agree that CFE is under no obligation to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.

Your Responsibility: You agree that you are liable for and will pay CFE all charges (purchases, cash advances) to your account made by you or 
anyone else who is authorized to use your credit card Account (including all Cards bearing the same MasterCard account number).  You shall be liable 
and agree to pay Issuer for Credit Purchases made by, or for Cash Advances extended to, Cardholder or anyone else using such Card unless the use 
of such Card is by a person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, implied or apparent authority for such use, and (b) from which 
Cardholder receives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally liable and agrees to pay for all Credit Purchases and Loans 
obtained through the use of any other Card bearing Cardholder's account number that has been issued to another person by reason of such person 
by being a member of Cardholder's family, or otherwise issued upon Cardholder's request (all such Cards bearing the same MasterCard account 
number hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). In addition, you agree to pay all Finance Charges and other charges added to your Account 
under the terms of this Disclosure and Agreement and any other applicable Agreement you have made with CFE.  You undertake to safeguard the 
Card against damage, loss, theft or misuse and to maintain it at all times in a safe place. You will be responsible for any loss, claim or damage 
resulting from your failure to do so.

Young members: The Credit Card Act restricts CFE's ability to provide young members with credit cards who are under the age of 21. In order to 
issue credit cards to such members, the application will have to: 1) include the signature of a consignor, guarantor, or joint applicant who has 
attained the age of 21 and has the means to repay the debts incurred; or 2) include financial information indicating that the underage member has 
the ability to repay the debts incurred.  Future credit line increases will follow the above requirements.

Returns and Adjustments: All credit purchases and cash advances are affected at the option of the merchant and/or cash advancing financial 
institution. Any refund, adjustment or credit allowed by any entity will be made by a credit advice to Issuer which will be applied as a credit on your 
account statement.  If your credits and payments exceed what you owe on your Account, the amount will be applied against future purchases and/or 
cash advances.  If your credit balance exceeds $1, you may request a refund by writing to us at:  CFE Federal Credit Union, Attn: Card Services, PO 
Box 958471, Lake Mary, Florida  32795-8471, Phone: 407-896-9411, outside Orlando 1-800-771-9411, option 3.

Credit Limit: By using the card, you acknowledge that you applied for a credit card to use from time to time and which may be replenished by 
payment on amounts previously drawn.  The credit limit will be determined by the Issuer, and will be drawn upon as you utilize the Account.  You 
agree not to use your Card or permit the use of your Account to obtain credit purchases or loans which will increase your credit card indebtedness to 
us to an amount in excess of the established limit. 

Statements and Notices: CFE will send you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union, at monthly intervals determined by us, a 
statement reflecting all Account activity for the prior period (""cycle""), including purchases, cash advances, fees, and payments.  Additional notices 
and information may be sent to you at any time.  Such statements, notices, and information will be sent to the most recent mailing address you have 
provided to the Credit Union.  Notice sent to any one authorized user on the Account will constitute notice sent to all authorized users.  Unless you 
notify us in writing within 60 days of the mailing of each statement, the statement will be deemed correct and accepted by you and all authorized 
users of the Account.  

Payment: You agree to pay at least the minimum required payment amount shown on your statement by the date shown on the statement or no 
later than twenty-five (25) days from the statement closing date, whichever is later.  You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum 
payment, or repay the Total New Balance in full at your option without penalty. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make 
at least the minimum payment each month your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The required MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 
will be the greater of:  a) $20 or b) 3% of the portion of the outstanding balance which does not exceed your credit limit, plus the entire portion of 
the outstanding balance in excess of your credit limit, plus any amount past due.  If the outstanding balance of your account is $20 or less, it will be 
payable in full.  CFE may accept checks marked ""Payment in Full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of our rights to collect the full 
balance of your account. Except where prohibited by law, satisfaction of your account balance for less than the New Balance requires written 
agreement signed by one of our authorized employees.

Payment Allocation:  Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and 
any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order from the highest APR based on the applicable APR in accordance with law. Any 
payments less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be applied at our discretion. You may no longer direct us how to apply your payment 
among your account types or on balances within your account types.

Default: You will be in default under any of the following circumstances:  1) if you fail to make any minimum payment or other payment required by 
the Issuer on or before the date it is due or if you attempt to in any way avoid payment of your obligations; 2) if you violate any portion of your 
responsibility or promise you made under this agreement; 3) if you file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, meaning you are unable to pay your 
obligations when they are due or if attachment or garnishment proceedings are instituted against you; 4) if you made any false or misleading 
statements in any credit application; 5) if you provided false identification or records in connection with any credit application or credit update; 6) in 
the event of your death; 7) if you incur charges for Purchases and Cash Advances which exceed the maximum authorized credit limit; and/or 8) if the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, believes your ability to repay what you owe may be substantially reduced due to an event either within or beyond your 
control. Failure by Issuer to assert any rights hereunder shall not waive such rights. 

When you are in default, the Issuer may demand immediate payment of your Account balance in full without giving you prior notice.  If immediate 
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying Finance Charges at the annual percentage rate established for this account by the Issuer, until 
the entire balance has been paid.  Any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe the Issuer.  

Security Interest: You agree that this account is secured by all share and deposit accounts that you have or may have with CFE and that 
collateral pledged for other loans you have with this credit union will also secure your obligation under this agreement. However, unless you 
expressly agree otherwise, your IRA's, household goods and primary dwelling will not secure your obligations under this agreement even if the 
Issuer has or later acquires a security interest in the household goods or a mortgage on the dwelling. This security interest shall continue as 
long as you have your credit card account even if there is no outstanding balance on your account from time to time. You agree that if you do not 
make your credit card account payments on time, or if the balance on your Account exceeds your credit limit, CFE may, without notice to you, take 
funds from one or more of your share accounts to apply to the payment of this Account, and interests and costs, if delinquent and/or over the 
credit limit.

Interest: Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the Finance Charge calculation method referred to in the 
Disclosure box. The rate of interest will be established by Issuer from time to time and will not exceed the maximum rate of 17.75% APR.  The current 
interest rate per annum is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) set forth in the Disclosure box below.

Variable Rate Information: Your APR will vary. The rate for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers is determined by Prime Rate (Wall 
Street Journal Index). The Wall Street Journal Index is published in the consumer rates table of the Wall Street Journal on the 15th of each month (or 
the next business day if not published on the 15th) effective with your billing statement the following month.

Termination of this Agreement: CFE may terminate this agreement under the following conditions: a) upon adverse re-evaluation of your credit 
worthiness; b) if you fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement; and/or c) at your option or our option, if we have good cause.  If your credit card 
Account is to be terminated by the Issuer, you will receive written notice of such termination as applicable by law; however, you understand and 
acknowledge that such termination will not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance, Finance Charge, and fees.  The Card(s) issued to 
you for this Account remain the property of the Issuer.   

Card Ownership and Surrender Rules: Each Card is the property of CFE is not transferable and must be surrendered upon demand. The card can 
be cancelled as well as repossessed by CFE or its designee, and the privileges revoked, at any time without prior notice.  If the card is cancelled or 
surrender is demanded by Issuer, or if you default in any payment due, or if you are bankrupt or insolvent, or any attachment or garnishment 
proceedings are initiated against you or your property, or in the event of your death, CFE may elect to declare all amounts then owed to be 
immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. 

Reapplication: A reapplication by you and approval by the Issuer may be required if: a) the credit limit is increased; or b) the terms of payment are 
extended beyond the terms of the original agreement.

Delinquent loans: You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if your loans with us become delinquent or past due, your credit card Account 
shall be revoked, unless we determine that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency.  Under such circumstances we reserve the 
right to approve your continued use of the credit card.

Enforcing obligations: You agree to pay all costs incurred by CFE in collecting your debt or in enforcing this agreement, including reasonable 
attorney's fees and also those costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post-judgment proceedings, except to the 
extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law.  Should the Issuer employ or engage the services of any entity to enforce any of your 
obligations relating to this agreement, or to protect its interests in any manner arising under this agreement, you agree to pay to CFE all reasonable 
costs or expenses incurred as a result. 

Communications: You agree that we, our agents or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone communications or electronic 
communications with you.  

Credit Review and Release of Information: CFE reserves the right to reinvestigate and reevaluate any information you provided on your credit 
application at anytime. In the course of doing so, we may ask you for additional information, request credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify 
your current credit standing. Effective February 1, 2011, due to federal regulations CFE is required to review your account not less 
frequently than once every six months to reassess your credit worthiness and adjust your APR accordingly, if necessary. You agree that 
we may release information to others, such as credit bureaus, regarding the status and history of your account. However, we are not obligated to 
release any such information to anyone unless required by law to do so.

Laws of the State: Except to the extent that Federal law is applicable, the validity, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all matters 
arising out
of the issuance and use of the Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.  You understand and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of 
the State of Florida and that the exclusive venue for any action or dispute shall be in the courts of Orange County, Florida.

Final Agreement / No Waiver: This Disclosure and Agreement is the definitive agreement between you and the Issuer and may not be 
contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.  The Issuer can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

MasterCard Rules: You agree that your Account shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations of MasterCard International, as applicable, 
as well as all applicable laws. If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and regulations of MasterCard 
International, the rules and regulations of MasterCard International shall control.

Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the 
consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge 
of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Cash advance fees are Finance Charges. Foreign transaction fees are not Finance 
Charges.          
    
Balance Computation Method: Average daily balance method (including current transactions). We figure the interest charge on your account by 
applying the periodic rate to the ""average daily balance"" of your account. To get the ""average daily balance"" we take the beginning balance of your 
account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other Finance Charges and] any payments or 
credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the 
billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance.""

Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Methods: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a Finance Charge for 
that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle's 
billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a Finance Charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your 
account. To avoid an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date of that statement. A Finance Charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first 
day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 

The Finance Charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the Finance Charge is computed by applying the 
monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding 
balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. 
Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This 
gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

Method of Computing Cash Advances: The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the 
AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number 
of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances any new Cash 
Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later and subtracting any payments as received 
and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charge.

Balance Transfers: Balance transfers must be transferred from any financial institution other than CFE. Balance transfers and cash advances may 
not be used to pay any CFE accounts. Balance transfers are treated as and considered cash advances on your account. Amounts transferred are 
subject to your available credit limit. We are not required to honor a balance transfer request that will cause you to exceed your available credit limit. 
We will not be responsible for late payment or non-payment to other card issuers. We are not responsible for fees that may be charged for cash 
advances performed at other financial institutions and ATMs owners. There is no grace period for balance transfers.
It may take up to three (3) weeks for other financials to post the balance transfer transaction. You should continue to make all required payments 
until you confirm that the balance transfer was posted to the other financial institution. We will not close your other accounts even if you transfer the 
entire balance. If you wish to close another account, you should contact the issuer directly. 

Balance transfers and cash advances do not qualify to earn bonus points on the MasterCard Platinum Cash and MasterCard Platinum Rewards 
accounts.

Other Fees May Apply to the Account: Additional charges, plus applicable taxes, may also be assessed on the account.  Such fees are added to 
the balance of the Account and will be notated on your statement.  Fees will not be included in any Finance Charge calculation. Use of the card 
constitutes your understanding of an agreement to the following Fee Schedule:

Late Payment Warning: If we do not receive your minimum payment by the date listed on your statement you may have to pay a late 
payment fee of $15 on balances less than $500 and $25* for balances over $499.  Your APR(s) may be increased up to the Penalty APR of 
17.75%.  *The late payment fee for balances over $499 will be based on the greater amount of $20 or 3% of the outstanding balance not to 
exceed $25.

Penalty APR: Each time your account becomes 60 days past due, the Penalty APR will apply to all account balances. Any 
Promotional or Introductory APR will end and the Penalty APR will begin on the first day of the billing period. After you have 
made all the required payments on time for six consecutive billing periods, the Annual Percentage Rate will be reduced to the 
regular account APR beginning the first day of your next billing period. The change to your Penalty APR applies to all existing 
and future balances on your account.

Returned Check or Rejected Payment: If you pay us electronically or by check and your financial institution does not honor 
the payment or check, a fee of $25 will apply.

Over-the-credit-limit: If at any time your account balance is over your credit limit a fee will not be charged.  

Special Services: CFE reserves the right to charge a fee for Special Services that you request, if such charges are not prohibited 
by law or regulation. No Finance Charge will be assessed on such additional charges.  For example, a $5 fee applies for each 
copy of a document that you request (except when the request is made in connection with the investigation of a billing error 
made by the Issuer).  You may be charged $5 if you order a replacement card. The fee for other Special Services, if applicable, 
will be disclosed to you prior to processing the request. Additionally, there will be a $20 per hour or $5 minimum research fee. 
No charge will be made in connection with any good faith assertion of a billing error on the account.

Liability for Unauthorized Use: If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of your credit card or related 
cards, you should write to us immediately at: PSCU Financial Services, Credit Card Security Department, PO Box 31281, Tampa, FL 33631-3281 or call 
us at (800) 449-7728. You may also contact us on the Web: www.pscufs.com. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you 
notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.

Unauthorized Use - MasterCard: You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your MasterCard credit card. If you believe that your card has 
been lost, stolen, or an unauthorized use has occurred, notify PSCU Financial Services - Credit Card Security Department immediately at 800-449-
7728. If you have exercised reasonable care in safeguarding your card from loss or theft, you have not reported two or more incidents of 
unauthorized use in the last 12 months, and if your account is in good standing, you will not be liable for any unauthorized purchases made with your 
card after you notify us. If you don't meet these conditions, or if the unauthorized use occurred at an ATM, your liability will not exceed $50.

Foreign Transactions and Currency Conversion: For MasterCard, if you effect a transaction with your MasterCard in a currency other 
than U.S. dollars, MasterCard International Incorporated will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard International 
will use its currency conversion procedure, which is disclosed to institutions that issue MasterCard cards. Currently the currency 
conversion rate used by MasterCard International to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars for such transactions is 
generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by MasterCard International for the processing cycle in 
which the transaction is processed, increased by an adjustment factor established from time to time by MasterCard International. The 
currency conversion rate used by MasterCard International on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been 
used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. You agree to pay the converted amount in U.S. dollars, plus any 
charge for conversion or processing that may be imposed by the Issuer, plus any charge that may be imposed for an international 
transaction, regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion. The 1% International Service Assessment fee applies to all 
international transactions regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion.

Protected Balances Due to Rate Increases: Protected balances are the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an 
increased annual percentage rate cannot be applied after the rate for that category of transactions has been increased.

Annual Fee: No annual fee applies to this credit card.

Illegal Use and Internet Gambling: You agree that all transactions that you initiate by use of your card are legal in the jurisdiction where you live 
and/or where the transaction occurred. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located, including the United States. Your 
card may only be used for legal transactions. Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not mean that internet gambling 
transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which you may be located. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions 
you initiate by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.



USA Patriot Act: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: When you open an account at 
CFE, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's 
license or other identifying documents.

Right To Reject Change In Terms: A member may reject a significant change in terms by calling (407) 896-9411 or (800) 771-9411, option 3 or by 
mailing us at: CFE Federal Credit Union, Attn: Card Services, PO Box 958471, Lake Mary, FL 32795-8471, but in doing so you will forego any credit 
availability for the account and the account will be terminated or suspended. The balance on the account is the balance at the end of the day on which 
credit availability is terminated or suspended. CFE will establish an amortization period required by law for the balance on the account beginning no 
earlier than the date on which CFE was notified of the rejection. The right to reject a change in terms does not apply if CFE has not received a 
member's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for that payment.

DELTA COMMUNITY GOLD VISA
CONSUMER CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT In this Agreement, �Agreement� means this Consumer Credit Card Agreement. �Disclosure� means the Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement.
1.	USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor.
You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. 
2.	USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery tickets, and casino gaming chips, as applicable. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal.
3.	PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account.
4.	PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement. 
5.	FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later.
The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 
For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To get the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. Then, we add all the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances.
6.	FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date.
A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates.
7.	FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
a.	Cash Advance Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Cash Advance Fee (finance charge), the fee may be charged for ATM withdrawals and transfers made from your card to any deposit account through Online Banking and Audio Line.  Overdraft transfers are excluded.  A cash advance fee may be initially charged for balance transfers initiated to pay off non-Delta Community Credit Union accounts but will be credited back to your Visa account. 
b.	Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency. 
c.	Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
d.	Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when a payment is returned to you for any reason.
e.	Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the credit union, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request.
f.	Document Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Document Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request (except when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union).
g.	Rush Fee. If your account is subject to a Rush Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each rush card that you request, providing delivery of the card is also available by standard mail service, without paying a fee for delivery.
h.	Stop Payment Fee. If your account is subject to the Stop Payment Fee, a fee will be charged to your account as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
i.	Visa Convenience Checks Fee. If your account is subject to the Visa Convenience Checks Fee, a fee will be charged to your account as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
j.	Over-the-Credit Limit Fee. If you have elected the feature to allow your account to go over your credit limit, we may charge you a fee as allowed by law. However, in no case will we impose an over-the-limit fee except in the next two billing cycles unless you have obtained an additional extension of credit in excess of such credit limit during each subsequent cycle or you have reduced the balance below the credit limit as of the end of each bill cycle.
8.	PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 3.00% of your total new balance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, and any amount you are over your credit limit. In addition to the minimum payment, you must also pay, by the date specified above, the amount of any prior minimum payment(s) that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. 
9.	PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate. 
10.	SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. 
Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default.
Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement. 
11.	DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe.
When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe.
12.	LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION � You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at 1025 Virginia Ave, Atlanta GA 30354 or telephone 800-544-3328 seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.
13.	CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT � As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions.
Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized.
The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account. 
14.	CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS � Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user. If you cannot return the authorized user's card or access checks and if you request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for a new account.
15.	CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION � You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. If your account is eligible for emergency cash and/or emergency card replacement services, and you request such services, you agree that we may provide personal information about you and your account that is necessary to provide you with the requested service(s).
16.	RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS � Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6) months.
17.	ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS � The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit Union is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.
18.	MERCHANT DISPUTES � The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home.
19.	JOINT ACCOUNTS � If this is a joint account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may terminate the account and the termination will be effective as to all of you.
20.	EFFECT OF AGREEMENT � This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.
21.	NO WAIVER � The Credit Union can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.
22.	STATEMENTS AND NOTICES � Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the appropriate address you have given the Credit Union. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all.

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement
If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:
Delta Community Credit Union
1025 Virginia Ave
Atlanta, GA 30354-1319
You may also contact us on the Web: www.deltacommunitycu.com
In your letter, give us the following information:
* Account information: Your name and account number.
* Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
* Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us:
* Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
* At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
	1.	Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
	2.	Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. 
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
* We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
* The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
* While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
* We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
* If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
* If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. 
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.

Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
	1.	The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
	2.	You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
	3.	You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing [or electronically] at:
Delta Community Credit Union
1025 Virginia Ave
Atlanta, GA 30354-1319
www.deltacommunitycu.com
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

All of your obligations under this Agreement, including any INTEREST CHARGES, are owed to the Credit Union. The word �account� means any number of VISA Gold, VISA Platinum, MasterCard Gold, and/or MasterCard Platinum accounts established for you under this Agreement. �Use of this card� means any procedure used by you, or someone authorized by you, to make a purchase or obtain a cash advance whether or not the purchase or advance is evidenced by a signed written document. �Unauthorized� use of the card� means that use of the card by someone other than you who does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and from which you receive no benefit.
SECURITY INTEREST AND PLEDGE OF SHARES: YOU PLEDGE TO US AND GRANT TO US A CONSENSUAL SECURITY INTEREST IN ALL INDIVIDUAL AND JOINT ACCOUNTS MAINTAINED WITH US IN WHICH YOU HAVE INTEREST NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, EXCEPT AMOUNTS HELD IN AN IRA OR KEOGH PLAN, TO SECURE REPAYMENT OF AMOUNTS OWING UNDER THIS CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT, TOGETHER WITH ANY FEES OR COSTS WHICH MAY BE ASSESSED AGAINST THE ACCOUNT UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE GRANTING OF THIS SECURITY INTEREST IS A CONDITION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF ANY CARD THAT YOU MAY USE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO OBTAIN EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE IN DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AUTHORIZE US TO APPLY ANY AND ALL AMOUNTS ON DEPOSIT IN ANY ACCOUNT IN WHICH YOU HAVE AN INTEREST NOW OR IN THE FUTURE TO THE PAYMENT OF ALL AMOUNTS OWING UNDER THIS CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT.
Additional Security: If you have other loans with us, now or in the future, collateral securing such loans may also secure your obligations under this Agreement. This security interest does not apply to Home Equity loans, or any other dwelling-secured loan. Please read any security agreement you sign in order to determine if the collateral also secures your obligations under this Agreement and any other agreements you have with us.
1) Extensions of Credit. If your application is approved, the Credit Union may, at its discretion, establish a credit card account in your name and cause one or more cards to be issued to you or those designated by you. In such event, you authorize the Credit Union to pay for your account, all items reflecting credit purchases and cash advances obtained through use of the card. The Credit Union, may at its discretion, issue checks to you which may be used for any purpose other than making a payment for credit to your account. Any check written by you will be considered as a cash advance, even if used to make a purchase. By signing such a check, you authorize the Credit Union to pay the item for the amount indicated and post such amounts as cash advance to your account. The Credit Union does not have to pay any item which would cause the outstanding balance in your account to exceed your credit limit. Please refer to the attached Rate and Fee Disclosures for charges that apply in connection with credit card convenience checks. 
2) Joint Applicant Liability. If this Agreement is executed by more than one person, each of you shall be jointly and individually liable to us for all charges made to the account, including applicable fees. In addition, you agree that each of you designates the other as agent for the purpose of making purchases extended under this Agreement and each use of your account shall be an extension of credit to all. Notice to one of you shall constitute notice to all. Any joint cardholder may remove him/herself from responsibility for future purchases at any time by notifying us in writing. However, removal from the account does not release the joint cardholder from any liability already incurred.
3) Others Using Your Account. If you allow anyone else to use your card, you will be liable for all credit extended to such persons. You promise to pay for all purchases, balance transfers, and cash advances made by anyone whom you authorize to use your card, whether or not you notify us that he or she will be using it. If someone else is authorized to use your card and you want to end that person�s privilege, you must notify us in writing, and if he or she has a card, you must return the card with your written notice for it to be effective.
4) Credit Limits. You promise the payments made for your account resulting from use of the card will, at no time, cause the outstanding balance in your account to exceed your credit limit as disclosed to you at the time you receive your card or as adjusted from time to time at the discretion of the Credit Union.
5) Promise To Pay. You promise to repay the Credit Union all payments made for your account resulting from use of the card, plus INTEREST CHARGES on the unpaid balance. At the end of each monthly billing cycle, you will be furnished with a periodic statement showing (1) the �previous balance� (the outstanding balance in the account at the beginning of the billing cycle), (2) the amount of all cash advances, balance transfers, purchases and INTEREST CHARGES posted to your account during the billing cycle, (3) the amount of all payments and credits posted to your account during the billing cycle, and (4) the �new balance� which is the sum of (1) and (2) less (3). You agree to pay on or before the �payment due date� shown on the periodic statement either the entire �new balance�, or a minimum payment equal to 3% of the �new balance�, or $18.00, whichever is greater, if the �new balance� is $18.00 or less, you will pay in full.
6) Cost of Credit. You will pay INTEREST CHARGES for all advances made against your account. INTEREST CHARGES for cash advances and balance transfers begin to accrue on the date of the advance. New purchases will not incur an INTEREST CHARGE on the date they are posted to your account if you have paid the account in full by the �payment due date� shown on your most recent monthly statement, or if there was no previous balance.
If your account features an introductory rate, you will pay a fixed introductory rate for all advances made against your VISA Gold, MasterCard Gold, VISA Platinum, or MasterCard Platinum account at the daily periodic rate and corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) set forth in the Rate Disclosure attached to this Agreement. Any introductory rate applicable to your account applies until the first day of the billing cycle that includes the six-month anniversary date of the opening of your account.
Thereafter, your account is subject to a variable rate, and the APR may increase. The applicable periodic rate used to compute the INTEREST CHARGES for all advances is based on an index (the �Index�), which is the Prime Rate as published in the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal on the 10th day of the month and is subject to change monthly. If the 10th falls on a weekend or a holiday in any given month, then we will use the Prime Rate published on the next business day for that month. Any change in the Index will be effective on the first day of the billing cycle in the month following the date of the change. An increase in the Index may result in an increase in the periodic rate, which in turn, may result in higher payments. We retain the discretion not to increase your rate when the Index increases, but such action does not preclude us from increasing the rate in step with Index increases on future occasions. 
We will add a margin to the Index to determine your daily periodic rate and corresponding APR. The margin for VISA Gold, MasterCard Gold, VISA Platinum, and MasterCard Platinum accounts is set forth in the Rate Disclosure attached to this Agreement. 
The daily periodic rates and corresponding APRs for VISA Gold, MasterCard Gold, VISA Platinum, and MasterCard Platinum accounts are set forth in the Rate Disclosure attached to this Agreement. The maximum rate for all accounts will never exceed a daily periodic rate of .049315%, which corresponds to an APR of 18%.
The INTEREST CHARGE is figured by applying the periodic rate to the �balance subject to INTEREST CHARGE� which is the �average daily balance� of your account, including certain current transactions. The �average daily balance� is arrived at by taking the beginning balance of your account each day, adding in any new cash advances and balance transfers, and unless you pay your account in full by the �payment due date� shown on the previous monthly statement or there is no previous balance, adding in new purchases, and subtracting any payments or credits and unpaid INTEREST CHARGES. This gives us the daily balance. The daily balances for the billing cycle are then added together and divided by the number of days in the billing cycle. The result is the �average daily balance.� The INTEREST CHARGE is determined by multiplying the �average daily balance� by the number of days in the billing cycle and applying the periodic rate to the product.
No additional INTEREST CHARGES will be incurred whenever you pay the account in full by the �payment due date� as reflected on your most recent monthly statement. The �payment due date� is not less than 25 days from the billing cycle closing date shown on your statement. You may pay any amounts outstanding at any time without penalty for early repayment.
7) Other Charges. Please refer to the attached Rate and Fee Disclosures for other charges that apply in connection with your credit card account.
8) Credit Insurance. Credit life and/or credit disability insurance is optional. If you qualify for and purchase the insurance from us, you authorize us to add the insurance premiums monthly to your loan balance and charge you interest on the entire balance. If you elect credit insurance, your payments may increase or the period of time necessary to repay your advance may be extended. The credit insurance rates may change. If the rates change, we will provide any notices required by applicable law.
9) Visa Card Liability for Unauthorized Use. If you notice the loss or theft of your VISA card or a possible unauthorized use of your VISA card, you should call the Credit Card Center immediately at:
(800) 442-4757
Under VISA�s zero liability policy, you will not be liable for unauthorized use of your VISA card once you notify us orally or in writing of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. The foregoing zero liability policy does not apply if you are grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handling of your account or your VISA card, nor does it apply in the case of cash advances obtained at an ATM. 
You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.
10) MasterCard Liability for Unauthorized Use. If you notice the loss or theft of your MasterCard or a possible unauthorized use of your MasterCard, you should call the Credit Card Center immediately at:
(800) 442-4757
Under MasterCard�s zero liability policy, you will not be liable for any unauthorized use of your MasterCard once you notify us orally or in writing of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use and you meet the following conditions: (1) you have exercised reasonable care with the MasterCard; (2) you have not reported two or more incidents of unauthorized use of the MasterCard within the previous 12 months; and (3) you have maintained your account in good standing. The foregoing zero liability policy does not apply to cash advances obtained at an ATM. 
You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.
11) Crediting Payments. All payments on your account will be applied first to collection costs, then to any INTEREST CHARGES and other fees due, and then to the unpaid principal balance. All payments made on your account at the address designated for payment on the monthly periodic statement or at any of our branch offices during our business hours will be credited to your account on the date of receipt. If we receive a payment on a day that is not a business day for us or at a time that we are not open, your payment may be credited on the first business day following receipt. Interest paid or agreed to be paid shall not exceed the maximum amount permissible under applicable law, and in any contingency whatsoever, if we shall receive anything of value deemed interest under applicable law which would exceed the maximum amount of interest permissible under applicable law, the excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal amount or refunded to you.
12) Default. You will be in default: (1) if you fail to make any payment on time; (2) if you fail to keep any promises you have made under this or any other agreement with the Credit Union; (3) if you are the subject of an order for relief Under Title 11 of the U.S. Code (Bankruptcy); (4) if anyone tries, by legal process, to take any of your money in the Credit Union; (5) if you have given the Credit Union false or inaccurate information in obtaining your card, or (6) if anything happens which the Credit Union reasonably believes endangers your ability to repay what you owe.
13) Acceleration. If you are in default; the Credit Union may, without prior notice to you, call any amounts you still owe immediately due and payable plus INTEREST CHARGES which shall continue to accrue until the entire amount is paid. You expressly waive any right to notice of demand, including but not limited to, demand upon default, notice of intention to accelerate, and notice of acceleration. The card remains the property of the Credit Union at all times, and you agree to immediately surrender the card upon demand of the Credit Union. You agree to pay all reasonable costs of collection, including court costs and attorney�s fees imposed and any cost incurred in the recovery of the card.
14) Termination or Changes. The Credit Union may add to, delete, or change the terms of this Agreement from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any INTEREST CHARGES and other charges you owe under this Agreement. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized. The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the 
 Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. The Credit Union has the right to require you to pay off your full account balance at any time after your account is terminated, whether it is terminated by you or the Credit Union.
15) Unlawful Transactions. Your Credit Union credit card account(s) may not be used for any illegal or unlawful transactions. You agree that we may decline to process any transaction that we believe in good faith to be for an illegal purpose. You agree that we will not be liable for declining to process any such transaction. If we do process any transaction that ultimately is determined to have been for an illegal purpose, you agree that you will remain liable to us under this Agreement for any such transaction notwithstanding its illegal nature. You agree that any illegal use of the card will be deemed an act of default under this Agreement. You further agree to waive any right to take legal action against us for your illegal use of the card and to indemnify, defend, and hold us and VISA International, Inc. and MasterCard International, Inc. harmless from and against any lawsuits, other legal action, or liability that results directly or indirectly from such illegal use.
16) International Transactions.
MasterCard Cards: If you effect an international transaction with your MasterCard, MasterCard International will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard International will use its currency conversion procedure, which is disclosed to institutions that issue MasterCard cards. Currently, the currency conversion rate used by MasterCard International to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars for such transactions is generally either a government-mandated exchange rate or a wholesale exchange rate selected by MasterCard International for the applicable currency on the day the transaction is processed, which rate may differ from the applicable rate on the date the transaction occurred or when the transaction is posted to your account. We will charge a Foreign Transaction Fee of up to 1% on all international purchase, cash disbursement, and account credit transactions, even if there is no currency conversion. The Foreign Transaction Fee is a non-periodic finance charge and does not accrue interest. There is no grace period for repayment of international transactions in order to avoid the Foreign Transaction Fee.
VISA Cards: If you effect an international transaction with your VISA Card, the rate of exchange between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing the international transaction will be a rate selected by VISA from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. We will charge a Foreign Transaction Fee of up to 1% on all international purchase, cash disbursement, and account credit transactions, even if there is no currency conversion. The Foreign Transaction Fee is a non-periodic finance charge and does not accrue interest. There is no grace period for repayment of international transactions in order to avoid the Foreign Transaction Fee.
17) Visa Emergency Cash And Emergency Card Replacement Services. If this service is available, you acknowledge that we may provide personal data concerning you to VISA USA, its members, or their respective contractors for the purpose of providing you with VISA Emergency Cash and Emergency Card Replacement Services, and you consent to the release of your information for these purposes.
18) CREDIT INVESTIGATION: In conjunction with your application for credit and, if approved, maintenance of your account, you agree that we have the right to investigate your credit and employment history, to verify your credit references, to request and use credit reports, and to report the way you pay your account to credit bureaus and other interested parties.
19) Fair Credit Reporting Act Notification. We may report the status and payment history of your account to credit reporting agencies each month.

PROMISE TO PAY:

You agree to pay us all amounts owed on your account under this 
Agreement. This includes charges for insurance (you elect), account fees, 
and finance charges as described in this Agreement.

By using or authorizing another agent to use your credit card or credit card 
account, you agree to be responsible for all charges incurred and to be 
bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

You, as Cardholder, will be liable and subsequently agree to pay CCCU for 
credit purchases and loan advances extended to you or any agent using your 
Card unless both of the following apply:

� The person using your card did not have actual, implied, or apparent 
authority from you for such use.

� You received no direct or indirect benefit.

If this is a joint credit card account, you are jointly and severally liable 
for all credit purchases, and loan advances obtained using your card by 
any authorized user. Consequently, each of you, together or individually, 
is responsible for all amounts owed. This applies even if only one of you 
uses the account.

YOUR RIGHT TO CANCEL:

You may cancel your credit card account at any time. If you opt to cancel 
and have an outstanding balance on your card it will be frozen at the current 
APR until paid in full. Payments must be made as required or the account 
will be subject to late fees. 

You also have the right to cancel permission for an authorized user to 
continue to use your credit card, you must notify us in writing and return any 
card(s) issued (cut in half) to or for the authorized user. You will be liable 
for all purchases, cash advances, and account fees created by an authorized 
agent, until we receive the required written notification and card.

If this is a joint account, either owner may request the account be closed. 
We will honor the request without liability to either joint cardholder.

PAYMENTS:

On or before each Payment Due Date, you agree to make a payment. 
The Payment Due Date will be the same date each month. The minimum 
payment amount is 3% of your card account balance (as of the last day of 
the billing cycle), or $10, whichever is greater.

The Credit Union does, however, reserve the right to charge for dishonored 
payment due to insufficient or uncollected funds in accordance with the 
CCCU Fee Schedule.

We can accept late payments, partial payments, payments that are marked 
�payment in full�, or payments with restrictive endorsements, without 
losing any of our rights under this Agreement.

Payment for more than the minimum amount will be accepted as a single 
payment on your CCCU Visa� Platinum Credit Card account for that 
month.

Payments should be mailed and addressed to VISA, P.O. Box 96099, 
Charlotte, NC 28296-0099. Please allow sufficient mailing time for 
payment posting.

Payments may also be made through CCCU Call-24 audio system, CCCU 
Web Site (InfoLink), and at any CCCU branch. Payments made by these 
choices will be posted with that day�s effective date if received by 4pm 
local time.

PRE-AUTHORIZED CARD PAYMENT SERVICE:

You may pre-authorize CCCU to pay your credit card payment from your 
savings or checking account each month in the amounts you have elected 
from the following options:

� The Minimum Payment (3% of the balance on the last day of the 
billing cycle or $10, whichever is greater).

� The total outstanding unpaid balance

� A fixed amount greater than the monthly Minimum Payment.

There are no transfer fees or charges for CCCU pre-authorized payment 
service. 

PAYMENT APPLICATION:

Payment amounts received in excess of Minimum Payment shall be 
applied to card balances bearing the highest rate of interest and then to 
each successive balance bearing the next highest rate of interest, until the 
payment amount is exhausted. 

PERIODIC STATEMENT:

We will send you a monthly statement at least 21 days prior to your Payment 
Due Date (if your account is active) which will indicate your credit limit, 
statement closing date, previous statement balance, payments, purchases, 
cash advances, finance charges, new balance, minimum monthly payment 
and payment due date. In addition, the periodic statement shall include 
a payment warning that specifies the number of months it would take to 
pay the balance making only the minimum balance payment, total interest 
and principal costs associated with paying the balance by making only 
minimum payments, monthly payment amount to pay the balance in 36 
months, and a toll-free number to obtain information on credit counseling. 
Statements will be deemed correct and accepted by Cardholder(s) unless 
CCCU is notified to the contrary in writing within 60 days of statement 
date.

FINANCE CHARGE INTEREST APR:

The Interest Rate used to calculate Finance Charge is a variable rate subject 
to change with the beginning of your August statement cycle each year and 
is indexed to the Wall Street Prime as published in the Wall Street Journal 
for June 30th of each year. A margin rate shall be added to the Prime interest 
rate that is reflective of your FICO score (see Table 1).

FINANCE CHARGE CALCULATION:

Cash Advances / Balance Transfers:

The finance charge on cash advances, (including automated teller machine 
(ATM) and convenience check transactions), and balance transfers are 
calculated according to the following method:

A finance charge will be charged on Cash Advances and Balance Transfers 
from the date of the transaction or from the first day of the billing cycle in 
which the transaction is posted to the account (whichever is later). If not 
paid in full during the same billing cycle as made, the finance charge will 
accrue on the unpaid balance until the billing cycle Closing Date prior to 
the date the entire New Balance is paid in full.

If the New Balance indicated on your statement is paid in full by the 
Payment Due Date, no finance charge will be imposed during the current 
billing cycle for Cash Advances or Balance Transfers made during the 
previous billing cycles.

The Finance Charge, for a billing cycle, is computed by multiplying the 
Monthly Periodic Rate times the average daily Cash Advances or Balance 
Transfers balance. The average daily outstanding balance is calculated 
by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the 
number of days in the cycle. The daily balance is determined by adding 
new Cash Advances or Balance Transfers and subtracting payments or 
credits to the previous day�s balance. Unpaid finance charges are excluded 
in determining the daily balance.

PURCHASES:

The finance charge on Purchases is calculated according to the following 
method:

A finance charge will be imposed on Purchases that you obtain through 
the use of your Card, only if you elect not to pay the entire New Balance 
by the Payment Due Date shown on your monthly statement. The finance 
charge will be calculated on the unpaid balance of previous Purchases 
from the statement closing date and on Purchases made during the current 
billing cycle from the date of posting to the account. The finance charge 
will continue to accrue until the closing date of the billing cycle preceding 
the date on which the entire New Balance is paid in full.

The Finance Charge, for a billing cycle, is computed by multiplying the 
Monthly Periodic Rate times the average daily Purchases balance. The 
average daily outstanding balance is calculated by dividing the sum of the 
daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. 
The daily balance is determined by adding new Purchases and subtracting 
payments and credits to the previous day�s balance. Unpaid finance charges 
are excluded in determining the daily balance.

DEFAULT:

You will be in default on this Agreement if one or more of the following 
occur:

� You fail to make a Minimum Payment by the scheduled Payment Due 
Date.

� You fail to abide by the terms of this Agreement or any other 
agreement you may have with CCCU.

� Your financial or credit status has changed so that your credit 
worthiness has been negatively impacted.

In addition, you will be considered in default of this Agreement if: 

� Cardholder dies

� You declare bankruptcy or insolvency.

� You have an attachment or garnishment proceeding initiated against 
you or your property.

DEFAULT REMEDIES:

If you are in default, CCCU may take one or more of the following 
actions:

� Cancel cards

� Accelerate all amounts owed without notice on demand.

� Require past due payment(s) and fees to be paid immediately.

� Take the past due payment(s) and fees from any deposit account in 
your name.

� Require you to immediately pay all amounts you owe under this 
Agreement.

� Take the amount owed under this Agreement from any deposit 
account in your name.

You understand that any remedy applicable under this agreement is 
extended equally to co-applicant or Guarantor.

If you are in default, you agree to pay all our costs, including attorney�s fees, 
which we incur in any collection efforts or litigation at the trial, bankruptcy 
or appellate level to enforce this Agreement and collect the amount owed.

SKIP PAYMENT OPTION:

From time to time, the Credit Union, at its option and terms, may announce 
an optional feature, which will allow you to skip one or more payments. 
You understand that periodic finance charges will continue to accrue on 
your unpaid balance at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate. At the end 
of the period, the payment terms of this Agreement will be reinstated 
automatically without notice.

CHANGE IN TERMS:

You agree that we, at our sole discretion, may change all terms, including 
annual percentage rates (APRs), line of credit amount, features and fees, 
any time in accordance with our agreement and applicable law. We may 
make changes based on information in your credit report, market conditions, 
business strategies, or for any other reason we may choose. We will provide 
advanced written notice of a change in terms, as required by law. The 
address of record, at the time of a change, will be used for such notice.

The applicable APRs for your card account will be determined based on 
the primary cardholder�s credit score. A credit score is a number based 
on a statistical analysis of a person�s credit files, which represents the 
creditworthiness of that person, which is the likelihood that the person will 
pay their bills. A credit score, known as FICO, is primarily based on credit 
report information, typically from one of the major credit bureaus. FICO 
is a credit score developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. We reserve the right 
to use the FICO score issued by any major credit bureau of our choosing in 
determining an APR.

A review of the card account and the primary cardholder�s credit history 
will be conducted during the second quarter of each calendar year. You 
agree the APRs may be adjusted accordingly based on the credit score 
acquired. This process could result in an increase or decrease to the total 
interest paid on the card account. The new APRs will become effective 
within the quarter following the credit review. The new terms, including 
any increase or decrease to an APR, will only apply to new cash advances 
(including ATM and convenience check transactions), balance transfers, 
and purchases. Existing balance shall remain at the existing APR until paid 
in full. Refer to Table 1 for FICO matrix.

Cardholders who continue to maintain the same FICO score or score range 
will not receive a change in terms. 

If we make changes to your card account after our annual review, you will 
receive advance notice, as required by law, and a right to opt out. If you 
opt out, we will close your card account. You can then pay the remaining 
balance under the existing rate. Of course, this paragraph does not apply to 
changes required by law or our regulators.

REVOCATION:

You agree that your CCCU Visa� Platinum credit card is; the property of 
CCCU, not transferable, and must be surrendered upon demand. We can 
repossess the card, and revoke all privileges at any time and without notice 
including, but not limited to, the following conditions:

� A negative impact to your creditworthiness.

� Your CCCU loan account/s is delinquent.

� Your failure to maintain the minimum required balance on your 
Credit Union Share Account.

� Your failure to satisfy or adhere to the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement.

� You make false or misleading statements in any credit application or 
update of credit information.

� If something happens which the Credit Union believes may reduce 
your ability to repay what you owe.

LATE FEE:

A late fee of $32 will be charged when a payment is not received within 
two days after the Payment Due Date or the payment was less than the 
Minimum Payment amount due. The fee will be reflected on your monthly 
periodic statement.

CREDIT CARD OVERLIMIT ALLOWANCE FEE:

A fee of $19 will be charged, if you have opted to permit authorizations 
to take your balance up to 110% of your credit limit and authorizations 
have caused your account balance to exceed $20 over your credit limit. 
The Credit Card Overlimit Allowance Fee will be charged with each new 
extension of credit that is over your credit limit.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS:

Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be 
debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between 
the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing 
international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of 
rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central 
processing date, which may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the 
government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing 
date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the 
rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement 
posting date.

FOREIGN TRANSACTION FEE:

A fee of 3% of the amount of the transaction, calculated in U.S. dollars, will 
be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances, 
and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that 
you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the U.S., 
Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands. The fee amount will appear on your 
statement directly below the transaction details.

The Credit Union may terminate this Agreement or cancel your Card at any time. Such termination, or cancellation, however, will not effect your obligation to pay the account balance. 

29. Lost or Stolen Cards: You must notify us immediately if a Card is lost or stolen or if you believe there has been or is about to be unauthorized use of Card by calling: (800) 449-7728

This fee will be assessed on all international purchases, credit vouchers, and cash disbursements. The exchange rate for transactions in a foreign currency will be a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or the government mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date, plus the 1% International Transaction Fee.

Municipal Credit Union 
FIXED RATE VISA CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT RETAIL INSTALLMENT CREDIT AGREEMENT 
1 De?nitions: In this Agreement the words �we�, �us� and �our� mean Municipal Credit Union, 22 Cortlandt Street, New York, New York 10007. The words �you�, �your� and �cardholder� mean anyone in whose name a VISA Card is issued. Annual Percentage Rate: The cost of your credit as a yearly rate. Finance Charge: The dollar amount the credit will cost you. 
2 Purchases: Your Card can be used to buy or lease goods or buy services any place that honors VISA. The debt that results from a Purchase will be transferred to us. 
3 Advances: Your Card can be used to obtain an advance (loan) at any of our branch of?ces, at any ?nancial institution which honors VISA or any other authorized location. If you have received a personal identi?cation number (PIN), you may use your Card and PIN to obtain advances at any ATM that accepts your Card. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, such advances shall be treated as Cash Advances under this Agreement. 
4 Convenience Checks: Upon request, and from time to time, we may send you convenience checks for use in borrowing under this Agreement. All convenience checks you use will be treated as cash advances under this Agreement unless we advise you otherwise. You may not use the convenience checks to make payments on any MCU credit card account. You understand that if you use a convenience check to make a purchase and you have a dispute with that purchase, the dispute is not covered by the Billing Rights Summary below. You understand that the convenience checks will not be returned to you. 
5 Purchases Treated as Cash Advances: 	We consider certain transactions to be the equivalent of cash advances, and we reserve the right to treat them as cash advances under this Agreement. Those transactions include using the Card or Account to purchase wire transfer money orders, money orders that are not issued by a ?nancial institution or are not in U.S. currency, travelers checks, casino gaming chips, lottery tickets, off-track betting, wagers at racetracks, and tax payments. 
6 Maximum Credit Limit: We will from time to time notify you of the maximum amount of credit which we will extend you 

under this Agreement. A portion of your credit limit, called the cash advance limit, will be available for cash advances. We may increase or decrease the credit limit or cash advance limit at anytime. The cash advance limit will be shown on your monthly statement. We will not be responsible for failing to extend credit to you under this Agreement. You agree not to allow the balance on your account to go over the maximum credit limit. We will not extend credit if: 
� The extension of credit would cause the balance of your account to exceed your credit limit or if the balance of your account already exceeds your credit limit, or 
� Anything has happened that allows us to declare your account in default and therefore immediately due, or 
� Your Card has been canceled or suspended, or 
� Your Card has expired. If we do extend credit under any of the conditions above, it will be covered by the terms and provisions of this Agreement. We may delay extending credit if you have previously sent us a payment check or other negotiable instrument which has been returned as unpaid for any reason. 

7. 	Monthly Billing Statement: If you have a balance in your account, we will send you a monthly billing statement. It will show the total amount of your Purchases and Cash Advance Accounts, the ?nance charge, the minimum payment due, and the date the payment is due. 
8a. Finance Charge on Purchases: A ?nance charge will be imposed on each Purchase from the date the Purchase is posted to your account until the date it is paid in full, with the following exceptions: You may avoid ?nance charges on purchases during any billing period if: (1) the opening balance on Purchases during any billing period was zero (0); or (2) the total of payments and credits posted during the billing period equals or exceeds the opening balance for that billing period. 
We calculate the Finance Charge on Purchases by applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your Purchase Account (including current transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your Purchases Account each day, add any new Purchases and subtract any payments or credits applied to Purchases that day, unpaid ?nance charges, late charges, overlimit fees and returned item fees. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the �average daily balance� which is shown on your statement as the Finance Charge Balance for Purchases. Finally, we multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate of .04082% (corresponding Annual Percentage Rate of 14.90%) and the number of days in the billing period. 
8b. Finance Charge on Cash Advances: A ?nance charge will be imposed on each Cash Advance from the day the Cash Advance is obtained until the date it is paid in full. We calculate the Finance Charge on Cash Advances by adding any Transaction Fee applied to new Cash Advances to the amount determined by applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your Cash Advance Account (including current transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your Cash Advance Account each day, add any new Cash Advances, and subtract any payments or credits applied to Cash Advances that day, unpaid ?nance charges, late charges, overlimit fees, transaction fees, and returned item fees. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the �average daily balance� which is shown on your statement as the Finance Charge Balance for Cash Advances. Finally, we multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate of .04904%(corresponding Annual Percentage Rate of 17.90%) and the number of days in the billing period. 
8c. Minimum Finance Charge: There will be a minimum ?nance charge of ?fty cents ($.50) for each billing period in which a ?nance charge is payable on your Purchases Account. 
8d. Cash Advance Transaction Fee: You will pay a transaction fee (?nance charge) each time you obtain a Cash Advance. The transaction fee will be 3% of the amount advanced but not less than $1.00 or more than $30.00. 

9. 	Returned Item Fee: We will charge you a returned item fee of $20.00 whenever your payment is returned to us for insuf?cient funds or any other reason. 

10. Late Charges: You pay a late charge of $25.00 any time a minimum payment remains unpaid for more than one billing period. 

11. Overlimit Fee: You will pay an overlimit fee of $20.00 if the principal balance of Purchases and Cash Advances exceeds your established credit limit on the closing date of your billing period. 

12. Payment: You promise to pay us all the amounts borrowed under this Agreement and any other amounts which you may owe us pursuant to this Agreement. 

At any time and without penalty, you may repay all or part of what you owe. You must, however, make at least the minimum payment each month. This minimum payment will be the total of: (1) the greater of [a] 1/60th of the outstanding principal Cash Advances and Purchases, or [b] $5.00, or the balance due, whatever is less; plus (2) currently calculated ?nance charges, cash advance transaction fees, other fees and charges incurred 
during the billing period, and insurance premium charges; plus 
(3) any minimum payment amount which is past due; plus (4) 
any amount in excess of your credit limit. Paying more than the minimum payment for your account for any billing period will not relieve you of the obligation to pay any further minimum payment for your account. 

13. Payment Allocation: Your payment will be applied in the following order to any of these costs you owe: (1) collection costs, (2) fees and other card charges, (3) late charges, ?nance charges and insurance premiums in manner and order Credit Union elects, (4) unpaid principal balance of accrued Purchases and Cash Advances. 

14. Insurance: Credit life insurance and/or credit disability insurance may be made available to you by the Credit Union. Insurance coverage is not required by us as a condition for the extension of credit. If you should elect and qualify for the same, the coverage will be up to the minimum amount of credit extended to you. If you die, the insurance proceeds will be used to pay off your outstanding debt on the account. If you wish to have this coverage, you will give us a dated and signed written statement that you desire to obtain insurance coverage before we make it available. A certi?cate describing the coverage will be mailed to you 30 days after coverage begins. The premiums for this insurance will be due monthly and will be added to your minimum payment each billing period. 

15. Default: You will be in default if you fail to make a minimum payment when due. You will be in default if you break any promise you made under this Agreement, or under any other written agreement made in connection with use of the card. You will also be in default if you become insolvent, declare bankruptcy or die. When you are in default, the Credit Union may demand immediate payment of the entire amount you owe under this Agreement without giving you advance notice. 

Also, we may prohibit any further transactions on your Account, cancel the Cards, and revoke any privileges attaching to the Cards. You agree to surrender all Cards to us or our designee upon demand. If you default, we, at our option, may refuse to pay any of your convenience checks that are presented to us. If we decide to honor such checks, you will owe us the amount of such checks under the terms of this Agreement. 

16. No Notice or Loss of Rights: 	We do not have to notify you if any amount owing under this Agreement is not paid by the day it becomes due. We can do any of the following without notifying you or losing any right against you: 
� accept a check or money order marked �paid in full� or with similar language, as a payment under this Agreement, or 
� give additional time for payment of any amount owing under 

thisAgreement, regardless of the length of any additional time we previously gave, or 
c. 	exercise, give up, fail to exercise or delay exercising any right against any person. 

17. Collection Costs: If you are in default, you agree to pay actual costs of collection. This may include reasonable attorney fees not to exceed 20% of the amount due. 

18. Amendment: We can change the terms of this Agreement, including the ?nance charge, and the annual percentage rate, at any time. Except where limited by applicable law, the new terms will apply both to new purchases and cash advances and to the full outstanding balance of your account as of the day of the change. In accordance with applicable law, we will notify you of any increased charge or change by writing to you at the most recent address shown for you on our records. 

19. Statement, Notices and Change of Address: Any statement for your account or any notice concerning your account or this Agreement we send you will be sent to your current mailing address as shown in our records concerning your account. We can send it by regular mail. If your mailing address changes, you must promptly notify us in writing of the new address. Any notice you send us must be sent to: PSCU-MCU, P.O. Box 31112, Tampa, Florida 33631-3112.

Each VISA Card issued for use with your account is and will remain our property and must be returned to us if requested to do so. We or anyone acting for us can keep the VISA Card if it is used after your account has been canceled or after we have requested you to return it to us.

23.AdditionalCardholders,Authorized Users,andOthers Using Your Account: You may authorize others to use your Account. At your request, we may issue one additional Card to you.

We may, in our discretion, approve transactions that cause your balance to exceed your credit limit without waiving any of our rights under this Agreement. 

6.	
Finance Charges: The total Finance Charge imposed on your Account each Billing Cycle is the sum of the Interest Charges plus all Transaction Fees imposed during that Billing Cycle. 

(a) 
Interest Charges 

� 
Interest Charges on Goods and Services Purchased by Card: We will impose no Interest Charge to your Account if we credit you for payment of the entire New Balance shown on your Statement by the Payment Due Date. If your payment is not credited to your Account by the Payment Due Date (see Section 11), or you do not pay your New Balance in full, we will impose an Interest Charge on the average daily balance outstanding on your Account for the number of days in your Billing Cycle. 

� 
Interest Charges on Cash Advances and Balance Transfers: We will impose an Interest Charge for your cash advances (whether they are obtained by Check or Card), including any balances you transfer, from the date of the cash advance or the date the balance transfer posts. 

� 
Calculation of Average Daily Balance(s): We use the average daily balance method (including current transactions) for calculating your average daily balance(s). We will determine an average daily balance for (1) each of your purchase balances, and (2) each of your cash advance (including balance transfers) balances. To get the daily balance for your purchase and cash advance (including balance transfer) amounts, we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchase, cash advance and balance transfer amounts, as applicable, add any new charges and fees, subtract any applicable portions of payments and credits, and add applicable unpaid Interest Charges from the application of the daily periodic rate to each day�s ending balance. 

� 
Calculation of Your Interest Charge: Your Interest Charge for the period is based on the applicable Annual Percentage Rate (APR) associated with each balance. We disclose the currently effective APR in our Pricing Information Disclosure, which is part of this Agreement and is included with our letter to you advising you that your Account has been approved. Portions of your Balance, however, may be subject to prior APRs. We calculate Interest Charges separately for your purchase and cash advance (including balance transfer) balances under each applicable APR. We list each balance and the applicable interest rate in the Interest Charge Calculation section of your Statement. We compute each Interest Charge by: 

(1) 
calculating the daily periodic rate, 

(2) 
multiplying the average daily balance for each balance by the applicable daily periodic rate (which is based on the APR applied to that balance), 

(3) 
multiplying each of the products in (2) by the number of days in the Billing Cycle, and 

(4) 
adding together all the products obtained in (3) to obtain your Total Interest for the period. 





(b) 
Transaction Fees: You will pay additional Finance Charges, called �Transaction Fees,� if incurred. A description of these fees is included below; however, the actual fee for these transactions is listed in our Pricing Information Disclosure at the end of this Agreement. In the first Billing Cycle in which a Transaction Fee is posted, the Transaction Fee may cause the APR shown on your Statement for that Billing Cycle to exceed the nominal APR. 




� Foreign Transaction (Foreign Currency Conversion) Fee. MasterCard International, Inc. or Visa International, as applicable, will convert any charges you incur in currency other than U.S. dollars into a U.S. dollar amount under the currency conversion procedures set forth in their respective Operating Regulations in effect at the time the transaction is processed. The non-U.S. 
dollar transaction amount is converted into a U.S. dollar amount by multiplying the transaction amount in the non-U.S. dollar currency by a currency conversion or exchange rate. The currency conversion rate is either (1) a government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable processing date; or, 
(2) for MasterCard, a wholesale rate provided to MasterCard for the applicable processing date; or, (3) for Visa, a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives. The currency conversion rate is determined as of the date the transaction is processed and may differ from the rate in effect on the date the transaction occurred or posted to your account. Both MasterCard and Visa charge us, as the processing bank, a percentage of the transaction amount. The fee we charge you for foreign currency conversions is contained in our Pricing Information Disclosure at the end of this Agreement. 
� 
Cash Advance Fee. We charge you a fee for cash advances you make. For purposes of the imposition of Cash Advance Fees, the term �cash advance� means a cash advance loan made to you or on your behalf through the use of a Card, but does not include purchases, the use of Checks, or balance transfers to your Account from credit card accounts you maintained at other financial institutions. See your Pricing Information Disclosure at the end of this Agreement for the amount of the fee. 

� 
Balance Transfer Fee. We do not charge a Balance Transfer Fee. 


(c) 
Compounding of Finance Charges and Unpaid Finance Charges: Finance Charges compound daily. We will consolidate unpaid Finance Charges and other unpaid charges into your Account balance daily. In this way, unpaid Finance Charges and other unpaid charges from the previous day will be subject to and included in the calculation of the new Finance Charge. 

(d) 
Penalty Pricing: We will not increase your APR if your Account becomes delinquent; however, if your Account was already in Penalty Pricing prior to August 21, 2009, it will remain so until the Account is in non-delinquent status for three consecutive Billing Cycles, at which time the Penalty Pricing will be removed and the Account will revert to standard pricing. 



7.	
Rates: Your APR and Daily Periodic Rate are based on the highest prime rate as published in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of the month (the �Prime Rate�). Your APR and Daily Periodic Rate are subject to increase (or decrease) monthly if the Prime Rate increases or decreases. Your APR will be equal to the Prime Rate as published on the last business day of the preceding calendar month, plus a 6.9% margin. The APR will never increase above the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. An increase in the Prime Rate, which causes the APR to increase, will result in an increase in the amount of the Finance Charge. This may cause an increase in the Minimum Payment Due or cause a smaller amount of your payment of the Minimum Payment Due to be applied to principal. 

8.	
Fees: Annual Fees, if any, Transaction Fees (e.g., Balance Transfer Fees, Cash Advance Fees, Foreign Currency Conversion Fees), and Penalty Fees (e.g., any Late Payment Fee, Overlimit Fee, or Returned Payment Fee) are disclosed in our Pricing Information Disclosure at the end of this Agreement. You also agree to pay the following one-time fees if incurred: 

(a) 
Expedited Card Fee (for requests of expedited delivery of Cards): $25 

(b) 
Document Fee (for duplicate copies of Statements and copies of charge slips or other documents not requested in connection with a billing error): $5 per Statement or item 

(c) 
Expedited Delivery of Payment Fees (for rush payments): 

� 
Automated Clearing House (�ACH�) payment transfers that you initiate through a Bank customer service representative whom you contact by using the 800 telephone number listed on your Statement: $5 

� 
Payment transfers you make from one of your Bank checking or savings accounts with the assistance of a Bank Customer Contact Center representative: $2 





9.	
Changes to Rates, Fees and Terms: We may add, delete or change any term of this Agreement at any time unless the law prohibits us from doing so. We can increase your Interest Charge for new transactions and your Fees one year after your Account has been opened. We will send notice of any changes to you at the address you have given us as required by law. 

(a) 
If we increase your fees, we will inform you of your options in advance, including any right you may have to opt out of some of these changes. If you do opt out, we will close your line of credit to new purchases and cash advances, and we will not permit you to transfer balances to your Account from another credit card account. However, if you have failed to make the required Minimum Payment Due within 60 days after the Payment Due Date for that payment, you agree that any new or changed fee(s) shall apply both to existing balances and new transactions. 

(b) 
Your variable APR can go up or down monthly as the index for the rate goes up or down. If we increase your Interest Charge for any other reason, we will notify you in writing; however, we will not apply any such increase to the existing balance in your Account. 




(c) 
If the Bank has temporarily reduced your APR in connection with a hardship arrangement, we will notify you in writing when the arrangement ends and the temporary APR reverts to your prior APR. The prior APR will then apply to your outstanding balance as well as to any new transactions. 

(d) 
If you are a service member on special APR, we will notify you in writing, in accordance with federal regulations, when your APR reverts to your prior APR. The prior APR will apply to your outstanding balance as well as to any new transactions. 



10. 
Billing Statement and Notification of Billing Error: We will send you a periodic Billing Statement every month. It is your responsibility to review the Statement and notify us promptly of any charge or item you believe to be in error or subject to dispute. If you do not notify us of any disputed items within sixty (60) days after the date we send you the Statement on which the error first appears, the item(s) will be conclusively deemed as correct to the extent permitted by law. You will not receive any cancelled Checks with your Statements; however, you may obtain a photocopy of an electronic image of any Check we have in our records that you request. You may be required to pay a Document Fee for such copies. (See Section 8 for fee.). 

11. 
Payments and Late Payment Fee: You can pay off your Account balance in full each month or you can pay in monthly installments. 

(a) 
Crediting Your Payment: Payments must be made to us in U.S. dollars from a U.S. deposit account and otherwise be acceptable to us. We do not accept cash payments through the mail. We will credit your payment to your Account on the date we �receive it� as follows: 

� 
If you make your payment in person at one of our branches on a Bank business day (any day except Saturday, Sunday or a bank holiday), we will credit your payment on that day if we receive your payment prior to branch closing and you provide your payment coupon with your payment. Otherwise, crediting of your payment will be delayed. 

� 
If you make your payment by mail, we must receive it at the specific address we publish on your Billing Statement. Your payment coupon must be included with the payment. Otherwise, our receipt and crediting of your payment will be delayed. 

� 
If you make your payment at one of our ATMs on a Bank business day, we will credit your payment on that day if you make the payment prior to the ATM cutoff time for that ATM and you include your payment coupon. 

� 
If you make your payment via an electronic transfer (ACH transfer, bill pay, transfer from another account, etc.), we will credit your payment on the day that it posts to your Account. 

� 
If our crediting of your payment is delayed because your payment is mailed to the wrong address, does not meet our branch or ATM cutoff time, or does not include your payment coupon (when applicable), we will generally credit your payment to your Account the next Bank business day, but no later than 5 days after we receive it. 



(b) 
Minimum Payment Due: Your Minimum Payment Due is listed on your Statement and equals the lesser of: 

� 
the amount of your New Balance, or 

� 
the greater of: 

� 
$30, or 

� 
3% of the amount you owe, or 

�	
the sum of Finance Charges accrued since the last Billing Cycle (including Interest Charges and Transaction Fees), plus any Penalty Fees, Annual Fees (if applicable), and one-time fees that have been posted to your Account, plus 1% of the amount you owe. 








Making only the Minimum Payment Due will increase the amount of interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance. 
(c) 
Late Payment Fee: If payment of the Minimum Payment Due amount on your Account is not credited to your Account by Payment Due Date, we will charge you a Late Payment Fee unless your Minimum Payment Due is less than $30, in which case we will not assess a late Payment Fee. (See our Pricing Information Disclosure at the end of this Agreement for a description of the fee.) 

(d) 
Prepaid Status: If you pay more than the Minimum Payment Due during any particular Billing Cycle, you still must pay the Minimum Payment Due in subsequent Billing Cycles unless we notify you that you are in �prepaid status.� Your Account can achieve �prepaid status� if you pay at least twice the amount of the Minimum Payment Due but less than the New Balance, whichever is less. Your Account can be in prepaid status without a payment being required for a maximum of three consecutive months. If your Account is in prepaid status and you continue to make payments, the prepaid status will remain in effect until the prepaid amountisequal toorlessthantheMinimumPayment Due. YourAccount cannot be in prepaid status if your Account is in an adverse condition (delinquent, overlimit, etc.) or if the entire Balance is due. If you pay the New Balance in full or make a payment that is greater than the balance, your Account cannot be in a prepaid status and any existing prepaid status that may exist is cancelled. 

(e) 
Application of Payments: We apply your Minimum Payment Due amount to your lower APR balances before higher ones. We apply any portion of your payment in excess of your Minimum Payment Due to higher APR balances before lower ones. 


(f) Skip Payments: We may allow you to skip a payment during certain Billing Cycles (a �payment holiday�). If you accept a payment holiday, we will continue to apply Interest Charges but will not impose a Late Payment Fee. All credit terms and provisions contained in this Agreement (including Minimum Payment Due and any applicable Late Payment Fee) will apply for the Billing Cycle following a payment holiday. 

12. Credit Obtained by Checks: To obtain credit by using Convenience Checks, you must use the Checks we provide to you that are imprinted with your name and Account number. You are liable and responsible for all Checks written against your Account if they are signed by anyone whom you authorized to do so. We are not liable or responsible for paying postdated Checks. We are also not liable or responsible if, due to our paying a postdated Check or other Check you have asked us not to pay, other Checks are dishonored or returned unpaid. We are not liable or responsible for dishonoring and returning a Check unpaid if 
(1) 
payment of the Check would cause you to exceed your available line of credit, 

(2) 
because you are then in default under, or in breach of the terms of this Agreement, or (3) because your privileges under this Agreement have been revoked. If, however, we pay any Check in our discretion that we could have properly dishonored or returned unpaid for any reason (including the above reasons), then you, nevertheless, agree to pay the amount of the Check. Payment of a Check shall not constitute our waiver of amounts due and unpaid at that time. 



13. 
Ownership of Checks and Cards: Cards are issued by, and are the property of, First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company. Cards and related Convenience Checks remain our property at all times and may be repossessed by us at any time. We may refuse to issue or reissue you a Card or Checks, revoke your Card or limit Card use, and/or revoke your privileges relating to the use of Checks, without your knowledge and without notice to you. If we revoke your Card or withdraw your privilege to use any Checks, and you become aware of such revocation/withdrawal, you must surrender to us or our agent the Card, the Checks, and any other cards or devices that may be used to access the Account. You must not use any expired, revoked or otherwise invalid Card or Checks to obtain, or attempt to obtain, credit. You must not use the Card, Checks and/or the Account for any illegal transactions. 

14. 
Responsibility for Charges to Your Account: We may charge your Account for any transaction authorized either by you or by any Authorized User. Valid authorization for a transaction may be given (1) in writing (e.g., by signing a sales slip or cash advance slip), (2) verbally (e.g., by telephone), or (3) electronically (e.g., over the Internet). If you or any Authorized User gives your Account number to any third party who uses that information to initiate a charge against your Account, we will consider the transaction authorized by you. 

15. 
Refusal to Honor Card or Checks; Adjustments: We are not responsible if a Merchant refuses to honor your Card or Checks. If your Account requires an adjustment for goods or services purchased (a return), we will make the adjustment only to your Account and only upon our receipt of a properly executed credit slip. You agree not to accept any cash refunds with respect to any adjustments for goods or services purchased. 

16.

(a) Each of the following constitutes an event of default:

The occurrence of an event that gives us reason to believe that your ability to pay us on time has been impaired, or that you may use your Card or Checks improperly. 


(b) Our rights in the event of default: We may, at our option and after giving you all legally required notices and rights to cure, declare all amounts you owe us immediately due and payable with interest at the rate provided in this Agreement. If this occurs, you agree to pay us, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all costs of collection, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys� fees and expenses. Any such attorneys� fees will be added to the unpaid Balance on your Account and interest will be charged on this amount at the rate provided in this Agreement. We also have the right to cancel the Agreement and take immediate possession of all Cards and Checks. 


17. 
Investigating Your Credit; Reporting Your Credit History: You authorize us, at any time we feel appropriate, to obtain or conduct whatever credit investigation we feel is needed to evaluate your credit, personal or financial standing, and/or employment. Upon our request, you agree to provide us with your current financial information. You also authorize us to report information about your Account to consumer (credit) reporting agencies, and share your credit experience, including information on late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your Account, with consumer reporting agencies, creditors and any others. This information may be reflected in your credit report. 


18. 
Contacting You: You expressly authorize us, our affiliates, our agents, and any independent contractors we hire to contact you in person or by using an automated device or prerecorded messaging system or any other way at any telephone number or other electronic device or devices we or our affiliates or agents believe will or may connect us/them with you including, but not limited to (1) cell phone numbers you have given to us or w",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

This Agreement covers your VISA Platinum Credit Card, Platinum Plus Credit Card, Business Platinum Credit Card and/or VISA Debit Card with Cyprus Federal Credit Union. In this Agreement the words you and your mean each and all of those who use or sign a card. We, us and ours mean Cyprus Credit Union. Card and/or Credit card means the VISA Platinum Card, VISA Platinum Plus Card, Business Platinum Card and/or VISA Debit Card and any duplicates and renewals we issue. Account means your VISA Platinum Card Line of Credit account, VISA Platinum Plus Line of Credit account, VISA Business Platinum Line of Credit account and/or VISA Debit Overdraft Line of Credit account with us. You agree that if you receive, sign, request, use or permit others to use or sign any of the cards issued under this Agreement, that you have accepted and agreed to all of the following terms, as amended from time to time.
You agree to all procedures required by us or any merchant which honors your card as well as all terms on the card. Any plural term used in this Agreement shall be deemed singular if context and construction so require. Any singular term used in this Agreement shall be deemed plural if context and construction so require.

1. Responsibility. If we issue you a card, you agree to repay all amounts due and the FINANCE CHARGE arising from the use of the card and the card account.  You are responsible for charges made by yourself, your spouse and minor children.  You are also responsible for charges made by anyone else to whom you give the card, and this responsibility continues until the card is recovered. You cannot disclaim responsibility by notifying us, but we will close the account for new transactions if you so request and return all cards.  Your obligation to pay the account balance continues even though an agreement, divorce decree, or other court judgment may direct you or one of the other persons responsible to pay the account.  Any person using the card is jointly responsible with you for charges he or she makes and any fees, but if that person signs the card, he or she becomes a party to this Agreement and is also jointly responsible for all charges on the account, including yours.

2. Lost Card Notification.  If you believe the Card has been lost or stolen, IMMEDIATELY CALL THE CREDIT UNION at: 801-260-7600, 1-800-929-7787 during regular business hours or 1-800-682-6075 after hours. If your PIN has been compromised, call #1-800-754-4128. A fee may be assessed for replacement of each lost card.  Refer to the fee schedule.

3. Your Liability for Unauthorized Use.  If you believe your Card or your PIN has been lost or stolen or that someone has transferred or may transfer money from your account(s) without your permission, tell us AT ONCE.  Telephoning is the best way of keeping your potential losses down.

4. Credit Line.  We have established a self-replenishing VISA Credit Card Line of Credit or VISA Debit Card Line of Credit for you and have notified you of its amount when we issued the card or on your statement. You agree not to let the account balance exceed this approved Credit Line. Each payment you make on the account will restore your Credit Line by the amount of the payment which is applied to principal. You may request an increase in your Credit Line by contacting us, and approval by a loan officer. By giving you written notice we may reduce your Credit Line from time to time, or with good cause, revoke your card and Credit Line. Good cause includes your failure to comply with this Agreement, or our adverse reevaluation of your creditworthiness. You may also terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by either of us does not affect your obligation to pay all the amounts due plus FINANCE CHARGES. The card(s) remain our property and you must recover and surrender to us all cards upon our request and upon termination of this Agreement, or pay necessary recovery costs incurred by us.

5. Credit Information.  You authorize us to investigate your credit standing when opening, renewing, or reviewing your account. You authorize us to disclose information regarding your account to credit reporting agencies and creditors who inquire of us about your credit standing.

6. Monthly Payment.  We will mail you a statement every month showing your Previous Balance of purchases and cash advances for Credit Card and withdrawals for VISA Debit card, the current transactions on your account, the remaining credit available under your Credit Line, the New Balances of purchases and VISA Credit Card cash advances and VISA Debit withdrawals, the Total New Balance, the FINANCE CHARGE, any other billed fees, and the Minimum Payment required. Your statement will show the required payment you must make for that statement and the date it is due.  By separate agreement you may authorize us to charge the minimum payment automatically to your Share Savings or Checking Account with us.  You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment or pay the Total New Balance in full, and you will reduce the FINANCE CHARGE by so doing.

a. VISA Credit Card Monthly Payment. Every month you must pay at least the Minimum Payment upon receipt of your statement. The Minimum Payment will be either (a) 3% of your Total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater; or (b) your Total New Balance, if it is less than $25.00, plus any portion of the Minimum Payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid.  In addition, if at any time your total New Balance exceeds your Credit Line, you must immediately pay the excess amount.  We will apply your payments first to the FINANCE CHARGE on both purchases and cash advances, then to any billed fees, then to the principal balance of purchases and cash advances.
b.  VISA Debit Card Monthly Payment.  The Minimum Payment will be either (a) 3% of your Total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater; or (b) your Total New Balance, if it is less than $25.00, plus any portion of the Minimum Payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid. In addition, at any time your total New Balance exceeds your Line of Credit, you must immediately pay the excess amount. We will apply your payments first to the FINANCE CHARGE on both purchases and withdrawals, then to any billed fees, then to the principal balance of purchases and withdrawals.


7. Finance Charges.
a. VISA Credit Card.  You can avoid FINANCE CHARGES on purchases by paying the statement balance in full each month within 25 days of the statement closing date.  If you pay part of the purchases included in the statement balance within 25 days of the statement closing date, FINANCE CHARGES will not apply to the amount paid. However, cash advance fees may still apply.  If the payment due date falls on a non-business day, payment must be received by the last business day prior to the due date.
     You may be subject to a fixed rate or variable rate of interest.  The applicable rate will be disclosed to you on your Disclosure Statement and monthly statements.  Interest is calculated by multiplying the applicable daily interest rate times the average daily balance of purchases and cash advances.  The daily interest rate is calculated by dividing the applicable rate by 365.  The principal balances of purchases and cash advances are determined each date during the statement period beginning with the principal portion of your Previous Balances, reduced by payments you make and credits we apply, and increased by purchases and cash advances you make and debit adjustments we make during the statement period.  The daily principal balances are totaled and divided by the number of days in the statement period.  This produces separate average daily principal balances for purchases and cash advances to which the daily periodic rate is applied.  The variable rate is the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate published on the last day of the month plus a margin.  The margin for the VISA Platinum and VISA Platinum Plus is based on your credit risk and will be disclosed to you on your Disclosure Statement.  The maximum variable ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is the highest legal rate.  The maximum increase or decrease your rate can change per calendar year is 3.0%.
b Business Visa Platinum Card. You can avoid FINANCE CHARGES on purchases and cash advances by paying the statement balance in full each month within 25 days of the statement closing date. If the payment due date falls on a non-business day, payment must be received by the last business day prior to the due date. Otherwise, FINANCE CHARGES will be accessed beginning from the previous month�s transaction posting date, through the current month�s statement closing date.  
	A cash advance fee of 1�% of the cash advance will be charged to your account for each cash advance.  This cash advance fee also applies to withdrawals made from your VISA account through automatic teller machines and other means.
	Your variable rate interest is calculated by multiplying the applicable variable daily rate times the average daily balance of purchases and cash advances.  The variable rate is Wall Street Journal Prime Rate published on the last day of the month plus a margin.  The margin for the Business Visa Platinum Card is as low as 6%.  The daily rate is calculated by dividing the applicable variable rate by 365. The principal balances of purchases and cash advances are determined each day during the statement period, beginning with the principal portion of your Previous Balances, reduced by payments you make and credits we apply, and increased by purchases and cash advances you make and debit adjustments we make during the statement period. The daily principal balances are totaled, and divided by the number of days in the statement period, to produce separate average daily principal balances for purchases and cash advances to which the periodic rate is then applied.
c. VISA Debit card. Your interest is calculated by multiplying the applicable daily rate times the average daily balance of purchases and withdrawals. The fixed rate is as low as 12.90%. The daily rate is calculated by dividing the applicable rate by 365. The principal balances of purchases and withdrawals are determined each day during the statement period, beginning with the principal portion of your Previous Balances, reduced by payments you make and credits we apply, and increased by purchases and withdrawals you make and debit adjustments we make during the statement period

8. Default.  You will be in default if you fail to make any Minimum Payment within 10 days after your statement due date.  You will also be in default if your ability to repay us is materially reduced, you are a debtor in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, you pass away, you fail to abide by this Agreement or if the value of our security interest materially declines.  We have the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance if you default.  To the extent permitted by law, you will also be required to pay our collection expenses, including court costs and reasonable attorneys� fees.

9. Using the Card.  To make a purchase or cash advance, there are several methods for use of the card.  You may present the card to a participating VISA plan merchant, to us, or to another financial institution. You may complete the transaction by using your Personal Identification Number (PIN) in conjunction with the card in an Automated Teller Machine or other type of electronic terminal that provides access to the VISA system. You may provide your VISA card information to merchants either by phone or by mail. The monthly statement will identify the merchant, electronic terminal, or financial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advance, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. The Credit Union may make a reasonable charge for photo copies of documents you request.

10. Returns and Adjustments.
	a. VISA Platinum Credit Card, VISA Platinum Plus Credit Card, Business Platinum Credit Card.  Merchants and others who honor the Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending us a credit slip which we will post to your account.  If your credits and payments exceed what you owe us, we will hold and apply this credit balance against future purchases and cash advances, or if it is $1.00 or more, refund it upon your written request.
	b. VISA Debit card.  Merchants and others who honor the Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending us a credit slip which we will post to your Checking Account.

11. Foreign Transactions.  Purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. Dollars.  The conversion rate will be made in accordance with the operating regulations for international transactions established by VISA International, Inc.  VISA has the right to assess a Foreign Conversion Fee.  This fee could be up to 1.5% of the transaction amount 

12. Plan Merchant Disputes.  We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor your card.  We are subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods and services you purchase with the card only if you have made a good faith attempt, but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant, and: (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement we sent or participated in sending you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made from a plan merchant in your state or within 100 miles of your home.  Any other disputes you must resolve directly with the plan merchant.
13. Cross Collateral Agreement.  You hereby pledge as security for the Line of Credit, any collateral that you have pledged as security on any other existing loan or advance at the credit union or which you will pledge as security in the future.  Understand that this is referred to as a cross collateral agreement, and that you knowingly and voluntarily grant the credit union the foregoing described security interests.

14. Lien and Right to Setoff.  You hereby grant us a lien and right to setoff on all shares and accumulated dividends in any individual, joint, multiple party, or transaction accounts.  The Credit Union shall have a statutory lien and right of setoff in all shares and accumulated dividends in all individual, joint, multiple party, or transaction accounts in which any of you has any interest. We may exercise our lien rights without notice.  The lien hereby created shall be a lien on the future amount in any accounts and is a possessor lien.  

15. Effect of Agreement.  This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advance, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.  We may amend this Agreement from time to time by sending you the advance written notice as required by law.  To the extent the law permits, and we indicate in our notice, amendments will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions.

16. Annual Fee.  No annual fees are charged for VISA Credit or Debit cards.

18. Late Charge.  A late charge of $20.00 shall be charged on any payment or partial payment not made within 10 days after its due date.

19. Final Expression.  This agreement is the final expression of the terms of this Card and Account between Cyprus Credit Union and the member(s)/borrower(s)/ user(s); this written Agreement may not be contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.

Write to us as soon as possible, We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called �daily balance�. 

During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the daily rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 

To calculate the daily interest charge, we do the following steps each day for each balance type: 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. 

To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 

We apply fees among various balance types as follows: 

(a) late payment fees are treated as new purchases; 
(b) debt cancellation fees are added proportionately to each balance; 
(c) cash advance and stop payment fees are added to the cash advance balance; 
(d) balance transfer fees are added to the balance transfer balance; and 
(e) foreign transaction fees are added to the purchase balance. 

� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 

� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 

Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type.

1. CONTRACT. This Agreement (�Agreement�) is a contract for the extension of credit. It controls your GE Money Co-Branded Platinum MasterCard account.

2. PARTIES. The parties to this Agreement are you and GE Money Bank. GE Money Bank is located at 170 West Election Road, Suite 125, Draper, Utah 84020. GE 
Money Bank sometimes is called �us,� �we� or �our� in this Agreement. 

3. PROMISE TO PAY. You promise to pay us for all credit that we extend on your account, including credit extended when you let another person use your account. You also promise to pay us for all other amounts owed to us under this Agreement. 

4. CHANGING TERMS. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may change, add to or delete any of the terms of this Agreement, including the interest rates, fees and charges. 

5. GOVERNING LAW. Except as provided in the Dispute and Claim Resolution (Including Arbitration) provision, this Agreement and your account are governed by federal law and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of Utah without regard to its conflicts of law principles. This Agreement has been accepted by us in Utah. 

6. CREDIT CARD. We have issued or will send you a GE Money Bank Co-Branded Platinum MasterCard for your use. You are not permitted to allow anyone else to use your credit card, but if you do, you will be responsible for such use. You will destroy all the credit card(s) issued on your account if we ask you to 
do so. 

7. AUTHORIZED USER/JOINT ACCOUNT. If you ask us to send a credit card to another person that you want to let use your account, you will be responsible for all transactions made by that person. That person will be considered an authorized user. If another person is approved on the account, that person will be considered a joint accountholder. Each joint accountholder may use the account and agrees to the terms of this Agreement. No matter which joint accountholder 
uses the account, each of you must pay back the full amount owed on the account. We may treat each of you as one accountholder. For example, giving notice to one of you is considered the same as giving notice to both of you. Also, we may follow the instructions that we get from one of you even if they differ from instructions given by the other accountholder. 

8. USING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may use your account only as stated in this Agreement. You may use your account for the following: 

� Purchases � You may buy goods or services only for personal, family or household purposes from any merchant that accepts MasterCard; 

� Cash Advances � You may get cash advances as explained in section 9 below; and 

� Balance Transfers � From time to time, we may offer you the chance to transfer balances from your other credit card accounts to this account. Unless we tell you otherwise, we will treat balance transfers as purchases. We reserve the right to decline to process any balance transfer request for any reason, 
and will not transfer a balance from any of our affiliates. Transfers will be processed in the order determined by us. If the amount you wish to transfer is 
greater than your available credit limit, we may reject the request(s). It may take up to four weeks for a balance transfer request to be credited to your 
other credit card account(s). It is your responsibility to make any payments required to keep your other account(s) current and to close your other account(s), if you desire. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur on your other account(s) as a result of your balance transfer(s). If you have a dispute with a creditor, and pay the balance in question by transferring it to your account, you may lose certain dispute rights. 

You may use your account only for lawful personal, family or household purposes. You may not use your account for internet gambling or illegal purposes. You 
may not use your account to pay amounts you owe us on this account or on other accounts you have with us. These restrictions are for our benefit, and we are not responsible to you for enforcing them. 

9. Cash Advances. We may offer you the opportunity to get a cash advance in the following ways: 

� Convenience Checks. We may send you convenience checks. We may not honor a convenience check (i) if you filed for bankruptcy, (ii) if the check is expired, (iii) if your account is closed, (iv) if the amount of the check would exceed your available credit or cash advance limit, or (v) as otherwise stated on your convenience check. 

� Cash and ATM Withdrawals. You can get cash from any institution that accepts the card or account. You can also get cash by making a withdrawal from an automated teller machine (ATM) that accepts the card or account. In addition to the fee we may charge, the ATM owner may charge you a fee for using the ATM. 

� Cash-Like Transactions. If you use your card or account to buy certain cash-like items, we will treat those purchases as cash advances. Cash-like items 
include, for example, money orders, cashier�s checks, traveler�s checks, electronic or wire transfers, foreign currency or other in-bank transactions, tax 
payments, lottery tickets or other legalized gambling transactions, court costs, bail bonds and fines. 

10. CREDIT AND CASH ADVANCE LIMITS. 

A. Assigning Limits. We will assign the following limits on your account. We may increase or decrease either or both of these limits at any time. 

� Credit Limit � This is the highest amount of total credit we will extend to you on your account. 

� Cash Advance Limit � This is the highest amount of credit we will extend to you for cash advances made on your account. Cash transactions will also count towards your credit limit. 

B. Exceeding Limits. We may refuse to authorize you to use your account if that use (including any fees associated with that use) will cause the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit limit. You may not get a cash advance if that cash advance (including interest and cash advance fees) will cause the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit. If we approve a transaction that causes the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit limit or the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit, we do not give up any of our rights under this Agreement and we do not treat it as an increase in your credit limit or cash advance limit. 

C. Limiting Purchases, Balance Transfers or Cash Advances. We reserve the right to not approve transactions on your account. To prevent fraud, we may also limit the number or dollar amount of purchases, balance transfers or cash advances you can make in a particular amount of time. 

11. INTEREST. The section explains (i) the interest rates that will apply to your account, (ii) when interest will be charged on your account, and (iii) how the amount of interest is calculated. 

A. Rates. This following rates apply to purchases, balance transfers and cash advances. The Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account are 
shown in the table above and will also be shown on your billing statement. 

We calculate interest on the balance of your account each day. We use a daily rate to calculate the interest each day. The daily rate is equal to the APR divided by 365. 

1. Purchase Rate. 

For Premier Accounts: The daily rate for purchases is .05477% (APR 19.99%). 
For Choice Accounts: The daily rate for purchases is .06573% (APR 23.99%). 

2. Balance Transfer Rate. 

For Premier Accounts: The daily rate for balance transfers is .05477% (APR 19.99%). 
For Choice Accounts: The daily rate for balance transfers is .06573% (APR 23.99%). 

3. Cash Advance Rate. The daily rate for cash advances is .07395% (APR 26.99%). 

B. When We Charge Interest. We charge interest as described below. 

1. Purchases. We charge interest on your purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full except as set forth below: 

� We will not charge you interest during a billing cycle on any purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the billing cycle or (ii) you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in that billing cycle. 

� We will credit, as of the beginning of the billing cycle, any payment you make by the due date that we allocate to purchases if (i) you had no balance at 
the beginning of the previous billing cycle, or (ii) if you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in the previous billing cycle. 

2. Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. We charge interest on your balance transfers and cash advances (and their related fees) from the date you make the transaction until you pay them in full. You cannot avoid paying interest on balance transfers or cash advances or on their fees. 

C. How We Calculate Interest. During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on 
your account by applying the daily rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 

To calculate the daily interest charge, we do the following steps each day for each balance type: 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. 

To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 

We apply fees among various balance types as follows: 

(a) late payment fees are treated as new purchases; 
(b) debt cancellation fees are added proportionately to each balance; 
(c) cash advance and stop payment fees are added to the cash advance balance; 
(d) balance transfer fees are added to the balance transfer balance; and 
(e) foreign transaction fees are added to the purchase balance. 

� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 

� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 


Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. We charge a minimum of $2.00 of interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest and this charge is added proportionately to each balance type. 

12. FEES. We charge the following fees. The table at the beginning of this Agreement shows the amount of each fee. 

A. Transaction Fees. 

1. A Balance Transfer Fee for each balance transfer you make. 

2. A Cash Advance Fee for each cash advance you get. For ATM cash advances, this fee is in addition to any fee the ATM owner may charge you for using the ATM. 

3. A Foreign Transaction Fee for purchases or cash advances you make in currencies other than U.S. dollars and/or in a country other than the U.S., whether or not the transaction was in a foreign currency. 

B. Penalty Fees. A Late Payment Fee if we do not receive at least the total minimum payment due on your account as shown on your billing statement by 5:00 
p.m. (ET) on the due date. The amount of the late payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if you have paid at least your total minimum payment due by the due date in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if you have failed to pay at least the total minimum payment due by the due date in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the late payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for which the late payment fee is assessed, the amount of the late payment fee will instead be equal to the amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

C. Other Fees. A Stop Payment Fee of $20. We charge this fee if we stop payment on any convenience check at your request. 

13. PAYMENTS. 

A. Required Payment and Crediting of Payment. Each billing cycle you must pay at least the total minimum payment by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the payment due date. You may at any time pay more than the total minimum payment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payment may reduce the amount of interest you will pay. Any payments received after 5:00 p.m. (ET) will be credited as of the next day. We may delay making credit available on your account in the amount of your payment. 

B. Minimum Payment. Your total minimum payment is the sum of the following: 

1. Any past due amounts; and 

2. The greater of either: 

(a) $25; or 

(b) the sum of (i) the interest, (ii) any late payment charged to your account in the current billing cycle and (iii) 1.0% of the new balance shown on your billing statement. 

We round up to the next highest whole dollar in figuring your total minimum payment. If your new balance on your billing statement is less than $25, then your total minimum payment will be equal to the new balance. 

C. How to Make a Payment. To make a payment you must follow all the instructions below and the instructions on your billing statement. If you do not, credit 
of your payment to your account may be delayed up to five days. 

1. Do the following: (a) make your payment in United States dollars by check, money order, or similar instrument from a bank located in the U.S.; (b) send 
the payment coupon from your billing statement with your payment; (c) send the payment and payment coupon in the envelope provided with your billing 
statement to the payment address listed on your billing statement; and (d) send only one payment and one payment coupon in each envelope. Alternatively you 
may make your payment online at the website address shown on your billing statement provided you make your payment in United States dollars from a bank located in the U.S. 

2. Do not do the following: (a) staple, paper clip, tape or fold your payment or payment coupon; (b) include any other papers or items with your payment; (c) use a balance transfer or convenience check from your account to pay us; or (d) send us cash. 

D. Disputed Amounts. If you send us correspondence about a disputed amount, you must send it to the address for billing inquiries shown on your billing statement. You may not send it to the payment address shown on your billing statement. By �disputed amount�, we mean a payment of less than the full balance on your account that is labeled as �payment in full� or similar language, or is given to us as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, or is given to us with other conditions or limitations. We may accept these types of payments without giving up any of our rights. 

E. Authorization. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer 
from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be 
withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. 

F. Payment Allocation. We reserve the right to select the method by which the required minimum payment is allocated to different balances on your account. 
Some or all of the required minimum payment on your account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. The payment allocation method that we use may result in higher interest on your account or reduced savings attributable to any special promotions. Any payment you make in excess of 
the required minimum payment will be allocated to balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs, unless applicable law requires or permits 
otherwise (such as when your account has a certain type of special promotion). 

14. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS. At times, we may offer you special promotions when you use your account for certain transactions. These special promotions will have some terms that are different from the terms in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement apply to any special promotion, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the special promotion. We may terminate your participation in any special promotion if you become more than 60 days late on any payment due on your account. If this happens, each special promotion balance will no longer be subject to the terms of the special promotion and will instead be subject to the terms of this Agreement. Please see any special promotion advertising (including in-store signs) or other disclosures provided to you for the 
full terms of any special promotion offered. 

15. CURRENCY CONVERSION. If you make a transaction with your account in a currency other than U.S. dollars, MasterCard will convert the transaction amount into U.S. dollars using its currency conversion procedure. Under the currency conversion procedure that MasterCard currently uses, the non-U.S. dollar transaction amount is converted into a U.S. dollar amount by multiplying the transaction amount in the non-U.S. dollar currency by a currency conversion rate. The currency conversion rate that MasterCard typically uses is either a government mandated rate, or a wholesale rate provided to MasterCard. The currency conversion rate that MasterCard uses for a particular transaction is the rate MasterCard uses for the applicable currency when the transaction is processed. This rate may differ from the rate in effect when the transaction occurred or when it was posted to your Account, and may be higher than the rate you could have gotten if you had converted U.S. dollars into the foreign currency. 

16. UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should call us immediately at: 
1-866-848-5625. 

You will not be liable for any unauthorized use on your account. 

You agree that unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given your card or allowed use of your account. You will be responsible 
for all use by such a person. 

17. YOUR CREDIT REPORTS AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION. 

A. Using and Sharing Your Information. When you applied for an account you gave us information about yourself. You also agreed that we could ask others for information about your creditworthiness and that we could ask consumer reporting agencies for your consumer report. We use this information in considering your application. We also use this information for any updates, renewals or extensions of credit on your account.

a copy of the credit report that includes the wrong information, send a copy of it with your written communication. 

We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. 

18. USE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOUR ACCOUNT. We will use information about you and your account as set forth in the privacy policy that is attached to or enclosed with this document. 

19. CHANGE OF ADDRESS/PHONE NUMBER. You agree to tell us right away if you change your address or phone number(s). We will contact you at the address in our records until we are able to update our records with your new address.

You also consent to us and any other owner or servicer of your account contacting you about your account, including using text messages, any automatic telephone dialing system and/or an artificial or prerecorded voice when contacting you, even if you are charged for the call under your phone plan. You are responsible for any charges for contacting you that may be billed to you by your communications carriers. 

21. TELEPHONE MONITORING. For quality control purposes, you permit us to listen to or record telephone calls between you and us. 

22. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. 

A. When You May Close Your Account. You may close your account at any time by writing or calling us and asking us to close your account.

B. When We May Close Your Account. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may close your account at any time and for any reason. 

C. After You or We Close Your Account. If you or we close your account, you must stop using it. You will still have to pay us the full amount you owe on 
your account. This Agreement controls your account until you pay it in full. 

23. DEFAULT. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, you are in default if you: 

� Make a late payment; 
� Do not follow any other term of this Agreement; or 
� Become bankrupt or insolvent. 

If you default or upon your death, we may, subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law: (i) make the full amount owing on your account due 
right away; (ii) bring a legal action to collect all amounts owed; and/or (iii) take any action allowed by law. We may also reduce your Credit Limit or 
close your account at any time whether or not you are in default. 

24. COLLECTION COSTS. If we ask an attorney to collect your account, we may charge you our collection costs. Collection costs may include court costs and reasonable attorneys� fees. We will charge these costs only if the attorney we ask to collect is not our salaried employee and the law allows us to do so. 

25. DISPUTE AND CLAIM RESOLUTION (INCLUDING ARBITRATION) PROVISION. 

General/Requirement to Arbitrate. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED. This Provision replaces any existing arbitration provision with us and will stay in force no matter what happens to your Account, including termination. 

Upon demand, and except as otherwise provided below, you and we must arbitrate individually any dispute or claim between you, any joint cardholder and/or 
any additional cardholder, on the one hand; and us, our affiliates, and agents on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises from or relates to your Account. 

However, we will not require you to arbitrate: (1) any individual case in small claims court or your state�s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court; or (2) any claim by us that only involves our effort to collect money you owe us. However, if you respond to a collection lawsuit by claiming that we engaged in any wrongdoing, we may require you to arbitrate. 

YOU AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. ALSO, YOU MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ON BEHALF OF ANY CARDHOLDER WHO IS NOT A JOINT OR ADDITIONAL CARDHOLDER WITH YOU ON YOUR ACCOUNT (AN �UNRELATED CARDHOLDER�), AND YOU AGREE THAT NO UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY BRING ANY CLAIMS AGAINST US ON YOUR BEHALF. CLAIMS BY YOU AND BY AN UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY NOT BE JOINED IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. Only a court may decide whether any part of this paragraph is enforceable. If it is finally determined that this paragraph is not fully enforceable, only this sentence of the Provision will remain in force and the remainder of the Provision will be null and void, provided that the court�s 
determination concerning the enforceability of this paragraph shall be subject to appeal. 

Starting an Arbitration. If you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, the electing party must notify the other party in writing. This notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit and can be given in papers filed in the lawsuit. Otherwise, your notice must be sent to GE Money Bank, Legal Operation, P.O. Box 
29110, Shawnee Mission, KS 66201, ATTN: ARBITRATION DEMAND and our notice must be sent to the most recent address for you in our files. The party seeking 
arbitration must select as the arbitration administrator either the American Arbitration Association (�AAA�), 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, 
www.adr.org, (800) 778-7879, or JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018, www.jamsadr.com, (800) 352-5267. If neither the AAA nor JAMS is 
able or willing to handle the dispute, then the parties will resolve their dispute in court. 

The arbitration administrator will appoint the arbitrator and tell the parties what to do next. The arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least ten years legal 
experience. In making decisions or awarding remedies, the arbitrator must apply the same law and legal principles that would apply in court, but may use 
different procedural rules. If the administrator�s rules conflict with this Provision, this Provision will control. 

Arbitration Location and Fees. The arbitration will take place by phone or at a location reasonably convenient to you. Upon your request, we will normally 
pay all the fees the administrator or arbitrator charges, if we believe you are acting in good faith. We will always pay these arbitration costs, as well as your legal fees and costs, to the extent required under applicable law or in order for this Provision to be enforced. 

Governing Law. This Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (the �FAA�). Utah law shall apply to the extent state law is relevant under Section 
2 of the FAA in determining the validity of this Provision. The arbitrator must follow: (1) the substantive law, consistent with the FAA, that would apply 
if the matter had been brought in court, (2) this Provision, and (3) the administrator�s rules. The arbitrator�s decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator�s award. 

Rejecting this Provision. You may reject this Provision, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any dispute or claim. Rejection will not 
affect any other aspect of the cardholder agreement. To reject, you must send us a notice within 60 days after you open your account or we first provide you 
with a right to reject this Provision. The notice must include your name, address, and account number and be mailed to GE Money Bank, P.O. Box 981429, El 
Paso, TX 79998-1429. This is the only way you can reject this Provision. 

26. WAIVER. We may decide to give up any of our rights under this Agreement. This includes our right to impose the full amount of any charge. If we do, we do 
not give up any of our other rights under this Agreement. If we give up any of our rights in one situation, we do not give up the same right in another situation. Except as we may agree in a signed writing, we do not give up any rights if we (a) accept a late or partial payment, (b) accept a check or other payment marked �payment in full",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called �daily balance�. 

During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying 
the periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following 
balance types, as applicable: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or 
special promotions. 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees 
posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type.

1. CONTRACT. This Agreement (�Agreement�) is a contract for the extension of credit. It controls your credit card account referenced on the document received with your credit card or 
on your welcome letter. This Agreement includes this document and the following documents: 
� The application or any other document you submitted to us in connection with the account; and 
� The privacy policy that is enclosed with or attached to this document. 
By opening or using your account, you agree to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement starts when (i) you give us an account application we approve or (ii) you use your account or 
let someone else use it, whichever occurs first. 

2. PARTIES. The parties to this Agreement are you and GE Money Bank. GE Money Bank is located at 170 West Election Road, Suite 125, Draper, Utah 84020. GE Money Bank 
sometimes is called �us,� �we� or �our� in this Agreement. 

3. PROMISE TO PAY. You promise to pay us for all credit that we extend on your account, including credit extended when you let another person use your account. You also promise to 
pay us for all other amounts owed to us under this Agreement. 

4. CHANGING TERMS. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may change, add to or delete any of the terms of this Agreement, including the interest rates, 
fees and charges. 

5. GOVERNING LAW. Except as provided in the Dispute and Claim Resolution (Including Arbitration) provision, this Agreement and your account are governed by federal 
law and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of Utah without regard to its conflicts of law principles. This Agreement has been accepted by us in Utah. 

6. CREDIT CARD. We have issued or will send you a credit card for your use. You are not permitted to allow anyone else to use your credit card, but if you do, you will be responsible 
for such use. You will destroy all the credit card(s) issued on your account if we ask you to do so. 

7. AUTHORIZED USER/JOINT ACCOUNT. If you ask us to send a credit card to another person that you want to let use your account, you will be responsible for all transactions made 
by that person. That person will be considered an authorized user. If another person is approved on the account, that person will be considered a joint accountholder. Each joint 
accountholder may use the account and agrees to the terms of this Agreement. No matter which joint accountholder uses the account, each of you must pay back the full amount owed 
on the account. We may treat each of you as one accountholder. For example, giving notice to one of you is considered the same as giving notice to both of you. Also, we may follow the 
instructions that we get from one of you even if they differ from instructions given by the other accountholder. 

8. USING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may use your account only as stated in this Agreement. You may use your account for the following: 
� Purchases. You may buy goods or services; 
� Cash Advances. If applicable, you may get cash advances by writing convenience checks we may provide to you from time to time or by other means we may make available. We 
may not honor a convenience check (i) if you filed for bankruptcy, (ii) if the check is expired, (iii) if your account is closed, (iv) if the amount of the check would exceed your available 
credit or cash advance limit, or (v) as otherwise stated on your convenience check; and 
� Balance Transfers. If applicable, from time to time, we may offer you the chance to transfer balances from your other credit card accounts to this account. Unless we tell you 
otherwise, we will treat balance transfers as purchases. We reserve the right to decline to process any balance transfer request for any reason, and will not transfer a balance from 
any of our affiliates. Transfers will be processed in the order determined by us. If the amount you wish to transfer is greater than your available credit limit, we may reject the 
request(s). It may take up to four weeks for a balance transfer request to be credited to your other credit card account(s). It is your responsibility to make any payments required to 
keep your other account(s) current and to close your other account(s), if you desire. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur on your other account(s) as a result of 
your balance transfer(s). If you have a dispute with a creditor, and pay the balance in question by transferring it to your account, you may lose certain dispute rights. 
You may use your account only for lawful personal, family or household purposes. You may not use your account for internet gambling or illegal purposes. You may not use your account 
to pay amounts you owe us on this account or on other accounts you have with us. These restrictions are for our benefit, and we are not responsible to you for enforcing them. 

9. CREDIT AND CASH ADVANCE LIMITS. 
A. Assigning Limits. We will assign the following limit(s) on your account, as applicable. We may increase or decrease either or both of these limits at any time. 
Credit Limit � This is the highest amount of total credit we will extend to you on your account. 

Cash Advance Limit � This is the highest amount of credit we will extend to you for cash advances made on your account, if applicable. Cash transactions will also count 
towards your credit limit. 

B. Exceeding Limits. We may refuse to authorize you to use your account if that use (including any fees associated with that use) will cause the total you will owe on your account to 
be more than your credit limit. If applicable, you may not get a cash advance if that cash advance (including interest and cash advance fees) will cause the total you will owe for 
cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit. If we approve a transaction that causes the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit 
limit or, if applicable, the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit, we do not give up any of our rights under this Agreement 
and we do not treat it as an increase in your credit limit or, if applicable, cash advance limit. 

C. Limiting Transactions. We reserve the right to not approve transactions on your account. To prevent fraud, we may also limit the number or dollar amount of transactions you can 
make in a particular amount of time. 

10. INTEREST. This section explains (i) the interest rates that will apply to your account, (ii) when interest will be charged on your account, and (iii) how the amount of interest is calculated. 
A. Rates. The following rates apply to purchases and, if applicable, cash advances. A higher rate, which we call a �Penalty APR� may apply at certain times as described below. The 
Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account are shown in the table above and will also be shown on your billing statement. 
We calculate interest on the balance of your account each day. We use a daily rate to calculate the interest each day. The daily rate is equal to the APR divided by 365. 

1. Purchase Rate. The daily rate for purchases is .07394% (APR 26.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
2. Cash Advance Rate. The daily rate for cash advances is .08216% (APR 29.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
3. Penalty Rate. The penalty rate may apply if you do not make your total minimum payment by the payment due date and will continue to apply as provided in this section. As 
required by law, we will provide you with advance notice if we are going to apply the penalty rate to your account and we will tell you when the penalty rate will apply. 

a. What is the Penalty Rate? The daily penalty rate will be .08216% (APR 29.99%). 
b. How Long Will the Penalty Rate Apply? If you are not more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to transactions made on your account 
after a date specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make all required payments by the payment due date for six consecutive billing periods, 
your rate will return to the standard APR; otherwise, the penalty rate will apply indefinitely. 
If you are or become more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to all balances and new transactions on your account not alreadysubject 
to the penalty rate as specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make six consecutive minimum payments by the payment due date, 
starting with your first payment due date after the date specified in the advance notice, your rate for any balances created on your account prior to or 
within 14 days after the date of the advance notice that are not already subject to (or scheduled under a prior notice to be subject to) the penalty rate 
will return to the standard APR. If you do not make these six consecutive minimum payments, we may apply the penalty rate to all balances on your account 
indefinitely. 

B. When We Charge Interest. 
1. Purchases. We charge interest on your purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full, except as set forth below: 
� We will not charge you interest during a billing cycle on any purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the billing cycle or (ii) you had such a balance, 
you paid that balance in full by the due date in that billing cycle. 
� We will credit, as of the beginning of the billing cycle, any payment you make by the due date that we allocate to purchases if (i) you had no balance at the 
beginning of the previous billing cycle, or (ii) if you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in the previous billing cycle. 

2. Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. If applicable, we charge interest on your balance transfers and cash advances (and their related fees) from the date you make the 
transaction until you pay them in full. You cannot avoid paying interest on balance transfers or cash advances or on their fees. 

C. How We Calculate Interest. During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the 
periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types, as applicable: 
purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract 
any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. We charge a minimum of $2 of 
interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest. 

11. FEES. We may charge some or all of the following fees. The table at the beginning of this Agreement shows the amount of each of the transaction and penalty fees. 
A. Transaction Fees. 
1. A Balance Transfer Fee for each balance transfer you make. 
2. A Cash Advance Fee for each cash advance you get. 

B. Penalty Fees. 
1. A Late Payment Fee if we do not receive at least the total minimum payment due on your account by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the due date shown on your statement. The amount 
of the late payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if you have paid at least your total minimum payment due by the payment due date in each of the prior six billing cycles or 
(2) $35 if you have failed to pay at least the total minimum payment due by the payment due date in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the late 
payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for which the late payment fee is assessed, the amount of the late payment fee will instead be equal to the 
amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

2. A Returned Payment Fee if any check or other instrument sent to us, or any electronic payment authorization you provide us in payment on your account, is not honored 
upon first presentment, even if the check, instrument or electronic authorization is later honored. The amount of the returned payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if 
your payments have been honored upon first presentment in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any payment has been dishonored upon first presentment in any 
one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the returned payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for the cycle in which the payment was dishonored 
upon first presentment, the amount of the returned payment fee will instead be equal to the amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

C. Other Fees. 
1. A Returned Convenience Check Fee of up to $35 if we do not honor a convenience check because (i) it will cause you to go over your cash advance limit, (ii) 
you filed a petition in bankruptcy, (iii) the check is expired, or (iv) your account is closed. The amount of the returned convenience check fee will be equal to: (1) 
$25 if your convenience checks have been honored in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any convenience check has been dishonored in any one 
or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the returned convenience check fee would exceed the amount of the dishonored convenience check, the 
amount of the returned convenience check fee will instead be equal to the amount of the dishonored convenience check. 

2. A Stop Payment Fee of $39.99 if we stop payment on any convenience check at your request. 

12. YOUR PAYMENTS. 
A. Required Payment and Crediting of Payment. Each billing cycle you must pay at least the total minimum payment by 5:00 pm (ET) on the payment due date. You may at any 
time pay more than the total minimum payment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payment may reduce the amount of interest you will pay. Any payments received 
after 5:00 pm (ET) will be credited as of the next day. We may delay making credit available on your account in the amount of your payment. 

B. Minimum Payment. Your total minimum payment will be calculated as shown below. We round up to the next highest whole dollar in figuring your total minimum payment. In 
addition, if your new balance on your billing statement is less than $25, then your total minimum payment will be equal to the new balance. Your minimum payment will be: 

1. The sum of the following: 
(a) The greater of either: 
(i) $25; or 
(ii) 3.75% of the new balance shown on your billing statement (excluding any balance attributable to any special promotion that involves 
delayed or special payments); PLUS 

(b) Any past due amounts; PLUS 
(c) Any payment due in connection with a specific promotional purchase. 

2. If you are charged a late payment fee during a billing cycle, for the next four months, we will make the following calculation each month as long as you make at least the initial 
minimum payment each month. We will calculate if the total of your payments is at least equal to the sum of the following: (A) the interest billed on your statement each month, 
plus (B) 1% of the new balance shown on your billing statement each month (excluding any balance attributable to any special promotion that involves delayed or special 
payments), plus (C) the late payment fee that was assessed in the billing cycle before the four month period. If for the four month period the sum of your payments is not at least 
equal to the sum of A, B and C, then your minimum payment for future billing cycles will be the greater of either: 
(a) the minimum payment calculation shown in (1) above; or 
(b) the sum of: 
(i) 1% of the new balance shown on your billing statement (excluding any balance attributable to any special promotion that involves 
delayed or special payments) plus interest and late payment fees charged to your account in the current billing cycle; PLUS 
(ii) Any past due amounts; PLUS 
(iii) Any payment due in connection with a specific promotional purchase. 

C. How to Make a Payment. To make a payment you must follow all the instructions below and the instructions on your billing statement. If you do not follow these instructions, credit 
of your payment to your account may be delayed up to five days. 

1. Do the following: (a) make your payment in United States dollars by check, money order, or similar instrument from a bank located in the U.S; (b) send the payment coupon 
from your billing statement with your payment; (c) send the payment and payment coupon in the envelope provided with your billing statement to the payment address listed on 
your billing statement; and (d) send only one payment and one payment coupon in each envelope. Alternatively you may make your payment online at the website address 
shown on your billing statement provided you make your payment in United States dollars from a bank located in the U.S. 
2. Do not do the following: (a) staple, paper clip, tape or fold your payment or payment coupon; (b) include any other papers or items with your payment; (c) use a balance 
transfer or convenience check from your account to pay us; or (d) send us cash. 

D. Other Ways to Make a Payment. 
Certain participating stores or providers may take payments that you make to them as a convenience to you. We may not credit those payments 

to your account until we receive them. We may allow you to make payments over the phone as an accommodation to you, but we may charge you a fee to do so. 
E. Disputed Amounts. If you send us correspondence about a disputed amount, you must send it to the address for billing inquiries shown on your billing statement. 
You may not send it to the payment address shown on your billing statement. By �disputed amount,� we mean a payment of less than the full balance on your account 
that is labeled as �payment in full� or similar language, or is given to us as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, or is given to us with other conditions or limitations. 
We may accept these types of payments without giving up any of our rights. 

F. Authorization. 
When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or 
to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon 
as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. 

G. Payment Allocation. 
We reserve the right to select the method by which the required minimum payment is allocated to different balances on your account. Some or all of the 
required minimum payment on your account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. The payment allocation method that we use may result in higher 
interest on your account or reduced savings attributable to any special promotions. Any payment you make in excess of the required minimum payment will be allocated to 
balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs, unless applicable law requires or permits otherwise (such as when your account has a certain type of special 
promotion). 

13. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS. At times, we may offer you special promotions when you use your account for certain transactions. These special promotions will have some terms that 
are different from the terms in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement apply to any special promotion, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the special promotion. We 
may terminate your participation in any special promotion and/or apply the penalty rate to your account balances (including special promotion balances) if you become more than 60 days 
late on any payment due on your account. If this happens, each special promotion balance will no longer be subject to the terms of the special promotion and will instead be subject to the 
terms of this Agreement. A promotional charge may be charged as part of a special promotion. Please see any special promotion advertising (including in-store signs) or other disclosures 
provided to you for the full terms of any special promotion offered. 

14. SECURITY INTEREST. You grant us a purchase money security interest in each item of merchandise purchased on your account to secure its unpaid purchase price until such 
merchandise is paid in full. Solely for the purpose of determining the extent of our purchase money security interest in each such item of merchandise, your payments will be allocated 
first to interest on the account, and then to pay off each purchase on the account in the order in which the purchase was made (if more than one item was purchased on the same day, 
your payments will be allocated to pay off the lowest priced item first). If you made a purchase pursuant to a credit promotion, the balance with respect to the promotional purchase may 
be shown on statements during the promotional period and may reflect a different payment allocation method. In no event will we assert a security interest in the promotional purchase for 
an amount greater than the lowest balance shown on a statement for that promotional purchase. We agree that no security interest is or will be retained or acquired under this agreement 
in any real property which is used or is expected to be used as your dwelling. Should we feel it necessary, you authorize us to sign and file financing statements regarding any vehicle 
purchased. 
For some individual purchases under your account, we may require you to maintain property/casualty insurance on the purchase as a condition of granting you credit. You will be 
informed of any property/casualty insurance requirement at the time you make the purchase. 

15. UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should call us immediately at 1-866-396-8254. 
You will not be liable for any unauthorized use on your account. 

You agree that unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given your card or allowed use of your account. You will be responsible for all use by such a 
person. 

16. YOUR CREDIT REPORTS AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION. 
A. Using and Sharing Your Information. When you applied for an account you gave us information about yourself. You also agreed that we could ask others for information about 
your creditworthiness and that we could ask consumer reporting agencies for your consumer report. We use this information in considering your application. We also use this 
information for any updates, renewals or extensions of credit on your account. We use this information to review and collect your account. We use this information to provide you 
with offers. We may give information about you or your account to consumer reporting agencies and other proper parties. This information may include your performance under this 
Agreement.

payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. 

17. USE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOUR ACCOUNT. We will give information about you and your account to dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals 
that accept this credit card (and their affiliates) and you consent to this. Dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals will use the information in connection with the credit 
card program and for things like creating and updating their records and offering you special benefits. We will use information about you and your account as set forth in the privacy policy 
that is attached to or enclosed with this document.

telephone dialing system and/or an artificial or prerecorded voice when contacting you, even if you are charged for the call under your phone plan. You are responsible for any charges for 
contacting you that may be billed to you by your communications carriers. 

20. TELEPHONE MONITORING. For quality control purposes, you permit us to listen to or record telephone calls between you and us. 

21. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. 
A. When You May Close Your Account. You may close your account at any time by writing or calling us and asking us to close your account. You must send this writing to the

B. When We May Close Your Account. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may close your account at any time and for any reason. 

C. After You or We Close Your Account. If you or we close your account, you must stop using it. You will still have to pay us the full amount you owe on your account. This 
Agreement controls your account until you pay it in full. 

22. DEFAULT. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, you are in default if you: 
� Make a late payment;

� Become bankrupt or insolvent. 
If you default or upon your death, we may, subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law: (i) make the full amount owing on your account due right away; (ii) bring a legal 
action to collect all amounts owed; and/or (iii) take any action allowed by law. We may also reduce your credit limit or close your account at anytime whether or not you are in default. 

23. COLLECTION COSTS. If we ask an attorney to collect your account, we may charge you our collection costs. Collection costs may include court costs, reasonable attorneys� fees 
and fees for repossession, repair, storage and sale of any vehicle securing a purchase. We will charge these costs only if the attorney we ask to collect is not our salaried employee and

on the one hand; and us, our affiliates, agents and/or dealers/merchants/retailers or participating professionals, on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises from or relates to your 
account. However, we will not require you to arbitrate: (1) any individual case in small claims court or your state�s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court; or 
(2) any claim by us that only involves our effort to collect money you owe us. However, if you respond to a collection lawsuit by claiming that we engaged in any wrongdoing, we may 
require you to arbitrate.

CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
1.

If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.

The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other charges or fees, including credit insurance or debt cancellation (if applicable), and all payments and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle.

7. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(iv) a purchase on a Same As Cash Credit Plan if the full cash sales price is paid in full before the promotion expiration date.
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan other than a Same As Cash Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Same As Cash Credit Plan during a cycle, the amount will be the sum of the following daily Interest Charge calculations for the Credit Plan during the current cycle and during each of the prior billing cycles (each a “Prior Cycle”) from the transaction date of the purchase through the current cycle: (i) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for the Current Cycle times the Daily Balance for each day in the current cycle; and (ii) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for each Prior Cycle times the Daily Balances of the Credit Plan for each day during each Prior Cycle.
(e) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) incurred on that day and 4) any late fees, over the credit limit fees, returned payment fees or other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. For any Same As Cash Credit Plan, credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) are not included in the Daily Balance of that Credit Plan during the promotional period. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(f) The Daily Periodic Rate for the Standard Rate will be .06548% (corresponding 23.9% Annual Percentage Rate). The Daily Periodic Rate for the Penalty Rate will be .07644% (corresponding 27.9% Annual Percentage Rate). Your APR may increase to the Penalty APR if we fail to receive your minimum payment with in 60 days when due. You will no longer be eligible for the Standard Rate and all existing Promotional Credit Plans will terminate, and your entire Account balance will be subject to the Penalty Rate. If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the new Penalty APR goes into effect.  If you make the next six consecutive on time minimum payments starting with your first payment due once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APR(s) applicable to your Account.  If you do not make these six consecutive on time minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.
8. MINIMUM Interest CHARGE: A minimum Interest Charge of $2.00 will be assessed for each billing cycle in which an Interest Charge is payable.
9. FEES: We may impose on your Account the following fees, which will be added to your Account when assessed:
a)	Late Payment Fee: A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
	The amount of the Late Payment Fee is shown in the chart below.  In no event will your Late Payment Fee exceed the amount of your Minimum Payment Due.

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - Up to and including $100
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $19
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $19

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $100 and up to and including $500
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $29

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $500
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $35

b)	Returned Payment Fee: A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
	Your Returned Payment Fee is $25.
	In no event will your Returned Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
c)	Research Fees: A Research Fee may be assessed to the Account for each copy of a requested document. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such copies are requested.
d)	Reissued Card Fee: You may be charged $5 each time you request that your credit card be reissued.
e)	Payment by Phone Fee: A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment is requested.
f)	Over the Credit Limit Fee: In the event you exceed your credit limit, you will be charged an Over the Credit Limit Fee of $0.
g)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
10. INSURANCE: If available and you elect any credit insurance coverage, you authorize us to charge the insurance premium for such insurance to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the insurance premium is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the premium is being assessed. Credit insurance charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
11. DEBT CANCELLATION: If available and you elect debt cancellation, you authorize us to charge the fee for such debt cancellation to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the debt cancellation fee is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the fee is being assessed. Debt cancellation charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
12. MINIMUM PAYMENT: You agree to pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due. Your Minimum Payment due is equal to your Minimum Payment plus the Special Repayment Factor for any Promotional Credit Plans with a special repayment factor plus any debt cancellation fees or credit insurance premiums attributable to any Reduced Rate/Special Repayment Factor Credit plans plus any delinquent amounts. The Minimum Payment is the greater of a.) $25 or b.) 1% of your “New Balance” (which does not include balances on Special Repayment Factor Credit Plans) plus billed Interest Charges plus any Late Fees assessed for that month, rounded to the next highest dollar. Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments, which may affect crediting of your payments.
13. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) not drawn in U.S. dollars on funds on deposit in the U.S.; (b) missing a signature; (c) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (d) restrictively endorsed; (e) postdated; (f) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (g) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to HSBC Retail Services, P.O. Box 5226, Carol Stream, IL 60197-5226. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
14. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances. If you have a Same As Cash Credit Plan(s), we will automatically apply payments received during the final two complete billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first to the required Minimum Payment Due and next to the plan(s) that is expiring, in the order of expiration; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0% APR for purposes of determining payment application.
15. CREDIT LIMIT: You agree not to let the Account balance exceed the credit limit established for you by us from time to time. We do not have to honor any use of your Card or honor credit card checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit, but if we do, you agree to repay the amount by which your credit limit is exceeded, plus Interest Charges immediately.
16. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of any merchant to accept or honor the Card or a credit card check.
17. SECURITY: Except as indicated below, you grant us a purchase money security interest in the goods purchased with your Card and in all insurance contracts and all proceeds, returned premiums, mechanical failure and extended service contracts, and refunds of charges for mechanical failure and extended service contracts financed therewith. Each good purchased on your Account will secure the entire Account balance until such good is paid in full. For purposes of determining which goods are subject to a security interest, payments received will be deemed to be applied first to any unpaid insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable), Interest Charges and fees and then to pay for purchases on the Account in the order in which they were made. When sufficient payments are made to repay the portion of the Account balance attributable to the purchase of a particular good, we will release our purchase money security interest in that good. Goods covered by a security interest may be taken from you if you do not pay on time. We may require you to make them available at a convenient place of our choice. We take no security interest in goods where the original purchase price is less than $200 if you live in New York and in goods where the original purchase price is less than $700 if you live in Maryland. If we repossess any goods purchased with your Card, we may charge you our repossession cost including, but not limited to, necessary repairs, storage fees and costs of sale, when and as permitted by law.
18. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your moving out of the U.S. or Canada or providing us with a non-U.S. or non-Canadian mailing address; (l) your becoming incompetent; (m) your exceeding your credit limit; (n) your payment being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (o) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (p) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.

Our address for service of process under this provision is HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., P.O. Box 98740, Las Vegas, NV 89193-8740.
Small Claims Exemption
We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim you may bring in small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration at such time.
Location of Arbitration and Fees
Any participatory arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient to you. On any Claim you file, you will pay the first $50 of the filing fee. At your request we will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the Administrator on any Claim submitted by you in arbitration up to a maximum of $1,500. If you are required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, we will consider a request by you to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, we shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees unless the arbitrator grants you an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in your favor, we will reimburse you for any additional fees paid or owed by you to the Administrator up to the amount of the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual award in your favor. The parties shall bear the expense of their respective attorney's fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, or the fees paid to the Administrator, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein. If the arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the Administrator or for which we are responsible.

If a Claim that is within the scope of the first paragraph of the “Claims and Arbitration Administrators” paragraph above is advanced by or against any third person, and any of the persons mentioned in the previous sentence is involved as a party, then the entire Claim is subject to arbitration under this Agreement, including any Claim by or against any third person.
Protection of Information
The rules and procedures of the Administrator, which you may obtain from that organization, shall govern the arbitration unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will control. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, nor to state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. If you or we request, the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized under applicable law and will use best efforts to protect confidential information (including through use of protective orders).
Parties to Arbitration
Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.” The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver. You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules. In the event of such an appeal, an appeal panel consisting of three arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The panel's decision will be final and binding. Any final decision of the arbitrator or of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as provided under the FAA. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the FAA by any court having jurisdiction.
Consequences of Electing Arbitration
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION.

CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
1. GENERAL: Each person signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application for a credit card account (“Account”) as applicant or joint applicant applies for an Account with HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., a national banking association, and requests one or more credit card(s) bearing the name or tradename of Northern Tool & Equipment to be used in connection with the Account. The word “Card” means any credit card(s) issued to you or an authorized user of your Account. In this Agreement, the words “you” and “your” refer to the applicant and joint applicant named on the credit card application and the words “we”, “us” and “our” refer to HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., located at 1111 Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144.
If your application is approved, “applicant” will be referred to as “primary cardholder” and “joint applicant” will be referred to as “secondary cardholder” for purposes of this agreement.
If we accept your application to open an Account, you agree that you will only purchase goods and services for personal, family and household purposes from merchants which honor the Card.
2. ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT: By a) signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application, using or permitting others to use the Card, b) signing or permitting others to sign sales slips; or c) making or permitting others to make purchases by telephone, Internet, or any other means, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Cardholder Agreement and Disclosure Statement, which includes an arbitration provision.
3. PROMISE TO PAY: You agree to pay all amounts charged to the Account, whether incurred by you or anyone you authorize or permit to use your Account or Card. If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.
4. ABILITY TO REPAY: When you use the Account or permit others to use the Account, you represent that you have the ability and intention to repay all amounts charged to the Account.
5. BILLING STATEMENT: We will send you a billing statement monthly for each billing cycle at the end of which you have a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00, or in which an Interest Charge has been imposed. The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other charges or fees, including credit insurance or debt cancellation (if applicable), and all payments and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle. The billing statement will show the amount owed on your Account. The total Amount owed is called “New Balance” on your billing statement subject to the terms of Promotional Credit Plan purchases, if any, as indicated below.
6. PROMOTIONAL CREDIT PLANS: The following Promotional Credit Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase: a) Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan – no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase for a specified period, as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; b) Same As Cash/Monthly Payment Credit Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase before the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, Interest Charges will be imposed from the purchase date; c) Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; d) Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan – A special repayment factor will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; e) Special Repayment Factor/Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A special repayment factor and a reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle.  All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Credit Plan are referred to as Regular Credit Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Card. Call 1-888-367-4310 or review the Application of Payments section of this Agreement for information.
7. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(iv) a purchase on a Same As Cash Credit Plan if the full cash sales price is paid in full before the promotion expiration date.
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan other than a Same As Cash Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Same As Cash Credit Plan during a cycle, the amount will be the sum of the following daily Interest Charge calculations for the Credit Plan during the current cycle and during each of the prior billing cycles (each a “Prior Cycle”) from the transaction date of the purchase through the current cycle: (i) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for the Current Cycle times the Daily Balance for each day in the current cycle; and (ii) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for each Prior Cycle times the Daily Balances of the Credit Plan for each day during each Prior Cycle.
(e) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) incurred on that day and 4) any late fees, over the credit limit fees, returned payment fees or other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. For any Same As Cash Credit Plan, credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) are not included in the Daily Balance of that Credit Plan during the promotional period. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(f) The Daily Periodic Rate which is used to determine your Interest Charges and the corresponding Annual Percentage Rate, will be variable rates which may change monthly. The Daily Periodic Rate will be one-three hundred sixty fifth of the sum of the U.S. prime rate published in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal that is in effect on the last day of the month (“Prime Rate”) plus a “Spread” of 21.65 percentage points for the Standard Rate and a “Spread” of 25.65 percentage points for the Penalty Rate. Any changes in the Prime Rate will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle beginning in the next month.
For example, as of the billing cycle beginning September 1, 2011, the Interest Charge for the Standard Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .06822% (corresponding 24.9% Annual Percentage Rate) and the Interest Charge for the Penalty Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .07918% (corresponding 28.9% Annual Percentage Rate). An increase in the Prime Rate will increase your applicable Daily Periodic Rate which may increase the Interest Charge and the Minimum Payment due on your Account. Your APR may increase to the Penalty APR if we fail to receive your minimum payment with in 60 days when due. You will no longer be eligible for the Standard Rate and all existing Promotional Credit Plans will terminate, and your entire Account balance will be subject to the Penalty Rate. If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the new Penalty APR goes into effect. If you make the next six consecutive on time minimum payments starting with your first payment due once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APR(s) applicable to your Account. If you do not make these six consecutive on time minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.

g)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
10. INSURANCE: If available and you elect any credit insurance coverage, you authorize us to charge the insurance premium for such insurance to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the insurance premium is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the premium is being assessed. Credit insurance charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
11. DEBT CANCELLATION: If available and you elect debt cancellation, you authorize us to charge the fee for such debt cancellation to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the debt cancellation fee is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the fee is being assessed. Debt cancellation charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
12. MINIMUM PAYMENT: You agree to pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due. Your Minimum Payment due is equal to your Minimum Payment plus the Special Repayment Factor for any Promotional Credit Plans with a special repayment factor plus any debt cancellation fees or credit insurance premiums attributable to any Reduced Rate/Special Repayment Factor Credit plans plus any delinquent amounts. The Minimum Payment is the greater of a.) $25 or b.) 1% of your “New Balance” (which does not include balances on Special Repayment Factor Credit Plans) plus billed Interest Charges plus any Late Fees assessed for that month, rounded to the next highest dollar. Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments, which may affect crediting of your payments.
13. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) not drawn in U.S. dollars on funds on deposit in the U.S.; (b) missing a signature; (c) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (d) restrictively endorsed; (e) postdated; (f) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (g) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to HSBC Retail Services, P.O. Box 5226, Carol Stream, IL 60197-5226. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
14. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances. If you have a Same As Cash Credit Plan(s), we will automatically apply payments received during the final two complete billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first to the required Minimum Payment Due and next to the plan(s) that is expiring, in the order of expiration; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0% APR for purposes of determining payment application.
15. CREDIT LIMIT: You agree not to let the Account balance exceed the credit limit established for you by us from time to time. We do not have to honor any use of your Card or honor credit card checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit, but if we do, you agree to repay the amount by which your credit limit is exceeded, plus Interest Charges immediately.
16. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of any merchant to accept or honor the Card or a credit card check.
17. SECURITY: Except as indicated below, you grant us a purchase money security interest in the goods purchased with your Card and in all insurance contracts and all proceeds, returned premiums, mechanical failure and extended service contracts, and refunds of charges for mechanical failure and extended service contracts financed therewith. Each good purchased on your Account will secure the entire Account balance until such good is paid in full. For purposes of determining which goods are subject to a security interest, payments received will be deemed to be applied first to any unpaid insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable), Interest Charges and fees and then to pay for purchases on the Account in the order in which they were made. When sufficient payments are made to repay the portion of the Account balance attributable to the purchase of a particular good, we will release our purchase money security interest in that good. Goods covered by a security interest may be taken from you if you do not pay on time. We may require you to make them available at a convenient place of our choice. We take no security interest in goods where the original purchase price is less than $200 if you live in New York and in goods where the original purchase price is less than $700 if you live in Maryland. If we repossess any goods purchased with your Card, we may charge you our repossession cost including, but not limited to, necessary repairs, storage fees and costs of sale, when and as permitted by law.
18. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Total Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your moving out of the U.S. or Canada or providing us with a non-U.S. or non-Canadian mailing address; (l) your becoming incompetent; (m) your exceeding your credit limit; (n) your payment being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (o) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (p) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.
19. ARBITRATION: 
Federal Arbitration Act
This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1 - 16 (the ""FAA""). The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and provide written reasoned findings of fact and conclusions of law upon written request as set forth in the applicable arbitration association procedures. The arbitrator's award shall not be subject to appeal except as permitted by the FAA. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Claims and Arbitration Administrators
This arbitration provision shall apply to any Claim (defined below) by or against us, or you or any other Covered Person (defined below). You agree any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether based upon contract; tort, intentional or otherwise; constitution; statute; common law; or equity and whether preexisting, present or future), including initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third party claims, arising from or relating to (a) this Agreement, the application, your Account, any transaction or activity involving any payment or failure to make payment on your Account, or any solicitation, advertisement, promotion, or oral or written statements related to this Agreement or your Account, (b) the relationships which result from this Agreement and your relationship with any Covered Person pursuant to the criteria in the immediately preceding subsection or (c) the scope, validity or enforceability of this arbitration clause, any part thereof or the entire Agreement (any of the forgoing a ""Claim""), shall be resolved, upon the election of you, us, or any other Covered Person described below, by binding arbitration pursuant to this arbitration provision and the applicable rules or procedures of the arbitration administrator (the “Administrator”) selected at the time the Claim is filed or received by a party to the Claim. The party initiating the arbitration proceeding shall have the right to select one of the following Administrators: Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) or the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). The arbitrator shall be a lawyer with more than ten years experience or a retired or former judge. The rules and forms of JAMS and AAA may be obtained by writing to these organizations at the addresses listed under Further Information below. Our address for service of process under this provision is HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., P.O. Box 98740, Las Vegas, NV 89193-8740.
Small Claims Exemption
We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim you may bring in small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration at such time.
Location of Arbitration and Fees
Any participatory arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient to you. On any Claim you file, you will pay the first $50 of the filing fee. At your request we will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the Administrator on any Claim submitted by you in arbitration up to a maximum of $1,500. If you are required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, we will consider a request by you to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, we shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees unless the arbitrator grants you an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in your favor, we will reimburse you for any additional fees paid or owed by you to the Administrator up to the amount of the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual award in your favor. The parties shall bear the expense of their respective attorney's fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, or the fees paid to the Administrator, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein. If the arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the Administrator or for which we are responsible.
Covered Persons
This arbitration provision covers Claims by or against (a) us, any corporate parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, any predecessor or successor of the foregoing, and any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of any of the aforementioned, (b) you and any authorized user, and any other person claiming through you or any authorized user, and (c) any other person assisting us in offering Cards, administering Accounts or providing Card related benefits or services (“Covered Persons”). If a Claim that is within the scope of the first paragraph of the “Claims and Arbitration Administrators” paragraph above is advanced by or against any third person, and any of the persons mentioned in the previous sentence is involved as a party, then the entire Claim is subject to arbitration under this Agreement, including any Claim by or against any third person.
Protection of Information
The rules and procedures of the Administrator, which you may obtain from that organization, shall govern the arbitration unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will control. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, nor to state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. If you or we request, the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized under applicable law and will use best efforts to protect confidential information (including through use of protective orders).
Parties to Arbitration
Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.” 
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver. You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules.

(i) ACCOUNT 

This is the Agreement that covers your Banco Popular North America MasterCard credit card account 
(called your �Account�) with us. In this Agreement, and in your Account Statements (each, an 
�Account Statement�), the words �you� and �your� refer to all persons named on the credit card 
application, credit card, or acceptance form, as well as their heirs and executors, and the words �we�, 
�us� and �our� and �Bank� refer to Banco Popular North America. 


 

You can use your credit card (�Card�) to purchase goods and services at participating merchants and 
to take Cash Advances as described in this Agreement. You agree not to use your Card for any 
unlawful purpose. If you use, or allow someone else to use, any Card associated with your Account 
for any other purpose, you will be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us and 
MasterCard� International Incorporated (�MasterCard�) for all amounts or expenses either Banco 
Popular North America or MasterCard pays as a result of such use. 

 

(ii) PROMISE TO PAY 

You promise to pay for (a) credit extended by Banco Popular North America, to you or to anyone 
whom you permit to use any Card associated with your Account; (b) INTEREST CHARGES, late 
charges, and any other fees or administrative charges (e.g., returned check charges) provided in this 
Agreement; and (c) collection costs and attorneys' fees as permitted by applicable law if your Account 
should go into default. 

 

(iii) CASH ADVANCES 

The term �Cash Advance� includes the following transactions: (1) Automated Teller Machine (ATM) 
transactions; (2) convenience check transactions; (3) money orders, cashiers checks, travelers 
checks, wire transfers, foreign currency or other in-bank transactions; (4) tax payments; (5) certain 
permitted gambling transactions; and (6) court costs, bail bonds and fines. Convenience checks are 
used the same as personal checks and are drawn from your Account and billed on your monthly 
Account Statement. 

 

(iv) CREDIT LIMIT 

You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases 
and Cash Advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon 
receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each Account 
Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit 
limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you 
exceed your authorized credit limit, the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return 
or forfeit the Card and close the Account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, 
shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized 
credit limit. 

 

(v) INTEREST CHARGES 

Monthly INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on all balances on this Account. The INTEREST 
CHARGE applied to purchases and balance transfers from other institutions will be based on variable 
Annual Percentage Rates (�APR�). This APR can increase or decrease for each billing period. Different 
APRs can apply to purchases, Cash Advances, balance transfers from other institutions, and 
convenience checks. Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for specific APRs related to your 
Account. 

Variable APRs will be determined by adding the United States Prime Rate as published in The Wall 
Street Journal (�Prime Rate�) to a margin. There is no pre-set limit on rate increases. The amount of 
your margins and current APRs are disclosed in the accompanying card mailer. We determine the 
margins applicable to your Account based on your credit history at the time of approval of your Card 
application. An increase in the Prime Rate will cause an increase in your APR, the INTEREST CHARGE 
and your minimum payment. 

The �Daily Periodic Rate� is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances and is determined 
by dividing the APR by 365 and rounding up. For each billing period, the APR will be based on the 
Prime Rate published two business days prior to the Account Statement/closing date for that billing 
period. In the event the Prime Rate is not available as of that date, we may substitute a similar 
published rate that is outside of our control. To the extent permitted by law, any change in your APR 
will apply to the existing balance on your Account and to new transactions. 

The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances. The INTEREST 
CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the 
number of days in the billing period. 

The Average Daily Balance for purchases is obtained by taking into account the initial daily balance on 
purchases, plus any new purchases, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on purchases, and any 
other fees and charges that we add that day, minus any payments and credits we apply to the 
purchase balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the 
total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. New purchases are added to the daily 
balance on posting date, unless we elect to use a later date. Purchases will begin to accrue INTEREST 
CHARGES on the date of posting. No INTEREST CHARGE will be imposed on a purchase added to your 
daily balance during the billing cycle covered by the Account Statement if that Account Statement 
shows no previous balance or shows that the previous balance was paid in full by its payment due 
date. Also, no additional INTEREST CHARGE will be charged on any Purchases included in the new 
balance of a monthly Account Statement if you pay the new balance in full on or before the date 
specified in your Account Statement. The payment due date will be 25 days or more, depending upon 
the payment due date on your Account. 

The Average Daily Balance for Cash Advances is obtained by taking into account the initial daily 
balance on Cash Advances, plus any new Cash Advances, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on 
Cash Advances, and any other Cash Advance fees that we add that day, minus any payments and 
credits we apply to the Cash Advance balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing 
period are added and the total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. The INTEREST 


CHARGE on Cash Advances, balance transfers and convenience checks will be imposed from the date 
the transaction is conducted. There is no �free ride� period for such transactions. 

Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for other terms which are made a part of this 
Agreement. 

 

(vi) ANNUAL FEE 

If applicable, the annual fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is 
issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the first Card. Please refer to the 
accompanying card mailer for specific annual fee information related to your Account. 

 

(vii) MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 

We will not impose any late charges or penalty fees if you pay at least the minimum payment 
reflected on your Account Statement by the specified �Payment Due� date. If you wish, you may pay 
more than the minimum payment and at any time you may pay the entire amount due for the current 
billing cycle. Send payments to Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 
2938, Milwaukee, WI 53201-2938. 

 

Your payment will be credited as of the day we receive it, subject to any applicable cutoff hour. The 
new cutoff time for payments received by mail, telephone and other electronic means is 5:00 p.m. 
Central Time. We offer the convenience of online payments. Please visit www.mypopularcards.com to 
set up an account and avail of this free online payment service. Payments received by 5:00 pm CST, 
Monday through Friday, will be processed the same day. Online payments received on Saturday, 
Sunday or a Bank holiday will be processed the next business day. If the payment is made at a Bank 
branch during business hours in cash or with a check drawn against the Bank, it will be processed the 
same day. Credit for any other payments may be delayed five (5) business days during which interest 
will not accrue. If your payment due date falls on a weekend or legal federal holiday, the payment 
received will be credited to the account on the next business day and will not be considered late. If your 
payment is received after the payment cutoff time on the due date or any time thereafter, a late 
payment fee will be charged to your Account. Please refer to the back of your card mailer for more 
details regarding the minimum monthly payment and other important terms applicable to your Account. 

 

(viii) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS 

If you pay the required minimum payment of the monthly Account Statement, the payment shall be 
applied in the following way: first to INTEREST CHARGES and the rest shall be applied first to the 
debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances, with the lowest APR and then to the debt with the 
higher APR in ascending order. Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until 
the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required 
payment, the excess shall be applied first to the debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances 
with the highest APR and then to the debt with the lowest APR in descending order. 

 

All payments by mail must be made by check or money order. Payments may not be made by 
attempting to effect a transfer or by using a convenience check from this Account or from any other 
Banco Popular North America credit card account. You agree that any payment you make may be, 
but is not required to be, returned to you without applying it to your Account and without 
presentment or protest, for reasons including, but not limited to, that the check or money order: (1) 
is missing a signature; (2) is drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (3) contains a 
restrictive endorsement; (4) is post dated; (5) is not payable to Banco Popular North America; (6) is 
not payable in U.S. dollars; (7) is not paid upon presentment; or (8) results from an attempted 
transfer or is drawn on a convenience check. You agree to pay any Bank collection fees we incur for 
any check payments made in U.S. dollars drawn on a financial institution not located in the United 
States. All payments made by mail under this Agreement must be received at the address specified 
on your Account Statement. 

 

Any conditional check, money order or any other instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a 
disputed debt or as an accord and satisfaction or containing a restrictive endorsement must be sent 
to us at the Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 2938, Milwaukee, 
WI 53201-2938. You must note conspicuously on the face of the payment that it is tendered for this 
purpose. If you make a payment in any other manner and we accept it, we will not have waived our 
rights to collect any amounts owed under this Agreement. Even though your payment may be posted 
to your Account, we may not restore your available credit or Cash Advance available credit 
immediately. 

 

(ix) MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENT 

The Bank shall mail to you a monthly Account Statement at the end of each billing period in which 
you have a balance in excess of $1. You must notify the Bank, in writing, of any error in the Account 
Statement, within sixty (60) days, following the date on which the Account Statement was mailed. 

 

(x) FEES 

Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

a. Penalty fee: A late fee will be added to the standard purchase balance for each billing period you 
fail to pay by its due date the minimum payment due. Returned payment fees may also be charged. 

 

b. Currency conversion fee: If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, other than a cash 
advance made at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, MasterCard will convert the charge into a U.S. 
dollar amount. MasterCard currently uses a conversion rate in effect one day prior to its transaction 
processing date. Such rate is either a wholesale market rate or the government-mandated rate. 
Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

 


If you make a Cash Advance in a foreign currency at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, the 
amount is converted into U.S. dollars by our affiliate in accordance with its foreign currency 
conversion procedures then in effect. Our affiliate currently uses a conversion rate in effect on its 
applicable processing date. Such rate is either a mid-point market rate or the government-mandated 
rate. 

 

The foreign currency conversion rate in effect on the applicable processing date for a transaction may 
differ from the rate in effect on the sale or post date on your Account Statement for that transaction. 

 

If a transaction is converted by a third party prior to such transaction being processed by MasterCard, 
the foreign currency conversion rate for that transaction will be the rate selected by that third party. 

 

c. Administrative charges: We may charge you a fee to take advantage of certain optional 
administrative services we provide our Cardmembers such as copy of Account Statements, additional 
credit cards or express delivery services. Each time an administrative service is offered to you, any

If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, write to us at: 

Banco Popular North America

In your letter, give us the following information: 

� Account information: Your name and account number.

� At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment 
on the amount you think is wrong. 


 

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not 
required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 

 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 

When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 

1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also 
tell you if we have already corrected the error. 

2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we 
believe the Account Statement is correct. 

 

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 

� We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
� The charge in question may remain on your Account Statement, and we may continue to impose 
INTEREST CHARGES on that amount. 
� While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your 
balance. 
� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 


 

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 

� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any INTEREST CHARGES 
or other fees related to that amount. 



� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with 
applicable INTEREST CHARGES and fees. We will send you an Account Statement of the amount 
you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the 
amount we think you owe. 


 

If you receive our explanation but still believe your Account Statement is wrong, you must write to us 
within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent

the matter has been settled between us. 

 

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you 
question even if your Account Statement is correct. 

 

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Card Purchases 

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your Card and you 
have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay 
the remaining amount due on the purchase. 

 

To use this right, all of the following must be true: 

1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing 
address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. 

(Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to 
you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 

2. You must have used your Card for the purchase. Purchases made with Cash Advances from an 
ATM or with a check that accesses your Account do not qualify. 

3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 

 

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in 
writing at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we

and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called �daily balance�. 

During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the daily rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 

To calculate the daily interest charge, we do the following steps each day for each balance type: 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 

We apply fees among various balance types as follows: 

(a) late payment fees are treated as new purchases; 
(b) debt cancellation fees are added proportionately to each balance; 
(c) cash advance and stop payment fees are added to the cash advance balance; 
(d) balance transfer fees are added to the balance transfer balance; and 
(e) foreign transaction fees are added to the purchase balance. 

� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 

� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 

Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. 

Variable Rate Information 

The prime rate for a billing cycle is the highest bank prime loan rate published in The Wall Street Journal in its Money Rates section on the last business day of the calendar month preceding the first day of the billing cycle. 

If the prime rate increases, the daily rates (and corresponding APRs) may increase. As a result, interest, your total minimum payment and the number of payments it would take you to pay off your account balance may increase. We will apply any change in the daily rates because of a prime rate change to your entire account balance. A change in the prime rate will take effect on the first day of the billing cycle after the change. We may select a new interest rate index if the prime rate is not available. 

* If you make a transaction with your Card in a currency other than U.S. dollars, American Express will convert the transaction amount into U.S. dollars. 
For foreign charges converted by American Express, the converted amount will be increased by a conversion commission of 1% which will be for the account of American Express. 

�� 2.99% Introductory APR for 6 months from the date the Account is opened applies to new purchases made using your Card. Minimum Monthly Payments required. 
Regular account terms apply to non-promotional purchases and, after the promotion expires, to promotional purchases. Payments will be applied to your Account 
in accordance with your Agreement. Some or all of the required minimum payment on your Account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR 
balances. If you have existing balances or incur additional balances at higher APRs, you will not receive the full benefit of this promotion. The reduced APR offer does not apply to balance transfers or cash advances. APRs are accurate as of October 1, 2010. APRs will vary with the market based on the prime rate. 
For new accounts: Purchase Standard APR is 19.99% for Premier Accounts and 23.99% for Choice Accounts. Minimum Finance Charge is $2.00. Offer is subject to credit approval.

7. AUTHORIZED USER/JOINT ACCOUNT. If you ask us to send a credit card to another person that you want to let use your account, you will be responsible for all transactions made by that person. That person will be considered an authorized user. If another person is approved on the account, that person will be considered a joint accountholder. Each joint accountholder may use the account and agrees to the terms of this Agreement. No matter which joint accountholder uses the account, each of you must pay back the full amount owed on the account. We may treat each of you as one accountholder. For example, giving notice to one of you is considered the same as giving notice to both of you. Also, we may follow the instructions that we get from one of you even if they differ from instructions given by the other accountholder. 

8. USING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may use your account only as stated in this Agreement. You may use your account for the following: 

� Purchases � You may buy goods or services from any merchant that accepts American Express� credit cards; 

� Cash Advances � You may get cash advances as explained in section 9 below; and 

� Balance Transfers � From time to time, we may offer you the chance to transfer balances from your other credit card accounts to this account. Unless we 
tell you otherwise, we will treat balance transfers as purchases. We reserve the right to decline to process any balance transfers request for any reason, 
and will not transfer a balance from any of our affiliates. Transfers will be processed in the order determined by us. If the amount you wish to transfer is 
greater than your available credit limit, we may reject the request(s). It may take up to four weeks for a balance transfers request to be credited to your 
other credit card account(s). It is your responsibility to make any payments required to keep your other account(s) current and to close your other account(s), if you desire. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur on your other account(s) as a result of your balance transfer(s). If you have a dispute with a creditor, and pay the balance in question by transferring it to your account, you may lose certain dispute rights. 

You may use your account only for lawful personal, family or household purposes. You may not use your account for internet gambling or illegal purposes. You 
may not use your account to pay amounts you owe us on this account or on other accounts you have with us. These restrictions are for our benefit, and we are not responsible to you for enforcing them.

� Convenience Checks. We may send you convenience checks. We may not honor a convenience check (i) if you filed for bankruptcy, (ii) if the check is expired, (iii) if your account is closed, (iv) if the amount of the check would exceed your available credit or cash advance limit, or (v) as otherwise stated on 
your convenience check. 

� Cash and ATM Withdrawals. You can get cash from any institution that accepts the card or account. You can also get cash by making a withdrawal from an automated teller machine (ATM) that accepts the card or account. In addition to the fee we may charge, the ATM owner may charge you a fee for using the ATM.

include, for example, money orders, cashier�s checks, traveler�s checks, electronic or wire transfers, foreign currency or other in-bank transactions, tax 
payments, lottery tickets or other legalized gambling transactions, court costs, bail bonds and fines. 

10. CREDIT AND CASH ADVANCE LIMITS. 

A. Assigning Limits. We will assign the following limits on your account. We may increase or decrease either or both of these limits at any time. 

� Credit Limit � This is the highest amount of total credit we will extend to you on your account. 

� Cash Advance Limit � This is the highest amount of credit we will extend to you for cash advances made on your account. Cash transactions will also count towards your credit limit. 

B. Exceeding Limits. We may refuse to authorize you to use your account if that use (including any fees associated with that use) will cause the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit limit. You may not get a cash advance if that cash advance (including interest and cash advance fees) will cause the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit. If we approve a transaction that causes the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit limit or the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit, we do not give up any of our rights under this Agreement and we do not treat it as an increase in your credit limit or cash advance limit. 

C. Limiting Purchases, Balance Transfers or Cash Advances. We reserve the right to not approve transactions on your account. To prevent fraud, we may also limit the number or dollar amount of purchases, balance transfers or cash advances you can make in a particular amount of time. 

11. INTEREST. The section explains (i) the interest rates that will apply to your account, (ii) when interest will be charged on your account, and (iii) how the amount of interest is calculated. 

A. Rates. The following rates apply to purchases, balance transfers and cash advances. The Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account are 
shown in the table at the beginning of this Agreement and will also be shown on your billing statement. 

We calculate interest on the balance of your account each day. We use a daily rate to calculate the interest each day. The daily rate is equal to the APR divided by 365. All of the APRs and the daily rates on your account vary with the market based on the prime rate. The rates applied during a billing cycle are calculated based on the prime rate. The prime rate for a billing cycle is the highest bank prime loan rate published in The Wall Street Journal in its Money Rates section on the last business day of the calendar month preceding the first day of the billing cycle. 

1. Purchase Rate. 

� Introductory APR: For the first six months starting on the date your account is opened, the daily rate for purchases is .00820% (APR 2.99%). 

� After the Introductory APR no longer applies: 

For Premier Accounts: The daily rate for purchases is the prime rate plus 16.74%, times 1/365. As of October 1, 2010 the daily rate for purchases was .05477% (APR 19.99%). 

For Choice Accounts: The daily rate for purchases is the prime rate plus 20.74%, times 1/365. As of October 1, 2010 the daily rate for purchases was .06573% (APR 23.99%). 

2. Balance Transfer Rate. 

For Premier Accounts: The daily rate for balance transfers is the prime rate plus 16.74%, times 1/365. As of October 1, 2010 the daily rate for balance transfers was .05477% (APR 19.99%). 

For Choice Accounts: The daily rate for balance transfers is the prime rate plus 20.74%, times 1/365. As of October 1, 2010 the daily rate for balance 
transfers was .06573% (APR 23.99%). 

3. Cash Advance Rate. The daily rate for cash advances is the prime rate plus 23.74%, times 1/365. As of October 1, 2010 the daily rate for cash advances 
was .07395% (APR 26.99%). 

4. Daily Rates May Vary. If the prime rate increases, the daily rates (and corresponding APRs) may increase. As a result, interest, your total minimum 
payment and the number of payments it would take you to pay off your account balance may increase. We will apply any change in the daily rates because of a prime rate change to your entire account balance. A change in the prime rate will take effect on the first day of the billing cycle after the change. We may select a new interest rate index if the prime rate is not available. 

B. When We Charge Interest. We charge interest as described below. 

1. Purchases. We charge interest on your purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full, except as set forth below: 

� We will not charge you interest during a billing cycle on any purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the billing cycle or (ii) you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in that billing cycle. 

� We will credit, as of the beginning of the billing cycle, any payment you make by the due date that we allocate to purchases if (i) you had no balance at 
the beginning of the previous billing cycle, or (ii) if you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in the previous billing cycle. 

2. Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. We charge interest on your balance transfers and cash advances (and their related fees) from the date you make the transaction until you pay them in full. You cannot avoid paying interest on balance transfers or cash advances or on their fees. 

C. How We Calculate Interest. During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the daily rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 

To calculate the daily interest charge, we do the following steps each day for each balance type: 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 

We apply fees among various balance types as follows: 

(a) late payment fees are treated as new purchases; 
(b) debt cancellation fees are added proportionately to each balance; 
(c) cash advance and stop payment fees are added to the cash advance balance; 
(d) balance transfer fees are added to the balance  transfer balance; and 
(e) foreign transaction fees are added to the purchase balance. 

� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 

� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 

Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. We charge a minimum of $2.00 of interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest and this charge is added proportionately to each balance type. 

12. FEES. We charge the following fees. The table at the beginning of this Agreement shows the amount of each fee. 

A. Transaction Fees. 

1. A Balance Transfer Fee for each balance transfer you make. 

2. A Cash Advance Fee for each cash advance you get. For ATM cash advances, this fee is in addition to any fee the ATM owner may charge you for using the ATM. 

3. A Foreign Transaction Fee for purchases or Cash Advances you make in currencies other than U.S. dollars and/or in a country other than the U.S., whether or not the transaction was in a foreign currency. 

B. Penalty Fees. A Late Payment Fee if we do not receive at least the total minimum payment due on your account as shown on your billing statement by 5:00 
p.m. (ET) on the due date. The amount of the late payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if you have paid at least your total minimum payment due by the due date in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if you have failed to pay at least the total minimum payment due by the due date in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the late payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for which the late payment fee is assessed, the amount of the late payment fee will instead be equal to the amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

C. Other Fees. A Stop Payment Fee of $20. We charge this fee if we stop payment on any convenience check at your request. 

13. YOUR PAYMENTS. 

A. Required Payment and Crediting of Payment. Each billing cycle you must pay at least the total minimum payment by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the payment due date. You may at any time pay more than the total minimum payment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payment may reduce the amount of interest you will pay. Any payments received after 5:00 p.m. (ET) will be credited as of the next day. We may delay making credit available on your account in the amount of your payment. 

B. Minimum Payment. Your total minimum payment is the sum of the following: 

1. Any past due amounts; and 

2. The greater of either: 

(a) $25; or 

(b) the sum of (i) the interest, (ii) any late payment charged to your account in the current billing cycle and (iii) 1.0% of the new balance shown on your billing statement. 

We round up to the next highest whole dollar in figuring your total minimum payment. If your new balance on your billing statement is less than $25, then your total minimum payment will be equal to the new balance. 

C. How to Make a Payment. To make a payment you must follow all the instructions below and the instructions on your billing statement. If you do not, credit 
of your payment to your account may be delayed up to five days. 

1. Do the following: (a) make your payment in United States dollars by check, money order, or similar instrument from a bank located in the U.S.; (b) send the payment coupon from your billing statement with your payment; (c) send the payment and payment coupon in the envelope provided with your billing statement to the payment address listed on your billing statement; and (d) send only one payment and one payment coupon in each envelope. Alternatively you 
may make your payment online at the website address shown on your billing statement provided you make your payment in United States dollars from a bank located in the U.S. 

2. Do not do the following: (a) staple, paper clip, tape or fold your payment or payment coupon; (b) include any other papers or items with your payment; (c) 
use a balance transfer or convenience check from your account to pay us; or (d) send us cash. 

D. Other Ways to Make a Payment. We may allow you to make payments over the phone as an accommodation to you, but we may charge you a fee to do so. 

E. Disputed Amounts. If you send us correspondence about a disputed amount, you must send it to the address for billing inquiries shown on your billing statement. You may not send it to the payment address shown on your billing statement. By �disputed amount�, we mean a payment of less than the full balance on your account that is labeled as �payment in full� or similar language, or is given to us as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, or is given to us with other conditions or limitations. We may accept these types of payments without giving up any of our rights. 

F. Authorization. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer 
from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be 
withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. 

G. Payment Allocation. We reserve the right to select the method by which the required minimum payment is allocated to different balances on your account. 
Some or all of the required minimum payment on your account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. The payment allocation method that we use may result in higher interest on your account or reduced savings attributable to any special promotions. Any payment you make in excess of the 
required minimum payment will be allocated to balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs, unless applicable law requires or permits otherwise (such as when your account has a certain type of special promotion). 

14. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS. At times, we may offer you special promotions when you use your account for certain transactions. These special promotions will have some terms that are different from the terms in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement apply to any special promotion, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the special promotion. We may terminate your participation in any special promotion and/or apply the penalty rate to your account balances (including special promotion balances) if you become more than 60 days late on any payment due on your account. If this happens, each special promotion alance will no longer be subject to the terms of the special promotion and will instead be subject to the terms of this Agreement. Please see any special 
promotion advertising (including in-store signs) or other disclosures provided to you for the full terms of any special promotion offered. 

15. CURRENCY CONVERSION. If you make a transaction with your account in a currency other than U.S. dollars, American Express will convert the transaction amount into U.S. dollars. Unless a specific rate is required by applicable law, the rates to make conversions from transactions in foreign currencies to U.S. 
dollars shall be based on wholesale interbank rates selected by American Express on the business day prior to the day on which the transactions are processed by American Express, which rates may differ from the rates in effect on the transaction date. Charges converted by third parties will be charged at their rates. The converted amount will be increased by a conversion commission of 1% which will be for the account of American Express. We charge a fee for each 
transaction that you make in a country other than the United States, whether or not the transaction was in a foreign currency. This fee will be equal to 2% 
of the dollar amount of the foreign transaction. 

16. UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should call us immediately at: 
1-866-913-3241. 

You will not be liable for any unauthorized use on your account.

Thank you for being an HSBC Cardmember. We appreciate your business.
AGREEMENT TO TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
This Cardmember Agreement and Additional Disclosure Statement as presently set forth, and as they may be amended, govern the open end line of credit we have established for you (your “Account”).

You and we are bound by this Agreement from the earlier of the time you receive it or from the date of the first transaction, including, without limitation, the placement or posting of any Annual Fee or Periodic Membership Fee on your Account. You may close your Account before using it without paying any Annual Fee, or Periodic Membership Fee if applicable to your Account, when you call us within 90 days of your Account open date at the customer service number on the back of your Card.
USING YOUR ACCOUNT
Account Use Restrictions
You agree to use your Account only for personal, family, household, or charitable purposes. You agree not to use your Account to make payments to us or to any of our affiliates. You agree to use your Account only for valid and lawful purposes. If your Account is used for any other purposes, you are responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us and the Network for all resulting amounts and expenses. You are not authorized to use your Account for any internet gambling transactions, even if otherwise lawful and enforceable.
Types of Account Transactions
You can access your Account using your Card or by other means approved by us to make purchases, receive cash advances, or make balance transfers. We may limit the dollar amount and/or frequency of any type of transaction without notice to you. 
Additional Cards
You may request additional Cards on your Account for yourself or others and you may permit authorized users to have access to the Card or Account number. You are personally responsible for each use of each Card issued on your Account according to the terms of this Agreement. If you permit authorized users to have access to your Account, you must pay us for all charges incurred by those persons, including charges for which you may not have intended to be responsible. You must notify us to revoke an authorized user's permission to use your Account. If you do so, we may close your Account and issue a new Card or Cards with a different Account number. You are responsible to recover from that authorized user and destroy any Cards, checks and other devices that can be used as a means of accessing your Account.
Your Credit
Credit Limit 
The Card must be signed to be used. Whether you sign the Card or not, you are fully responsible for complying with all the terms of this Agreement. We will advise you of the total credit limit on your Account when we first send you your Card. All or a portion of your total credit limit is available for cash advances. Your total credit limit and cash advance limit may change from time to time. We will notify you of any such changes through your billing statement or by sending you a separate notice. If no separate cash advance limit is listed on your billing statement, then the amount of your credit limit available for cash advances is your total credit limit. 
You agree not to allow your unpaid balance (including Interest Charges and other charges) to exceed your total credit limit. We may elect not to extend credit if you have exceeded your total credit limit or if the amount requested would cause you to exceed your total credit limit. If you exceed your total credit limit, you agree to pay us that excess amount immediately. 
Your available credit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days.
For Secured Card Accounts Only
Your credit limit may be less than the amount deposited in your HSBC Bank Deposit Account which secures this Account. An increase in your credit limit may be requested at any time, but such increase may be conditioned, at our sole discretion, on additional deposits to your Deposit Account. Any such additional deposits or accumulated interest in your Deposit Account will likewise be subject to this Agreement.
Credit Authorizations
Some transactions may require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. We may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We may refuse to authorize any transactions at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for refusal or failure by any merchant to accept or honor your Card, or if a transaction cannot be completed for technical or other reasons.
PAYMENT

You promise to pay according to the terms of this Agreement for all: (a) credit we extend on your Account; (b) Interest Charges, and other fees and charges; and (c) collection costs and attorneys' fees to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
If your Account is a joint Account, each joint Accountholder is jointly and individually responsible for all amounts due under this Agreement regardless of death, divorce, other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between you. If any joint Accountholder requests to not be liable for future transactions, we may close the Account.
Payment
Each periodic billing statement you receive from us will identify a Minimum Payment Due. The Minimum Payment Due calculation is disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement.
Recurring Transactions
If you authorize a third party to bill charges on a recurring basis to your Account, we may (but are not required to) provide such third party with your current Account status, Account number and/or expiration date to permit that party to continue billing your Account. We may take such steps even if your Account number changes or if we issue a renewal or replacement Card. To withdraw authorization for a recurring charge in such a case, you must notify the third party. If you default, if a Card is lost or stolen, or if we change your Account or Account number for any reason, we may refuse or suspend recurring charges; in such case you will be responsible for making arrangements to reinstate the recurring charge arrangement and/or for making other payment arrangements.
Timing and Form of Payments
You agree to pay at least the Minimum Payment Due in time to be credited to your Account as of the Payment Due Date. Instructions for making payments are on your billing statement. For a payment to be credited to your Account as of a particular day, we must receive your payment by the date and time and in the manner shown in those instructions. You may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due, and you may pay the entire New Balance at any time.
All payments must be in U.S. dollars. Except for disputed payments, if you pay by mail the payment must be sent to the address shown on your billing statement. If you pay by negotiable instrument, such as a money order or check, it must be in a form that is acceptable to us and must be drawn on a U.S. financial institution. Any check, money order or other instrument tendered as an accord and satisfaction, or which includes a condition, restrictive endorsement or any statement to the effect that acceptance of such instrument shall constitute full or partial satisfaction of a disputed or undisputed debt (collectively, a “Condition”) must be sent to the inquiry address shown on your billing statement. You must note conspicuously on the face of the payment instrument that it is tendered for this purpose. We reserve the right to refuse to accept any payment that is subject to a Condition. If the payment does not comply with the foregoing and we process it, we will not be bound by the Condition.
By sending us a check for payment on your Account, you authorize us to initiate an electronic funds transfer from your bank or other financial institution account according to the terms of the check. This means that your check will be converted to an electronic transaction and your original check will not be returned to you by your bank. Your original check will be destroyed. Your checking or other financial institution account may be debited the same day we receive your check. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic funds transfer, please call customer service at the phone number on the back of your Card. When you use our optional payment by phone service, you authorize us to initiate an electronic funds transfer from your designated bank account or to process the payment as a check transaction. You authorize the amount and timing of each payment. Please retain this authorization for your records. 
Application of Payments
We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your Account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances.
INTEREST RATES AND FINANCE CHARGES
Interest Rates
The APRs on your Account are either fixed or variable rates as indicated on the Additional Disclosure Statement. The APR is divided by 365 and rounded to the next highest hundred thousandth of a percentage point to determine your Daily Periodic Rate. The Daily Periodic Rate is used to determine the amount of periodic Interest Charges. Variable rates are determined by adding a specified amount (“Spread”) to an Index (described below).
Index For Variable Rate Accounts
Monthly Index Information 
For each billing cycle, variable APRs are calculated by adding a specified amount (“Spread”) to the U.S. prime rate published in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal  that is in effect on the last day of the month (“Prime Rate”). If the Prime Rate changes, the new APRs will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle beginning in the next month.
An increase in the Prime Rate will increase your applicable Daily Periodic Rates which may increase the Interest Charge due on your Account and may increase the Minimum Payment Due. Each time any APR changes, we will apply it to any applicable balances. If a different Index is applicable to your Account, the Index will be disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement.
Purchase APR
The Spread (for variable rates), APR and corresponding 
Daily Periodic Rate are disclosed on the Additional 
Disclosure Statement.
Balance Transfer APR
The Spread (for variable rates), APR and corresponding Daily Periodic Rate are disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement. Balance transfers may not always be available.
Cash APR
The Spread (for variable rates), APR and corresponding 
Daily Periodic Rate are disclosed on the Additional 
Disclosure Statement.
Penalty APR
The Spread (for variable rates), APR and corresponding 
Daily Periodic Rate are disclosed on the Additional 
Disclosure Statement.
Your APRs may increase to the Penalty APR if you fail to make a minimum payment to us when due. 
In determining whether to apply your Penalty APR, we may consider the following factors: how long your Account has been open, the existence, seriousness or timing of the defaults on your Account or any other account you have with us; other indications of your Account usage and performance; information about your other relationship(s) with us or any of our related companies; and information we obtain from consumer credit reports obtained from consumer reporting agencies.
If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the Penalty APR goes into effect. If you make the next six consecutive minimum payments once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APRs applicable to your Account. If you do not make these six consecutive minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.
Promotional or Introductory APR
At our discretion, we may offer you a Promotional or Introductory APR for any type of transaction. Any Promotional or Introductory APR offer will be subject to the terms of the offer and this Agreement.
Additional APRs
See Additional Disclosure Statement for any additional APRs that may be applicable to your Account.
Interest and Finance Charges
All Interest and Finance Charges will be added to the purchase balance, unless otherwise specified.
Please see the Additional Disclosure Statement for applicability and amount of the following Interest and Finance Charges.
Minimum Interest Charge. The Minimum Interest Charge is the minimum amount of interest that will be assessed in any billing cycle in which a periodic Interest Charge is payable.The Minimum Interest Charge will be allocated to each category of transactions containing balances subject to an Interest Charge.
How Periodic Interest Charges are Calculated. Periodic Interest Charges are added to the Account when we apply the applicable APR to the balances on the billing statement. We do this by multiplying the Average Daily Balance for each type of transaction shown on your billing statement (for example, purchases, balance transfers, cash advances) by the applicable Daily Periodic Rate. We then multiply the result by the number of days in the billing cycle. Periodic Interest Charges will be calculated using the Daily Periodic Rate in effect on the billing statement closing date.
How Average Daily Balance is Determined. To calculate the Daily Balances, we take the beginning balance for each type of transaction every day, add any new transactions, any previous day’s periodic Interest Charges, any Finance Charges, any fees and charges, and subtract any payments and/or credits and make any necessary adjustments. If a transaction posts after the beginning of a billing cycle, but the transaction occurred prior to the beginning of that billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance and any related Interest Charge calculations may be adjusted to include the transaction amount as of the first day of the billing cycle in which it posts. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original payment or transaction.To calculate the Average Daily Balance, we add the Daily Balances for each day of the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle.
How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases (Grace Period on Credit Card Purchases). Periodic Interest Charges begin to accrue on the date of the transaction and continue to accrue until your balance is paid in full. However, if you pay your entire New Balance by the Payment Due Date in the previous month, you can pay your current month's New Balance within at least 25 days (unless otherwise disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement) of the Statement Date without being charged interest on your purchases.
Paying Interest on Other Transactions (No Grace Period on other transactions). There is no grace period for other transactions including cash advances, balance transfers and credit card checks, unless otherwise disclosed. Periodic Interest Charges begin to accrue on the date of the transaction, and continue to accrue until payment in full is credited to your Account.
Changing Your Billing Cycle. Any request to change your billing cycle date is subject to our approval. You agree that changes based on your request may shorten any Grace Period you may have or increase the time period for which periodic Interest Charges may accrue.
Balance Transfer Fee Finance Charges. Balance Transfers include balance transfers and credit card checks. A Balance Transfer Fee Finance Charge will be assessed on the amount of each balance transfer and credit card check as of the date the transaction posts to your Account and will be added to that transaction balance. 
Cash Advance Fee Finance Charges. Cash advances include all advances to get cash over the counter, through an ATM, or other “cash-like” transactions (such as purchasing a money order, traveler's check, casino betting chip, or a lottery ticket) as determined by us. A Cash Advance Fee Finance Charge will be assessed on the amount of each cash advance as of the date the transaction posts to your Account and will be added to the Cash balance.
Foreign Transaction Fee Finance Charge. A Foreign Transaction Fee Finance Charge may be assessed on the U.S. dollar amount of transactions made in a foreign currency, as of the transaction date. The Foreign Transaction Fee assessed on purchases will be added to the purchase balance, and the Foreign Transaction Fee assessed on cash advances will be added to the cash balance.
If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be converted by the Network, into a U.S. dollar amount in accordance with its operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time the transaction is processed. Currently, Network regulations and procedures provide that the currency conversion rate to be used is either (1) a wholesale market rate, or (2) a government-mandated rate in effect on either (i) the applicable central processing date, or (ii) one day prior to the processing date. The currency conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction or posting date. The Network may change the procedures, from time to time, at its own discretion.

See the Additional Disclosure Statement for any additional Interest and Finance Charges that may be applicable to your Account.
If the imposition of any fee amount specified in your Additional Disclosure Statement would exceed limits established by applicable law, we reserve the right to impose the maximum allowable fee, without waiving our right to impose the full specified fee amount thereafter.
ACCOUNT FEES AND OTHER CHARGES
Please see the Additional Disclosure Statement for amounts of the following fees and other charges. All such fees and other charges will be added to the purchase balance, unless otherwise specified. If the imposition of any fee amount specified in your Additional Disclosure Statement would exceed limits established by applicable law, we reserve the right to impose the maximum allowable fee, without waiving our right to impose the full specified fee amount thereafter.
Annual Fee/Periodic Membership Fee
If your Account is subject to an Annual Fee or Periodic Membership Fee, you agree to pay this fee each year (or other periodic assessment if indicated on the Additional Disclosure Statement) your Account is open, or closed with a balance. You agree that this fee will be charged to your Account.
If you close your Account within the first 90 days your Account is open, the Annual Fee/Periodic Membership Fee(s) are refundable so long as you have not used the Account. The Annual Fee/Periodic Membership Fee compensates HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. in part, for Cardmember services provided or made available to you throughout the membership year.
Late Payment Fee 
A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, and any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date. 
Over the Credit Limit Fee
If you choose over the credit limit coverage, an Over the Credit Limit Fee may be assessed if your Account balance exceeds the total credit limit at any time during a billing cycle.
Returned Payment Fee
A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. cash advance, purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction. 
Payment By Phone Fee
A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment 
is requested. 
Stop Payment Fee
A Stop Payment Fee may be added to the cash advance balance when a payment of a credit card check is stopped at your request. Payment may be stopped on a credit card check by notifying us in writing or by calling us at the telephone number listed on the Account billing statement, so long as such check has not already been processed. A stop payment request must include the check number, payee, amount, and date of the credit card check on which payment is to be stopped. If a stop payment is requested by telephone, the call must be confirmed in writing within 14 days. A written stop payment will remain in effect for six months unless renewed in writing. Written stop payment requests should be sent to the address for inquiries shown on your billing statement. 
Research Fee
A Research Fee may be assessed to the Account for each copy of a requested document. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such copies are requested.

(i) ACCOUNT 

This is the Agreement that covers your Banco Popular North America MasterCard credit card account 
(called your �Account�) with us. In this Agreement, and in your Account Statements (each, an 
�Account Statement�), the words �you� and �your� refer to all persons named on the credit card 
application, credit card, or acceptance form, as well as their heirs and executors, and the words �we�, 
�us� and �our� and �Bank� refer to Banco Popular North America. 


 

You can use your credit card (�Card�) to purchase goods and services at participating merchants and 
to take Cash Advances as described in this Agreement. You agree not to use your Card for any 
unlawful purpose. If you use, or allow someone else to use, any Card associated with your Account 
for any other purpose, you will be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us and 
MasterCard� International Incorporated (�MasterCard�) for all amounts or expenses either Banco 
Popular North America or MasterCard pays as a result of such use. 

 

(ii) PROMISE TO PAY 

You promise to pay for (a) credit extended by Banco Popular North America, to you or to anyone 
whom you permit to use any Card associated with your Account; (b) INTEREST CHARGES, late 
charges, and any other fees or administrative charges (e.g., returned check charges) provided in this 
Agreement; and (c) collection costs and attorneys' fees as permitted by applicable law if your Account 
should go into default. 

 

(iii) CASH ADVANCES 

The term �Cash Advance� includes the following transactions: (1) Automated Teller Machine (ATM) 
transactions; (2) convenience check transactions; (3) money orders, cashiers checks, travelers 
checks, wire transfers, foreign currency or other in-bank transactions; (4) tax payments; (5) certain 
permitted gambling transactions; and (6) court costs, bail bonds and fines. Convenience checks are 
used the same as personal checks and are drawn from your Account and billed on your monthly 
Account Statement. 

 

(iv) CREDIT LIMIT 

You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases 
and Cash Advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon 
receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each Account 
Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit 
limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you 
exceed your authorized credit limit, the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return 
or forfeit the Card and close the Account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, 
shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized 
credit limit. 

 

(v) INTEREST CHARGES 

Monthly INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on all balances on this Account. The INTEREST 
CHARGE applied to purchases and balance transfers from other institutions will be based on variable 
Annual Percentage Rates (�APR�). This APR can increase or decrease for each billing period. Different 
APRs can apply to purchases, Cash Advances, balance transfers from other institutions, and 
convenience checks. Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for specific APRs related to your 
Account. 

Variable APRs will be determined by adding the United States Prime Rate as published in The Wall 
Street Journal (�Prime Rate�) to a margin. There is no pre-set limit on rate increases. The amount of 
your margins and current APRs are disclosed in the accompanying card mailer. We determine the 
margins applicable to your Account based on your credit history at the time of approval of your Card 
application. An increase in the Prime Rate will cause an increase in your APR, the INTEREST CHARGE 
and your minimum payment. 

The �Daily Periodic Rate� is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances and is determined 
by dividing the APR by 365 and rounding up. For each billing period, the APR will be based on the 
Prime Rate published two business days prior to the Account Statement/closing date for that billing 
period. In the event the Prime Rate is not available as of that date, we may substitute a similar 
published rate that is outside of our control. To the extent permitted by law, any change in your APR 
will apply to the existing balance on your Account and to new transactions. 

The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances. The INTEREST 
CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the 
number of days in the billing period. 

The Average Daily Balance for purchases is obtained by taking into account the initial daily balance on 
purchases, plus any new purchases, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on purchases, and any 
other fees and charges that we add that day, minus any payments and credits we apply to the 
purchase balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the 
total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. New purchases are added to the daily 
balance on posting date, unless we elect to use a later date. Purchases will begin to accrue INTEREST 
CHARGES on the date of posting. No INTEREST CHARGE will be imposed on a purchase added to your 
daily balance during the billing cycle covered by the Account Statement if that Account Statement 
shows no previous balance or shows that the previous balance was paid in full by its payment due 
date. Also, no additional INTEREST CHARGE will be charged on any purchases included in the new 
balance of a monthly Account Statement if you pay the new balance in full on or before the date 
specified in your Account Statement. The payment due date will be 25 days or more, depending upon 
the payment due date on your Account. 

The Average Daily Balance for Cash Advances is obtained by taking into account the initial daily 
balance on Cash Advances, plus any new Cash Advances, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on 
Cash Advances, and any other Cash Advance fees that we add that day, minus any payments and 
credits we apply to the Cash Advance balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing 
period are added and the total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. The INTEREST 


CHARGE on Cash Advances, balance transfers and convenience checks will be imposed from the date 
the transaction is conducted. There is no �free ride� period for such transactions. 

Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for other terms which are made a part of this 
Agreement. 

 

(vi) ANNUAL FEE 

If applicable, the annual fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is 
issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the first Card. Please refer to the 
accompanying card mailer for specific annual fee information related to your Account. 

 

(vii) MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 

We will not impose any late charges or penalty fees if you pay at least the minimum payment 
reflected on your Account Statement by the specified �Payment Due� date. If you wish, you may pay 
more than the minimum payment and at any time you may pay the entire amount due for the current 
billing cycle. Send payments to Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 
2938, Milwaukee, WI 53201-2938. 

 

Your payment will be credited as of the day we receive it, subject to any applicable cutoff hour. The 
new cutoff time for payments received by mail, telephone and other electronic means is 5:00 p.m. 
Central Time. We offer the convenience of online payments. Please visit www.mypopularcards.com to 
set up an account and avail of this free online payment service. Payments received by 5:00 pm CST, 
Monday through Friday, will be processed the same day. Online payments received on Saturday, 
Sunday or a Bank holiday will be processed the next business day. If the payment is made at a Bank 
branch during business hours in cash or with a check drawn against the Bank, it will be processed the 
same day. Credit for any other payments may be delayed five (5) business days during which interest 
will not accrue. If your payment due date falls on a weekend or legal federal holiday, the payment 
received will be credited to the account on the next business day and will not be considered late. If your 
payment is received after the payment cutoff time on the due date or any time thereafter, a late 
payment fee will be charged to your Account. Please refer to the back of your card mailer for more 
details regarding the minimum monthly payment and other important terms applicable to your Account. 

 

(viii) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS 

If you pay the required minimum payment of the monthly Account Statement, the payment shall be 
applied in the following way: first to INTEREST CHARGES and the rest shall be applied first to the 
debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances, with the lowest APR and then to the debt with the 
higher APR in ascending order. Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until 
the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required 
payment, the excess shall be applied first to the debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances 
with the highest APR and then to the debt with the lowest APR in descending order. 

 

All payments by mail must be made by check or money order. Payments may not be made by 
attempting to effect a transfer or by using a convenience check from this Account or from any other 
Banco Popular North America credit card account. You agree that any payment you make may be, 
but is not required to be, returned to you without applying it to your Account and without 
presentment or protest, for reasons including, but not limited to, that the check or money order: (1) 
is missing a signature; (2) is drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (3) contains a 
restrictive endorsement; (4) is post dated; (5) is not payable to Banco Popular North America; (6) is 
not payable in U.S. dollars; (7) is not paid upon presentment; or (8) results from an attempted 
transfer or is drawn on a convenience check. You agree to pay any Bank collection fees we incur for 
any check payments made in U.S. dollars drawn on a financial institution not located in the United 
States. All payments made by mail under this Agreement must be received at the address specified 
on your Account Statement. 

 

Any conditional check, money order or any other instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a 
disputed debt or as an accord and satisfaction or containing a restrictive endorsement must be sent 
to us at the Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 2938, Milwaukee, 
WI 53201-2938. You must note conspicuously on the face of the payment that it is tendered for this 
purpose. If you make a payment in any other manner and we accept it, we will not have waived our 
rights to collect any amounts owed under this Agreement. Even though your payment may be posted 
to your Account, we may not restore your available credit or Cash Advance available credit 
immediately. 

 

(ix) MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENT 

The Bank shall mail to you a monthly Account Statement at the end of each billing period in which 
you have a balance in excess of $1. You must notify the Bank, in writing, of any error in the Account 
Statement, within sixty (60) days, following the date on which the Account Statement was mailed. 

 

(x) FEES 

Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

a. Penalty fee: A late fee will be added to the standard purchase balance for each billing period you 
fail to pay by its due date the minimum payment due. Returned payment fees may also be charged. 

 

b. Currency conversion fee: If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, other than a cash 
advance made at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, MasterCard will convert the charge into a U.S. 
dollar amount. MasterCard currently uses a conversion rate in effect one day prior to its transaction 
processing date. Such rate is either a wholesale market rate or the government-mandated rate. 
Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

 


If you make a Cash Advance in a foreign currency at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, the 
amount is converted into U.S. dollars by our affiliate in accordance with its foreign currency 
conversion procedures then in effect. Our affiliate currently uses a conversion rate in effect on its 
applicable processing date. Such rate is either a mid-point market rate or the government-mandated 
rate. 

 

The foreign currency conversion rate in effect on the applicable processing date for a transaction may 
differ from the rate in effect on the sale or post date on your Account Statement for that transaction. 

 

If a transaction is converted by a third party prior to such transaction being processed by MasterCard, 
the foreign currency conversion rate for that transaction will be the rate selected by that third party. 

 

c. Administrative charges: We may charge you a fee to take advantage of certain optional 
administrative services we provide our Cardmembers such as copy of Account Statements, additional 
credit cards or express delivery services. Each time an administrative service is offered to you, any 
fee for the service will be reflected on your Account Statement. You agree to pay the fee disclosed 
each time you opt to take advantage of an administrative service. These services are optional and are 
not required to be used by you.

INTEREST CHARGES at the contract rate. Balances outstanding under this Agreement when your 
credit line is reduced or terminated will continue to accrue INTEREST CHARGES until paid in full and 
subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. Upon default, we have the right to terminate or 
suspend your credit privileges under this Agreement, to change the terms of your Account and this 
Agreement, may require you to pay your entire Account balance including all accrued but unpaid 
charges immediately as permitted by law and to sue you for what you owe. You will pay our court,

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Account Statement 

If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, write to us at: 

Banco Popular North America

In your letter, give us the following information: 

� Account information: Your name and account number. 
� Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
� Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, describe what 
you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. 


 

You must contact us: 

� Within 60 days after the error appeared on your Account Statement. 
� At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment 
on the amount you think is wrong. 


 

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not 
required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 

 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 

When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 

1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also 
tell you if we have already corrected the error. 

2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we 
believe the Account Statement is correct. 

 

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 

� We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
� The charge in question may remain on your Account Statement, and we may continue to impose 
INTEREST CHARGES on that amount. 
� While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your 
balance. 
� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 


 

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 

� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any INTEREST CHARGES 
or other fees related to that amount. 



� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with 
applicable INTEREST CHARGES and fees. We will send you an Account Statement of the amount 
you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the 
amount we think you owe. 


 

If you receive our explanation but still believe your Account Statement is wrong, you must write to us 
within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent 
without also reporting that you are questioning your Account Statement. We must tell you the name 
of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when 
the matter has been settled between us. 

 

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you 
question even if your Account Statement is correct.

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your Card and you 
have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay 
the remaining amount due on the purchase. 

 

To use this right, all of the following must be true: 

1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing 
address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. 

(Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to 
you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 

2. You must have used your Card for the purchase. Purchases made with Cash Advances from an ATM 
or with a check that accesses your Account do not qualify. 

3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 

 

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in 
writing at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we 
finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount 
and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called �daily balance�. 

During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying 
the periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following 
balance types, as applicable: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or 
special promotions. 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees 
posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 

Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type.

GE MONEY BANK 
CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT 


1. CONTRACT. This Agreement (�Agreement�) is a contract for the extension of credit. It controls your credit card account referenced on the document received with your credit card or 
on your welcome letter. This Agreement includes this document and the following documents: 
� The application or any other document you submitted to us in connection with the account; and 
� The privacy policy that is enclosed with or attached to this document. 
By opening or using your account, you agree to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement starts when (i) you give us an account application we approve or (ii) you use your account or 
let someone else use it, whichever occurs first. 

2. PARTIES. The parties to this Agreement are you and GE Money Bank. GE Money Bank is located at 170 West Election Road, Suite 125, Draper, Utah 84020. GE Money Bank 
sometimes is called �us,� �we� or �our� in this Agreement. 

3. PROMISE TO PAY. You promise to pay us for all credit that we extend on your account, including credit extended when you let another person use your account. You also promise to 
pay us for all other amounts owed to us under this Agreement. 

4. CHANGING TERMS. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may change, add to or delete any of the terms of this Agreement, including the interest rates, 
fees and charges. 

5. GOVERNING LAW. Except as provided in the Dispute and Claim Resolution (Including Arbitration) provision, this Agreement and your account are governed by federal 
law and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of Utah without regard to its conflicts of law principles. This Agreement has been accepted by us in Utah. 

6. CREDIT CARD. We have issued or will send you a credit card for your use. You are not permitted to allow anyone else to use your credit card, but if you do, you will be responsible 
for such use. You will destroy all the credit card(s) issued on your account if we ask you to do so. 

7. AUTHORIZED USER/JOINT ACCOUNT. If you ask us to send a credit card to another person that you want to let use your account, you will be responsible for all transactions made 
by that person. That person will be considered an authorized user. If another person is approved on the account, that person will be considered a joint accountholder. Each joint 
accountholder may use the account and agrees to the terms of this Agreement. No matter which joint accountholder uses the account, each of you must pay back the full amount owed 
on the account. We may treat each of you as one accountholder. For example, giving notice to one of you is considered the same as giving notice to both of you. Also, we may follow the 
instructions that we get from one of you even if they differ from instructions given by the other accountholder. 

8. USING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may use your account only as stated in this Agreement. You may use your account for the following: 
� Purchases. You may buy goods or services; 
� Cash Advances. If applicable, you may get cash advances by writing convenience checks we may provide to you from time to time or by other means we may make available. We 
may not honor a convenience check (i) if you filed for bankruptcy, (ii) if the check is expired, (iii) if your account is closed, (iv) if the amount of the check would exceed your available 
credit or cash advance limit, or (v) as otherwise stated on your convenience check; and 
� Balance Transfers. If applicable, from time to time, we may offer you the chance to transfer balances from your other credit card accounts to this account. Unless we tell you 
otherwise, we will treat balance transfers as purchases. We reserve the right to decline to process any balance transfer request for any reason, and will not transfer a balance from 
any of our affiliates. Transfers will be processed in the order determined by us. If the amount you wish to transfer is greater than your available credit limit, we may reject the 
request(s). It may take up to four weeks for a balance transfer request to be credited to your other credit card account(s). It is your responsibility to make any payments required to 
keep your other account(s) current and to close your other account(s), if you desire. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur on your other account(s) as a result of 
your balance transfer(s). If you have a dispute with a creditor, and pay the balance in question by transferring it to your account, you may lose certain dispute rights. 
You may use your account only for lawful personal, family or household purposes. You may not use your account for internet gambling or illegal purposes. You may not use your account 
to pay amounts you owe us on this account or on other accounts you have with us. These restrictions are for our benefit, and we are not responsible to you for enforcing them. 

9. CREDIT AND CASH ADVANCE LIMITS. 
A. Assigning Limits. We will assign the following limit(s) on your account, as applicable. We may increase or decrease either or both of these limits at any time. 
Credit Limit � This is the highest amount of total credit we will extend to you on your account. 

Cash Advance Limit � This is the highest amount of credit we will extend to you for cash advances made on your account, if applicable. Cash transactions will also count 
towards your credit limit. 

B. Exceeding Limits. 
We may refuse to authorize you to use your account if that use (including any fees associated with that use) will cause the total you will owe on your account to 
be more than your credit limit. If applicable, you may not get a cash advance if that cash advance (including interest and cash advance fees) will cause the total you will owe for 
cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit. If we approve a transaction that causes the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit 
limit or, if applicable, the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit, we do not give up any of our rights under this Agreement 
and we do not treat it as an increase in your credit limit or, if applicable, cash advance limit. 

C. Limiting Transactions. We reserve the right to not approve transactions on your account. To prevent fraud, we may also limit the number or dollar amount of transactions you can 
make in a particular amount of time. 

10. INTEREST. This section explains (i) the interest rates that will apply to your account, (ii) when interest will be charged on your account, and (iii) how the amount of interest is 
calculated. 
A. Rates. The following rates apply to purchases and, if applicable, cash advances. A higher rate, which we call a �Penalty APR� may apply at certain times as described below. The 
Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account are shown in the table above and will also be shown on your billing statement. 
We calculate interest on the balance of your account each day. We use a daily rate to calculate the interest each day. The daily rate is equal to the APR divided by 365. 


1. Purchase Rate. The daily rate for purchases is .08216% (APR 29.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
2. Cash Advance Rate. The daily rate for cash advances is .08216% (APR 29.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
3. Penalty Rate. The penalty rate may apply if you do not make your total minimum payment by the payment due date and will continue to apply as provided in this section. As 
required by law, we will provide you with advance notice if we are going to apply the penalty rate to your account and we will tell you when the penalty rate will apply. 

a. What is the Penalty Rate? The daily penalty rate will be .08216% (APR 29.99%). 
b. How Long Will the Penalty Rate Apply? If you are not more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to transactions made on your account after a date 
specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make all required payments by the payment due date for six consecutive billing periods, your rate will return to the 
standard APR; otherwise, the penalty rate will apply indefinitely. 
If you are or become more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to all balances and new transactions on your account not already subject to the penalty 
rate as specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make six consecutive minimum payments by the payment due date, starting with your first payment due 
date after the date specified in the advance notice, your rate for any balances created on your account prior to or within 14 days after the date of the advance notice 
that are not already subject to (or scheduled under a prior notice to be subject to) the penalty rate will return to the standard APR. If you do not make these six consecutive 
minimum payments, we may apply the penalty rate to all balances on your account indefinitely. 

B. When We Charge Interest. 
1. Purchases. We charge interest on your purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full, except as set forth below: 
� We will not charge you interest during a billing cycle on any purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the billing cycle or (ii) you had such a balance, you paid 
that balance in full by the due date in that billing cycle. 
� We will credit, as of the beginning of the billing cycle, any payment you make by the due date that we allocate to purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the 
previous billing cycle, or (ii) if you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in the previous billing cycle. 

2. Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. If applicable, we charge interest on your balance transfers and cash advances (and their related fees) from the date you make the 
transaction until you pay them in full. You cannot avoid paying interest on balance transfers or cash advances or on their fees. 

C. How We Calculate Interest. During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the 
periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types, as applicable: 
purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 
� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract 
any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. We charge a minimum of $2 of 
interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest. 

11. FEES. We may charge some or all of the following fees. The table at the beginning of this Agreement shows the amount of each of the transaction and penalty fees. 
A. Transaction Fees. 
1. A Balance Transfer Fee for each balance transfer you make. 
2. A Cash Advance Fee for each cash advance you get. 

B. Penalty Fees. 
1. A Late Payment Fee if we do not receive at least the total minimum payment due on your account by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the due date shown on your statement. The amount 
of the late payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if you have paid at least your total minimum payment due by the payment due date in each of the prior six billing cycles or 
(2) $35 if you have failed to pay at least the total minimum payment due by the payment due date in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the late 
payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for which the late payment fee is assessed, the amount of the late payment fee will instead be equal to the 
amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 
2. A Returned Payment Fee if any check or other instrument sent to us, or any electronic payment authorization you provide us in payment on your account, is not honored 
upon first presentment, even if the check, instrument or electronic authorization is later honored. The amount of the returned payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if 
your payments have been honored upon first presentment in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any payment has been dishonored upon first presentment in any 
one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the returned payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for the cycle in which the payment was dishonored 
upon first presentment, the amount of the returned payment fee will instead be equal to the amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

C. Other Fees. 
1. A Returned Convenience Check Fee of up to $35 if we do not honor a convenience check because (i) it will cause you to go over your cash advance limit, (ii) you filed a 
petition in bankruptcy, (iii) the check is expired, or (iv) your account is closed. The amount of the returned convenience check fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if your convenience 
checks have been honored in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any convenience check has been dishonored in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. 
However, if the returned convenience check fee would exceed the amount of the dishonored convenience check, the amount of the returned convenience check fee will 
instead be equal to the amount of the dishonored convenience check. 

2. A Stop Payment Fee of $39.99 if we stop payment on any convenience check at your request. 

12. YOUR PAYMENTS. 
A. Required Payment and Crediting of Payment. Each billing cycle you must pay at least the total minimum payment by 5:00 pm (ET) on the payment due date. You may at any 
time pay more than the total minimum payment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payment may reduce the amount of interest you will pay. Any payments received 
after 5:00 pm (ET) will be credited as of the next day. We may delay making credit available on your account in the amount of your payment. 

B. Minimum Payment. Your total minimum payment will be calculated as shown below. We round up to the next highest whole dollar in figuring your total minimum payment. In 
addition, if your new balance on your billing statement is less than $25, then your total minimum payment will be equal to the new balance. Your minimum payment will be: 

1. The sum of the following: 
(a) The greater of either: 
(i) $25; or 
(ii) 5% of the new balance shown on your billing statement (excluding any balance attributable to any special promotion that involves delayed or special 
payments); PLUS 
(b) Any past due amounts; PLUS 
(c) Any payment due in connection with a specific promotional purchase. 

2. If you are charged a late payment fee during a billing cycle, for the next four months, we will make the following calculation each month as long as you make at least the initial 
minimum payment each month. We will calculate if the total of your payments is at least equal to the sum of the following: (A) the interest billed on your statement each month, 
plus (B) 1% of the new balance shown on your billing statement each month (excluding any balance attributable to any special promotion that involves delayed or special 
payments), plus (C) the late payment fee that was assessed in the billing cycle before the four month period. If for the four month period the sum of your payments is not at least 
equal to the sum of A, B and C, then your minimum payment for future billing cycles will be the greater of either: 
(a) the minimum payment calculation shown in (1) above; or 
(b) the sum of: 

(i) 1% of the new balance shown on your billing statement (excluding any balance attributable to any special promotion that involves delayed or special 
payments) plus interest and late payment fees charged to your account in the current billing cycle; PLUS 
(ii) Any past due amounts; PLUS 
(iii) Any payment due in connection with a specific promotional purchase. 

C. How to Make a Payment. To make a payment you must follow all the instructions below and the instructions on your billing statement. If you do not follow these instructions, credit 
of your payment to your account may be delayed up to five days. 

1. Do the following: (a) make your payment in United States dollars by check, money order, or similar instrument from a bank located in the U.S; (b) send the payment coupon 
from your billing statement with your payment; (c) send the payment and payment coupon in the envelope provided with your billing statement to the payment address listed on 
your billing statement; and (d) send only one payment and one payment coupon in each envelope. Alternatively you may make your payment online at the website address 
shown on your billing statement provided you make your payment in United States dollars from a bank located in the U.S. 

2. Do not do the following: (a) staple, paper clip, tape or fold your payment or payment coupon; (b) include any other papers or items with your payment; (c) use a balance 
transfer or convenience check from your account to pay us; or (d) send us cash. 

D. Other Ways to Make a Payment. Certain participating stores or providers may take payments that you make to them as a convenience to you. We may not credit those payments 
to your account until we receive them. We may allow you to make payments over the phone as an accommodation to you, but we may charge you a fee to do so. 

E. Disputed Amounts. If you send us correspondence about a disputed amount, you must send it to the address for billing inquiries shown on your billing statement. 
You may not send it to the payment address shown on your billing statement. By �disputed amount,� we mean a payment of less than the full balance on your account 
that is labeled as �payment in full� or similar language, or is given to us as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, or is given to us with other conditions or limitations. 
We may accept these types of payments without giving up any of our rights. 

F. Authorization. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or 
to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon 
as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. 

G. Payment Allocation. We reserve the right to select the method by which the required minimum payment is allocated to different balances on your account. Some or all of the 
required minimum payment on your account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. The payment allocation method that we use may result in higher 
interest on your account or reduced savings attributable to any special promotions. Any payment you make in excess of the required minimum payment will be allocated to 
balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs, unless applicable law requires or permits otherwise (such as when your account has a certain type of special 
promotion). 

13. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS. At times, we may offer you special promotions when you use your account for certain transactions. These special promotions will have some terms that 
are different from the terms in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement apply to any special promotion, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the special promotion. We 
may terminate your participation in any special promotion and/or apply the penalty rate to your account balances (including special promotion balances) if you become more than 60 days 
late on any payment due on your account. If this happens, each special promotion balance will no longer be subject to the terms of the special promotion and will instead be subject to the 
terms of this Agreement. A promotional charge may be charged as part of a special promotion. Please see any special promotion advertising (including in-store signs) or other disclosures 
provided to you for the full terms of any special promotion offered. 

14. SECURITY INTEREST. You grant us a purchase money security interest in each item of merchandise purchased on your account to secure its unpaid purchase price until such 
merchandise is paid in full. Solely for the purpose of determining the extent of our purchase money security interest in each such item of merchandise, your payments will be allocated 
first to interest on the account, and then to pay off each purchase on the account in the order in which the purchase was made (if more than one item was purchased on the same day, 
your payments will be allocated to pay off the lowest priced item first). If you made a purchase pursuant to a credit promotion, the balance with respect to the promotional purchase may 
be shown on statements during the promotional period and may reflect a different payment allocation method. In no event will we assert a security interest in the promotional purchase for 
an amount greater than the lowest balance shown on a statement for that promotional purchase. We agree that no security interest is or will be retained or acquired under this agreement 
in any real property which is used or is expected to be used as your dwelling. Should we feel it necessary, you authorize us to sign and file financing statements regarding any vehicle 
purchased. 

For some individual purchases under your account, we may require you to maintain property/casualty insurance on the purchase as a condition of granting you credit. You will be 
informed of any property/casualty insurance requirement at the time you make the purchase. 

15. UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should call us immediately at 1-866-396-8254. 
You will not be liable for any unauthorized use on your account. 

You agree that unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given your card or allowed use of your account. You will be responsible for all use by such a 
person. 

16. YOUR CREDIT REPORTS AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION. 
A. Using and Sharing Your Information. When you applied for an account you gave us information about yourself. You also agreed that we could ask others for information about 
your creditworthiness and that we could ask consumer reporting agencies for your consumer report. We use this information in considering your application. We also use this 
information for any updates, renewals or extensions of credit on your account. We use this information to review and collect your account. We use this information to provide you 
with offers. We may give information about you or your account to consumer reporting agencies and other proper parties. This information may include your performance under this 
Agreement. 

B. Inaccurate Information. Tell us if you think we reported wrong information about you to a consumer reporting agency (also called a credit bureau). Write to us at P.O. 
Box 981439, El Paso, TX 79998-1439. In your written communication, tell us what information is wrong and why you think it is wrong. If you have a copy of the credit 
report that includes the wrong information, send a copy of it with your written communication. We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late 
payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. 

17. USE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOUR ACCOUNT. We will give information about you and your account to dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals 
that accept this credit card (and their affiliates) and you consent to this. Dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals will use the information in connection with the credit 
card program and for things like creating and updating their records and offering you special benefits. We will use information about you and your account as set forth in the privacy policy 
that is attached to or enclosed with this document. 

18. CHANGE OF ADDRESS/PHONE NUMBER. You agree to tell us right away if you change your address or phone number(s). We will contact you at the address in our records until 
we are able to update our records with your new address. 

19. CONSENT TO COMMUNICATIONS. You consent to us contacting you using all channels of communication and for all purposes (including collection purposes), using all contact 
information you provide to us. You also consent to us and any other owner or servicer of your account contacting you about your account, including using text messages, any automatic 
telephone dialing system and/or an artificial or prerecorded voice when contacting you, even if you are charged for the call under your phone plan. You are responsible for any charges for 
contacting you that may be billed to you by your communications carriers. 

20. TELEPHONE MONITORING. For quality control purposes, you permit us to listen to or record telephone calls between you and us. 

21. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. 
A. When You May Close Your Account. 
You may close your account at any time by writing or calling us and asking us to close your account. You must send this writing to the 
address shown on your billing statement or call us at the customer service number shown on your billing statement. We will close your account after we get your request. 

B. When We May Close Your Account. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may close your account at any time and for any reason. 

C. After You or We Close Your Account. 
If you or we close your account, you must stop using it. You will still have to pay us the full amount you owe on your account. This 
Agreement controls your account until you pay it in full. 

22. DEFAULT. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, you are in default if you: 
� Make a late payment; 
� Do not follow any other term of this Agreement; or 
� Become bankrupt or insolvent. 
If you default or upon your death, we may, subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law: (i) make the full amount owing on your account due right away; (ii) bring a legal 
action to collect all amounts owed; and/or (iii) take any action allowed by law. We may also reduce your credit limit or close your account at any time whether or not you are in default. 

23. COLLECTION COSTS. If we ask an attorney to collect your account, we may charge you our collection costs. Collection costs may include court costs, reasonable attorneys� fees 
and fees for repossession, repair, storage and sale of any vehicle securing a purchase. We will charge these costs only if the attorney we ask to collect is not our salaried employee and 
the law allows us to do so. 

24. DISPUTE AND CLAIM RESOLUTION (INCLUDING ARBITRATION) PROVISION. 
General/Requirement to Arbitrate. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION 
WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A 
COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS 
INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED. This Provision replaces any existing arbitration provision with us and will stay in force no matter

on the one hand; and us, our affiliates, agents and/or dealers/merchants/retailers or participating professionals, on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises from or relates to your 
account. However, we will not require you to arbitrate: (1) any individual case in small claims court or your state�s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court; or 
(2) any claim by us that only involves our effort to collect money you owe us. However, if you respond to a collection lawsuit by claiming that we engaged in any wrongdoing, we may 
require you to arbitrate. 

YOU AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. ALSO, YOU 
MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ON BEHALF OF ANY CARDHOLDER WHO IS NOT A JOINT OR ADDITIONAL CARDHOLDER WITH YOU ON YOUR ACCOUNT (AN

GENERAL: Each person signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application for a credit card account (“Account”) as applicant or joint applicant applies for an Account with HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., a national banking association, and requests one or more credit card(s) bearing the name or tradename of The Good Times to be used in connection with the Account. The word “Card” means any credit card(s) issued to you or an authorized user of your Account. 
In this Agreement, the words “you” and “your” refer to the applicant and joint applicant named on the credit card application and the words “we”, “us” and “our” refer to HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., located at 1111 Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144.
If your application is approved, “applicant” will be referred to as “primary cardholder” and “joint applicant” will be referred to as “secondary cardholder” for purposes of this agreement.
If we accept your application to open an Account, you agree that you will only purchase goods and services for personal, family and household purposes from merchants which honor the Card.
2. ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT: By a) signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application, using or permitting others to use the Card, b) signing or permitting others to sign sales slips; or 
c) making or permitting others to make purchases by telephone, Internet, or any other means, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Cardholder Agreement and Disclosure Statement, which includes an arbitration provision.
3. PROMISE TO PAY: You agree to pay all amounts charged to the Account, whether incurred by you or anyone you authorize or permit to use your Account or Card. If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.
4. ABILITY TO REPAY: When you use the Account or permit others to use the Account, you represent that you have the ability and intention to repay all amounts charged to the Account.
5. BILLING STATEMENT: We will send you a billing statement monthly for each billing cycle at the end of which you have a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00, or in which a Interest Charge has been imposed. The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other charges or fees, including credit insurance or debt cancellation (if applicable), and all payments and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle. The billing statement will show the amount owed on your Account. The total Amount owed is called “New Balance” on your billing statement subject to the terms of Promotional Credit Plan purchases, if any, as indicated below.
6. PROMOTIONAL CREDIT PLANS: The following Promotional Credit Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase:   a) Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan – no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase for a specified period, as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; b) Same As Cash/Monthly Payment Credit Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase before the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, Interest Charges will be imposed from the purchase date; c) Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; d) Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan – A special repayment factor will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; e) Special Repayment Factor/Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A special repayment factor and a reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle. Promotional Credit Plans are available only for transactions on which the total amount financed is less than 130% of the MSRP for the unit. All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Credit Plan are referred to as Regular Credit Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Card. Call 1-888-367-4310 or review the Application of Payments section of this Agreement for information.
7. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(iv) a purchase on a Same As Cash Credit Plan if the full cash sales price is paid in full before the promotion expiration date.
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan other than a Same As Cash Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Same As Cash Credit Plan during a cycle, the amount will be the sum of the following daily Interest Charge calculations for the Credit Plan during the current cycle and during each of the prior billing cycles (each a “Prior Cycle”) from the transaction date of the purchase through the current cycle: (i) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for the Current Cycle times the Daily Balance for each day in the current cycle; and (ii) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for each Prior Cycle times the Daily Balances of the Credit Plan for each day during each Prior Cycle.
(e) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) incurred on that day and 4) any late fees, over the credit limit fees, returned payment fees or other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. For any Same As Cash Credit Plan, credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) are not included in the Daily Balance of that Credit Plan during the promotional period. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(f) The Daily Periodic Rate which is used to determine your Interest Charges and the corresponding Annual Percentage Rate, will be variable rates which may change monthly. The Daily Periodic Rate will be one-three hundred sixty fifth of the sum of the U.S. prime rate published in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal that is in effect on the last day of the month (“Prime Rate”) plus a “Spread” of 18.74 percentage points for the Standard Rate and a “Spread” of 25.74 percentage points for the Penalty Rate. Any changes in the Prime Rate will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle beginning in the next month. 
For example, as of the billing cycle beginning September 1, 2011, the Interest Charge for the Standard Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .06025% (corresponding 21.99% Annual Percentage Rate) and the Interest Charge for the Penalty Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .07942% (corresponding 28.99% Annual Percentage Rate). An increase in the Prime Rate will increase your applicable Daily Periodic Rate which may increase the Interest Charge and the Minimum Payment due on your Account. Your APR may increase to the Penalty APR if we fail to receive your minimum payment with in 60 days when due. You will no longer be eligible for the Standard Rate and all existing Promotional Credit Plans will terminate, and your entire Account balance will be subject to the Penalty Rate. If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the new Penalty APR goes into effect.  If you make the next six consecutive on time minimum payments starting with your first payment due once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APR(s) applicable to your Account.  If you do not make these six consecutive on time minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.
8. MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE: A minimum Interest Charge of $2.00 will be assessed for each billing cycle in which an Interest Charge is payable.
9. FEES: We may impose on your Account the following fees, which will be added to your Account when assessed:
a)	Late Payment Fee: A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
	The amount of the Late Payment Fee is shown in the chart below.  In no event will your Late Payment Fee exceed the amount of your Minimum Payment Due.
Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - Up to and including $100
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $15
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $15

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $100 and up to and including $1000
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $35

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $1000
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $35

b)	Returned Payment Fee: A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
	Your Returned Payment Fee is $25.
	In no event will your Returned Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
c)	Research Fees: A Research Fee may be assessed to the Account for each copy of a requested document. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such copies are requested.
d)	Reissued Card Fee: You may be charged $5 each time you request that your credit card be reissued.
e)	Payment by phone fee: A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment is requested.
f)	Over the Credit Limit Fee: In the event you exceed your credit limit, you will be charged an Over the Credit Limit Fee of $0.
g)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
10. INSURANCE: If available and you elect any credit insurance coverage, you authorize us to charge the insurance premium for such insurance to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the insurance premium is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the premium is being assessed. Credit insurance charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
11. DEBT CANCELLATION: If available and you elect debt cancellation, you authorize us to charge the fee for such debt cancellation to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the debt cancellation fee is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the fee is being assessed. Debt cancellation charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
12. MINIMUM PAYMENT: You agree to pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due. Your Minimum Payment due is equal to your Minimum Payment plus the Special Repayment Factor for any Promotional Credit Plans with a special repayment factor plus any debt cancellation fees or credit insurance premiums attributable to any Reduced Rate/Special Repayment Factor Credit plans plus any delinquent amounts. The Minimum Payment is the greater of a.) $25 or b.) 1% of your “New Balance” (which does not include balances on Special Repayment Factor Credit Plans) plus billed Interest Charges plus any Late Fees assessed for that month, rounded to the next highest dollar. Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments, which may affect crediting of your payments.
13. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) not drawn in U.S. dollars on funds on deposit in the U.S.; (b) missing a signature; (c) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (d) restrictively endorsed; (e) postdated; (f) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (g) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to HSBC Retail Services, P.O. Box 5226, Carol Stream, IL 60197-5226. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
14. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances.  If you have a Same As Cash Credit Plan(s), we will automatically apply payments received during the final two complete billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first to the required Minimum Payment Due and next to the plan(s) that is expiring, in the order of expiration; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0% APR for purposes of determining payment application.
15. CREDIT LIMIT: You agree not to let the Account balance exceed the credit limit established for you by us from time to time. We do not have to honor any use of your Card or honor credit card checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit, but if we do, you agree to repay the amount by which your credit limit is exceeded, plus Interest Charges immediately.
16. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of any merchant to accept or honor the Card or a credit card check.
17. SECURITY: Except as described below, we will release the purchase money security interest in a good purchased using the Account when sufficient payments have been made to repay the portion of the balance on the Account attributable to the purchase of the good. Our allocation of your payments to the balance(s) on the Account is subject to federal regulations. In some cases, this may result in some or all of your payments being allocated to other balances on the Account (including those balances which may pertain to a purchase money security interest in a different good, or goods, purchased using the Account). You may contact us by calling the customer service number associated with the Account to request that we reallocate payments (including future payments) solely for purposes of releasing the purchase money security interest in a particular good (“Release Good”). We reserve the right to honor your request, solely at our discretion. We may deny your request, for example, if we believe that a different allocation will provide us greater protection. If we honor the request, it may result in your payments (including previous payments) being allocated in a manner that delays our release of a purchase money security interest in any other good(s) purchased with the Account, and for which there is a balance outstanding, until your payments are allocated in a manner that results in a release of our purchase money security interest in the Release Good.
18. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your moving out of the U.S. or Canada or providing us with a non-U.S. or non-Canadian mailing address; (l) your becoming incompetent; (m) your exceeding your credit limit; (n) your payment being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (o) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (p) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.
19. ARBITRATION: 
Federal Arbitration Act
This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1 - 16 (the ""FAA""). The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and provide written reasoned findings of fact and conclusions of law upon written request as set forth in the applicable arbitration association procedures. The arbitrator's award shall not be subject to appeal except as permitted by the FAA. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Claims and Arbitration Administrators
This arbitration provision shall apply to any Claim (defined below) by or against us, or you or any other Covered Person (defined below). You agree any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether based upon contract; tort, intentional or otherwise; constitution; statute; common law; or equity and whether preexisting, present or future), including initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third party claims, arising from or relating to (a) this Agreement, the application, your Account, any transaction or activity involving any payment or failure to make payment on your Account, or any solicitation, advertisement, promotion, or oral or written statements related to this Agreement or your Account, (b) the relationships which result from this Agreement and your relationship with any Covered Person pursuant to the criteria in the immediately preceding subsection or (c) the scope, validity or enforceability of this arbitration clause, any part thereof or the entire Agreement (any of the forgoing a ""Claim""), shall be resolved, upon the election of you, us, or any other Covered Person described below, by binding arbitration pursuant to this arbitration provision and the applicable rules or procedures of the arbitration administrator (the “Administrator”) selected at the time the Claim is filed or received by a party to the Claim. The party initiating the arbitration proceeding shall have the right to select one of the following Administrators: Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) or the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). The arbitrator shall be a lawyer with more than ten years experience or a retired or former judge. The rules and forms of JAMS and AAA may be obtained by writing to these organizations at the addresses listed under Further Information below. Our address for service of process under this provision is HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., P.O. Box 98740, Las Vegas, NV 89193-8740.
Small Claims Exemption
We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim you may bring in small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration at such time.
Location of Arbitration and Fees
Any participatory arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient to you.  On any Claim you file, you will pay the first $50 of the filing fee. At your request we will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the Administrator on any Claim submitted by you in arbitration up to a maximum of $1,500. If you are required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, we will consider a request by you to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, we shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees unless the arbitrator grants you an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in your favor, we will reimburse you for any additional fees paid or owed by you to the Administrator up  to the amount of the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual award in your favor. The parties shall bear the expense of their respective attorney's fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, or the fees paid to the Administrator, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein. If the arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the Administrator or for which we are responsible.
Covered Persons
This arbitration provision covers Claims by or against (a) us, any corporate parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, any predecessor or successor of the foregoing, and any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of any of the aforementioned, (b) you and any authorized user, and any other person claiming through you or any authorized user, and (c) any other person assisting us in offering Cards, administering Accounts or providing Card related benefits or services (“Covered Persons”). If a Claim that is within the scope of the first paragraph of the “Claims and Arbitration Administrators” paragraph above is advanced by or against any third person, and any of the persons mentioned in the previous sentence is involved as a party, then the entire Claim is s­ubject to arbitration under this Agreement, including any Claim by or against any third person.
Protection of Information
The rules and procedures of the Administrator, which you may obtain from that organization, shall govern the arbitration unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will control. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, nor to state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. If you or we request, the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized under applicable law and will use best efforts to protect confidential information (including through use of protective orders).
Parties to Arbitration
Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.”
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver.  You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules. In the event of such an appeal, an appeal panel consisting of three arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The panel's decision will be final and binding. Any final decision of the arbitrator or of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as provided under the FAA. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the FAA by any court having jurisdiction.

4. CONVENIENCE CHECKS - MFCU may also supply you with personalized convenience checks, which are checks we may make available to you for the purpose of drawing against your Account.  Payment of a check will be treated as a cash advance on your Account.  In addition to the terms in this Section, these Checks will be subject to the same terms and conditions as cash advances.  Only the person whose name appears on the Check may sign it.  We are entitled to return your Check(s) unpaid if there is not available credit in your Account, if your Account is in default, or if your right to obtain further credit under your Account has been terminated.

6. PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER - A Personal Identification Number (PIN) may be issued on all Accounts. This number may be used by you with your Card to obtain a Cash Advance on your Account at any automated teller machine displaying the Card logo or to make purchases at any designated point of sale (POS) machine.  Please keep your PIN confidential and do not write it on or keep with your Card. 
7. DAILY PERIODIC RATE - The daily periodic rate is determined by dividing the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) by 365 days.  APRs are either standard or introductory.
8. INTEREST CHARGES/BALANCE SUBJECT TO INTEREST CHARGE - Interest Charges will be assessed on your Account for each type of balance (Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances).

If you receive a statement that includes new purchases, and we receive a payment by the payment due date for that statement, we will not charge interest on any portion of the new purchases on the following statement, if that following statement shows we received payment of the Previous Balance or the Previous Balance was zero.

An Interest Charge will be imposed on Balance Transfers and Cash Advances from the date each Balance Transfer or Cash Advance is posted to your Account.  If you pay your previous statement New Balance in full by the payment due date, no interest will be charged during the current billing cycle for cash advances from previous billing cycles.

To determine how we calculate your Interest Charges, please contact us at 800.500.6328.

9. CASH ADVANCE � In addition to the interest charge, a Cash Advance transaction fee will be imposed by MFCU for each cash advance request.  Refer to the current Loan Rate Sheet.
10. INTRODUCTORY RATE � An introductory Annual Percentage Rate may be applied to your Card subject to the terms of the offer.  If your monthly minimum payment is not received by its Payment Due Date, or if the introductory Annual Percentage Rate expires, the standard Annual Percentage Rate will be applied to new and outstanding Purchases and Cash Advances.  
11. PAYMENTS - Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement.  You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the New Balance in full.  If you make additional payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your Account has a balance (other than credit balance).  The minimum payment is 2.778% of your New Balance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, or your New Balance if it is less than $20.00.  Effective October 10, 2010 the Minimum Payment will be 3% of your New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, or your New Balance if it is less than $25.00.  MFCU also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit.
12. FEES AND CHARGES - Additional fees and charges applicable to your Card are contained in the current Loan Rate Sheet and are subject to change. 
13. PAYMENT ALLOCATION - When you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the excess amount will be applied first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate.
14. SECURITY INTEREST - If you give MFCU a specific pledge of shares by signing a Share Secured Visa Agreement, your pledged shares will secure your Account.  You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your Account until MFCU agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount.  


Your Account may be secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with MFCU, except as prohibited by law.    MFCU may apply to the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay amounts due on your Account if you should default.  


15. DEFAULT/COLLECTION/ATTORNEY FEES- You will be in default and understand that all available credit under this Agreement may be terminated if:  (1) you do not make periodic payments as required by this Agreement; (2) you do not keep any promise made in this Agreement or any other agreement with MFCU; (3) any information that you give us to obtain an Advance is false; (4) any third party attempts by legal process to take any property belonging to you; (5) you die, become insolvent or a party to any bankruptcy proceedings; or (6) as otherwise provided in this Agreement.  If you are in default, we may refuse to make any further advances or refuse charge privileges to you and declare all sums owed under this Agreement immediately due and payable.  We may accept late payments or partial payments without losing any of our rights under this Agreement.  You understand that if you are in default, we may add to your unpaid balance any reasonable attorney�s fees and court cost, all of which you agree to pay.  
16. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE � LOST STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION - You agree to notify us immediately of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your Card, orally or in writing, by contacting the Card Services Department via mail at, P.O. Box 919023, San Diego, CA 92191-9023 or by telephone at 800.500.6328 or Visa after hours lost/stolen 800.566.5678 twenty four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.   You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your Card.  You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use.  You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your Card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your Card.  In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.  If you furnish your Card or Card number and grant authority to make purchase or transfer to a person (such as family member, friend or co-worker) who exceeds the authority given, this will not be considered unauthorized use and you will be fully liable for the purchases or transfers unless you have notified us that purchases or transfers by that person are no longer authorized.  
17. CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT - MFCU may change the terms of this Agreement from time to time and Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law.  Either you or MFCU may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or MFCU, will not affect you obligation to pay the Account balance plus any interest and other charges you owe under this Agreement.  You are also responsible for all transactions made to your Account after termination, unless the transactions are unauthorized.
The Card(s) you receive remains the property of MFCU and you must recover and surrender to MFCU all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or MFCU.  MFCU has the right to require you to pay your full Account balance at any time after your Account is terminated, whether it is terminated by you or the Credit Union.  If this is a Joint Account, the Joint Accounts section applies to termination of the Account.
18. CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION - You authorize MFCU to investigate your credit standing when opening your Account.  You also agree that we may re-examine and re-evaluate your credit worthiness at any time and we have the right to terminate future advances or reduce your credit limit.  You authorize us to obtain, from time to time, information from others, including but not limited to consumer reporting agencies, concerning you and your credit accounts.  You authorize MFCU to disclose information regarding your Account to consumer reporting agencies and creditors who inquire about your credit standing.  However, we are not obligated to release any such information to anyone unless we are required by law to do so.  
19. RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS - Merchants and others who honor your Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending MFCU a credit which will be posted to your Account.  If your credits and payments exceed what you owe MFCU, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances.  If the credit balance is $1 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically transferred to an open share account after forty-five (45) days.  In the event there is no open share a check will be disbursed.  
20. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS - MFCU from time to time may offer additional services to your Account through a third party provider.  These services and benefits contain certain exclusions and limitations.  It is your responsibility as a cardholder to review the details of these services and benefits prior to accepting additional services.  You understand that MFCU is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.  
21. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS - Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your Account in U.S. dollars.  The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transaction is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date.   The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date.  All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after is it converted to U.S. dollars.  These fees are charged except where excluded. Refer to the current Loan Rate Sheet.
22. JOINT ACCOUNTS - If this is a joint Account, each person on the Account must sign the Agreement (by signing the application).  Each of you will, individually and jointly, be responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement.  This means that MFCU can require any one of you individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement.  Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchase or cash advances individually.  Any one of you may terminate the Account and the termination will be effective as to all of you.
23. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT - This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your Account even though the sales, Cash Advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.
24. WAIVERS AND SEVERABILITY - We may waive or decline to enforce any of our rights under this Agreement without affecting any of our rights.  Should any provision of this Agreement be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, that determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision.  
25. STATEMENTS AND NOTICES - Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the most recent address you have given MFCU.  Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all.
26.  FINAL EXPRESSION - This Agreement is the final expression of the terms and conditions of this Visa line of credit between you and the Credit Union.  This written Agreement may not be contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.
27. ACKNOWLEDGMENT - You acknowledge that you have received a copy of this Agreement.
28. GOVERNING LAW - This Agreement, your credit card line of credit, as well as our rights and duties and your rights and duties regarding them, will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with federal law to the fullest extent possible and to the extent federal law does not apply in accordance with California law, regardless of where you live and use your credit card.  This Agreement is made in California.  All credit will be extended from California and all repayment must be made in California.  The venue for disputes shall be in San Diego County, California.

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS: KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE

This notice contains important information about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

What To Do If You Find a Mistake on Your Statement - If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at: Mission Federal Credit Union, Card Services Department, PO BOX 919023, San Diego, CA 92191 or via secure mail on MissionLink. In your letter, give us the following information:
� Account information: Your name and account number.
� Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
� Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us:
� Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
� At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter - 
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
� We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
� The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
� While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases - If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.  To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at: Mission Federal Credit Union, Card Services Department, PO BOX 919023, San Diego, CA 92191 or via secure mail on MissionLink.  While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

These limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant, or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or services.

In this Agreement and Disclosure Statement the words ��You,�� ��Your,�� and ��Yours�� mean each and all of those that apply for, sign or use the VISA Variable
Rate and/or VISA Fixed Rate Classic and Gold Card(s), or those who authorize another to sign or use the Card(s). ��We,�� ��Us,�� and ��Our�� mean Coast Central
Credit Union.
��Card�� means the VISA Variable Rate and/or VISA Fixed Rate Classic and Gold Card(s) issued to you and any duplicate and/or renewals we may issue.
��Account�� means your VISA Variable and/or VISA Fixed Rate Classic and Gold Card(s) Account with us.
You agree to the following terms and conditions and any amendments thereto. By requesting and receiving, signing, using or permitting others to use a card
issued to you by us, you agree to the following terms:
THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLY ONLY TO VISA VARIABLE RATE CLASSIC AND GOLD CARD ACCOUNTS:
Notice: This Document Contains Provisions For A VARIABLE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE.
INTEREST CHARGE: The INTEREST CHARGE for a Billing Cycle will be the sum of two (2) components:
(1) CASH ADVANCE FEE: One (1) component of the INTEREST CHARGE is the Cash Advance Fee. Cash and other Advance Transactions are
subject to a Cash Advance Fee equal to 2% of the total amount of Cash Advance Transactions, or $10.00, whichever is greater, which are posted to
your Account during the Billing Cycle (not to exceed the maximum rate permitted by California Credit Unions during the Billing Cycle).
(2) MONTHLY PERIODIC INTEREST CHARGE, MONTHLY PERIODIC RATE, and NOMINAL ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE: The second
(2nd) component of the INTEREST CHARGE is the Monthly Periodic INTEREST CHARGE. The Initial Periodic Rate used in calculating the
Monthly Periodic INTEREST CHARGE is the Monthly Periodic Rate indicated on Addendum ��A�� (attached). The Monthly Periodic INTEREST
CHARGE for each Billing Cycle will be calculated by applying the Average Daily Balance (see explanation below) for your account during the
Billing Cycle by the Monthly Periodic Rate. The Monthly Periodic Rate is determined by dividing the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE by 12 and
will change when the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE changes.
HOW WE DETERMINE CHANGES IN YOUR NOMINAL ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE: The nominal ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE may
increase or decrease during the term of this Agreement. Any such change will be based on an increase or decrease, rounded to the nearest 1/8 of 1% point of
the most recent ��Prime Rate�� as published by the Wall Street Journal. This ""Prime Rate"" is available as of March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of
each year (herein ��Index��). If more than one rate is listed under the heading ��Prime Rate�� in the Wall Street Journal, you agree that the prime rate used by us
for purposes of calculating the Index shall be the base prime rate as on corporate loans posted by at least 75% of the nation��s 30 largest banks. In the event
that the Wall Street Journal ceases publishing the ��Prime Rate�� changes in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will be related to a comparable Index.
The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is determined by adding a ��Margin�� to the Index in effect as of each Adjustment Date. The Index and Margin in effect
as of the date of this Agreement are indicated on Addendum ��A�� (attached). We may waive an increase in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE when such
an increase can be made, but such a waiver shall not be constructed as a waiver of our right to increase the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE at a future date
when entitled to do so.
The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is subject to change every three months on the day following my ��Statement Closing Date�� in March, June, September
and December of each year. These dates shall be shown as ��Adjustment Dates.�� The Index in effect in March shall be used to calculate the ANNUAL
PERCENTAGE RATE change effective as of the first day of the next Billing Cycle in March of the same year. The Index in effect in June shall be used to
calculate the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE change effective as of the first day of the next Billing Cycle in June of the same year. The Index in effect in
September shall be used to calculate the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE change effective as of the first day of the next Billing Cycle in September of the
same year. The Index in effect in December shall be used to calculate the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE change effective as of the first day of the next
Billing Cycle in December of the same year. There is no maximum ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE during the term of this Note, except that the maximum
may not exceed the maximum ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE permitted by California Credit Unions at the time of each ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE
change. The minimum ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE during the term of this Agreement is indicated on Addendum ��A�� (attached). Decreases in the
ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE in accordance with the terms of the Agreement are mandatory. Increases in the ANNUAL PERCENATGE RATE in
accordance with the terms of the Agreement are at our discretion. If the ANNUAL PERCENATGE RATE and corresponding monthly Periodic Rate increases
or decreases the INTEREST CHARGE will increase or decrease. Each change in the ANNUAL PERCENATGE RATE and the corresponding monthly
Periodic Rate will apply to any unpaid balance on the effective date of such change as well as to future purchases and advances.
ANNUAL CARDHOLDER FEE: We will assess an Annual Cardholder Fee of $15.00 for each year your account is open, whether or not you use your
account and regardless of the number of cards issued on your account. You can avoid such Annual Cardholder Fee if you terminate your Account within (30)
days after the date of the Periodic Statement in which the Annual Cardholder Fee is posted. Otherwise, the Annual Cardholder Fee will not be refunded in
whole or in part and shall be owed to us by you even if your account is subsequently changed, suspended, closed or terminated for any reason.
THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLY ONLY TO VISA FIXED RATE CLASSIC AND GOLD CARDS:
INTEREST CHARGE: The INTEREST CHARGE for a Billing Cycle will be the sum of two (2) components:
(1) CASH ADVANCE FEE: One (1) component of the INTEREST CHARGE is the Cash Advance Fee. Cash and other Advance Transactions are
subject to a Cash Advance Fee equal to 2% of the total amount of Cash Advance Transactions, or $10.00, whichever is greater, which are posted to
your Account during the Billing Cycle (not to exceed the maximum rate permitted by California Credit Unions during the Billing Cycle).
(2) MONTHLY PERIODIC INTEREST CHARGE, MONTHLY PERIODIC RATE, and NOMINAL ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE: The second
(2nd) component of the INTEREST CHARGE is the Monthly Periodic INTEREST CHARGE. The Monthly Periodic INTEREST CHARGE for
each Billing Cycle will be calculated by multiplying the Average Daily Balance (see explanation below) for your Account for the Billing Cycle by
the Monthly Periodic Rate. The Monthly Periodic Rate and corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are indicated on Addendum ��A��
(attached).
ckc06/10
THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLY TO BOTH VISA VARIABLE RATE AND VISA FIXED RATE CLASSIC AND GOLD
CARD ACCOUNTS:
CALCULATION OF THE AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE: We calculate the Average Daily Balance (the balance which is subject to the Monthly
Periodic Rate) as follows: The Average Daily Balance for your Account for a Billing Cycle is the average of the daily balances for each day of the Billing
Cycle. To calculate the daily balance each day, we take the following steps: We take the unpaid balance (all amounts you owe) at the start of the day. Then, in
the sequence in which the amounts post to your Account, we add the amounts of all debits and subtract the amounts of all payments and credit, which post to
your Account that day. Payments are applied first to any unpaid INTEREST CHARGE from previous Billing Cycles, then to any late charge, and then to the
balance of your Account. Credits are applied to the particular type of debit which is being credited, if any, and then to the balance of your Account. After
applying payments and credits, we subtract any amount of INTEREST CHARGE, and late charge which remains unpaid. Then we also subtract the amount of
any Cash Advance transaction that posts to your Account on that day or any previous day in the same Billing Cycle. The result is the daily balance for that
day. We add together all the daily balances for each day and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. The result is the Average Daily
Balance for that Billing Cycle.
Note that Cash Advance transactions which are posted to your Account during a Billing Cycle are not included in the Average Daily Balance for that cycle,
and are therefore not subject to the Monthly Periodic Rate during that cycle. However, they are included in the New Balance shown on the statement for that
cycle, and are therefore also included in the unpaid balance at the start of the first day of the next Billing Cycle.
Please also note that if the total of the payments and credits, which are posted to your Account by the Payment Due Date shown on a statement, is equal to or
exceeds the New Balance shown on the statement, we will not apply the Monthly Periodic Rate to your Account on your next Statement.
Finally, if any statement shows a Previous Balance that is zero or is a credit balance, we will not apply the Monthly Periodic Rate to your Account on that
statement.
Your Total Periodic INTEREST CHARGE for the Billing Cycle is the sum of the Periodic INTEREST CHARGES on the Purchases Balance and the Periodic
INTEREST CHARGES on the Advance Transactions Balance for the Billing Cycle. This determines your Periodic INTEREST CHARGE for the Billing
Cycle. Actual INTEREST CHARGES (Periodic INTEREST CHARGE, and Cash Advance charges) will be shown on your Monthly Statement.
PAYMENT: You promise to repay us at our office, or at the address set forth on your monthly statement, all sums advanced to you or any person you
permit to use this Account on the terms and the rates set forth herein. Payments will continue until you have paid in full the unpaid balance, INTEREST
CHARGE and any other fees or charges. If your ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is changed (as applicable) pursuant to the provisions set forth above, the
number of payments required to repay the unpaid balance will be affected accordingly. You understand that each payment is applied first to unpaid fees and
charges then to unpaid INTEREST CHARGES, if any, then to the Purchases Balance, and then to Cash Advances.
MINIMUM PAYMENT: Every month, you must pay at least the Current Payment Due by the Payment Due Date shown on your Account Statement. By
separate agreement, you may authorize us to charge the Current Payment Due automatically to your share or checking account with us. You may, of course,
pay more frequently, pay more or pay the total New Balance in full, and you will reduce your interest charge by doing so. The Minimum Payment will be
either (a) 4% of your total New Balance, rounded up to the next even dollar, or $15.00, whichever is greater, or (b) your total New Balance, if it is less than
$15.00. In addition, you must pay any amount shown on your statement as past due and any late charge. Also, at any time your New Balance exceeds your
Credit Limit, you must pay the excess.
Your Minimum Monthly Payment is applied in the following order: (a) unpaid fees and charges, if any, (b) unpaid Periodic INTEREST CHARGE, (c) unpaid
balance on purchases, and (d) unpaid balance of cash advances.
LATE CHARGE: If we do not receive your minimum payment by the due date listed on your statement, you may have to pay a $10.00 late fee.
CREDIT LIMIT: We will establish a Credit Limit for you. You agree not to let the unpaid balance exceed this Credit Limit. You agree to advise us of any
change in your financial condition that may affect your creditworthiness. You agree that you shall update the credit information that you have provided us,
from time to time, on our demand. You may request an increase in your Credit Limit, but Credit Limit increases must be approved by us.
PURCHASES AND CASH ADVANCES: You may make purchases and request advances in accordance with current loan policies up to your Credit Limit.
You understand that all purchases and other transactions requested by you are subject to our approval.
PREPAYMENTS OR IRREGULAR PAYMENTS: Though you need only pay the Minimum Payment in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth herein, you understand that you have the right to repay your loan at any time without penalty. You also understand you will only be charged Periodic
INTEREST CHARGES to the date you repay our entire loan. You may make larger payments without penalty and this may reduce the total amount of
INTEREST CHARGES that you will repay. Any partial payment of your loan will not advance your next payment due date(s). You understand that any
payment that (a) delays or (b) accelerates the repayment of your unpaid balance will (a) increase or (b) decrease your INTEREST CHARGES.
DEFAULT: You will be in default (1) if you do not pay on time or in the proper amount; (2) you fail to abide by the terms of this Agreement; (3) your
creditworthiness is impaired; or (4) you become insolvent, die or are the subject of bankruptcy or receivership proceedings. In the event of any action by us to
enforce this Agreement, you agree to pay the costs thereof, reasonable attorney��s fees, and other expenses. You understand that INTEREST CHARGES at the
Periodic ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE as permitted under this Agreement will continue to accrue until you repay your entire loan.
ACCELERATION AND COLLECTION COSTS: If you are in default, we may demand immediate payment of the unpaid balance, INTEREST
CHARGES, late charges, annual fees and collection costs. You understand that you will be subject to INTEREST CHARGES (at the applicable Periodic
Rate), late charges, annual fees and collection costs under the terms disclosed in this Agreement, until you repay your entire loan. You also agree to pay your
reasonable attorney��s fees and court costs.
RESPONSIBILITY: You agree to repay us according to the terms of this Agreement for all purchases, advances, INTEREST CHARGES, late charges, and
annual fees, if any, arising from the use of this Account by you or any other person you permit to use your Account, even if that person exceeds your
permission. Any person using the Account is jointly and severally responsible with you.
CHANGE OF TERMS: This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your Account, even through the sales, credit or other slips you
sign or receive may contain different terms. You understand that we may amend, modify, add to, or delete from this Agreement any of its terms and
conditions, including the method of application and the amount of INTEREST CHARGES, effective as to any unpaid balance and any subsequent advance, by
ckc06/10
mailing a notice of the change to your last known address. You also understand that any such notice will be mailed at least forty five (45) days prior to the
effective date of the change as required by Federal or other law. Notice of a change of terms is required, but may be sent as late as the effective date of the
change where the change has been agreed to, in writing, by you.
TERMINATION: We may terminate this Agreement upon your default. Either we or you may terminate this Agreement for other good cause. In no event
shall any termination relieve you of your obligation to repay sums already borrowed, INTEREST CHARGES, late charges and fees, if any.
TRANSACTION SLIPS: Your statement will identify the merchant, electronic terminal or financial institution at which transactions are made, but sales,
advance, credit or other slips cannot be returned with your statement. You will retain the copy of such slips furnished at the time of the transaction in order to
verify your monthly statement. We may make a reasonable charge for any photostatic copies of slips you request.
CREDIT INFORMATION: You authorize us to investigate your credit standing when opening, renewing or reviewing your Account, and you authorize us
to disclose information regarding your Account to credit bureaus and other creditors who inquire of us about your credit standing to the extent authorized by
law.
SURRENDER OF CARD(S): The Card(s) remains our property and, if we request, you must surrender to us all cards we have issued on your Account.
LOST OR STOLEN CARDS: To report lost or stolen card(s), the Account Number, PIN or any combination of the three, please call us at (707) 445-8801
or (800) 974-9727, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM. After hours, weekends or holidays call (800) 682-6075. (If the lost or
stolen card(s) is reported to the 800 number, you must still notify us the next working day at (707) 445-8801 or (800) 974-9727).
UNAUTHORIZED USE: You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify
us of the loss, theft or possible unauthorized use in writing at: Coast Central Credit Union, 2650 Harrison Avenue, Eureka, California 95501 or by telephone
at the numbers listed above.
USING THE CARD: To make a purchase or obtain an advance, there are two alternative procedures to be followed. One is for you to present the card or
card number to a participating VISA plan merchant, to us or to another financial institution, and sign or authorize a sales or cash advance draft. The order is to
complete the transaction by using your Personal Identification Number (PIN) in conjunction with the card in an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) or other

Municipal Credit Union 
VARIABLE RATE VISA CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT RETAIL INSTALLMENT CREDIT AGREEMENT 

1. De?nitions: In this Agreement the words �we�, �us� and �our� mean Municipal Credit Union, 22 Cortlandt Street, New York, New York 10007. The words �you�, �your� and �cardholder� mean anyone in whose name a VISA Card is issued. 

Annual Percentage Rate: The cost of your credit as a yearly rate. Finance Charge: The dollar amount the credit will cost you. 

2. Purchases: Your Card can be used to buy or lease goods or buy services any place that honors VISA. The debt that results from a Purchase will be transferred to us. 

3. Advances: Your Card can be used to obtain an advance (loan) at any of our branch offices, at any financial institution which honors VISA or any other authorized location. If you have received a personal identi?cation number (PIN), you may use your Card and PIN to obtain advances at any ATM that accepts your Card. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, such advances shall be treated as Cash Advances under this Agreement. 

4. Convenience Checks: Upon request, and from time to time, we may send you convenience checks for use in borrowing underthisAgreement. Allconveniencechecksyouusewill be treated as cash advances under this Agreement unless we advise you otherwise. You may not use the convenience checks to make payments on any MCU credit card account. You understand that if you use a convenience check to make a purchase and you have a dispute with that purchase, the dispute is not covered by the Billing Rights Summary below. You understand that the convenience checks will not be returned to you. 

5. Purchases Treated as Cash Advances: 	We consider certain transactions to be the equivalent of cash advances, and we reserve the right to treat them as cash advances under this Agreement. Those transactions include using the Card or Account to purchase wire transfer money orders, money orders that are not issued by a ?nancial institution or are not in U.S. currency, travelers checks, casino gaming chips, lottery tickets, off-track betting, wagers at racetracks, and tax payments. 

6. Maximum Credit Limit: We will from time to time notify you of the maximum amount of credit which we will extend you under this Agreement. A portion of your credit limit, called the cash advance limit, will be available for cash advances. We may increase or decrease the credit limit or cash advance limit at anytime. The cash advance limit will be shown on your monthly statement. We will not be responsible for failing to extend credit to you under this Agreement. You agree not to allow the balance on your account to go over the maximum credit limit. We will not extend credit if: 
� The extension of credit would cause the balance of your account to exceed your credit limit or if the balance of your account already exceeds your credit limit, or 
� Anything has happened that allows us to declare your account in default and therefore immediately due, or 
� Your Card has been canceled or suspended. 

If we do extend credit under any of the conditions above, it will be covered by the terms and provisions of this Agreement. We may delay extending credit if you have previously sent us a payment by check or other negotiable instrument which has been returned as unpaid for any reason. 
7. Monthly Billing Statement: 	If you have a balance in your account, we will send you a monthly billing statement. It will show the total amount of your Purchases and Cash Advance Accounts, the ?nance charge, the minimum payment due, and the date the payment is due. 
8a.Finance Charge on Purchases: A finance charge will be imposed on each Purchase from the date the Purchase is posted to your account until the date it is paid in full, with the following exceptions: You may avoid ?nance charges, on purchases during any billing period if: (1) the opening balance on Purchases during any billing period was zero (0); or (2) the total of payments and credits posted during the billing period equals or exceeds the opening balance for that billing period. 
We calculate the Finance Charge on Purchases by applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your Purchase Account (including current transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your Purchases Account each day, add any new Purchases and subtract any payments or credits applied to Purchases that day, unpaid ?nance charges, late charges, overlimit fees and returned item fees. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the �average daily balance� which is shown on your statement as the Finance Charge Balance for Purchases. Finally, we multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate and the number of days in the billing period. 
The daily periodic rate and corresponding Annual Percentage Rate may vary (increase or decrease) quarterly based upon the 
movement in the highest prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on March 15th, June 15th, September 15th, and December 15th of each year (�index date�). If the Wall Street Journal is not published on any of these dates, the index will be the highest prime rate published on the ?rst publication date immediately following the index date. To obtain the Annual Percentage Rate we add 7.9% to the published index. To obtain the daily periodic rate we divide the Annual Percentage Rate by 365. A change in the daily periodic rate and corresponding Annual Percentage Rate resulting from a change in the index on the index dates stated above will be effective as of the billing date indicated on your April, July, October and January monthly billing statements respectively. An increase in the Annual Percentage Rate may result in an increase in the amount of your minimum payment. 
8b. Finance Charge on Cash Advances: A ?nance charge will be imposed on each Cash Advance from the day the Cash Advance is obtained until the date it is paid in full. We calculate the Finance Charge on Cash Advances by adding any Transaction Fee applied to new Cash Advances to the amount determined by applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your Cash Advances Account (including current transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your Cash Advances Account each day, add any new Cash Advances, and subtract any payments or credits applied to Cash Advances that day, unpaid ?nance charges, late charges, over limit fees, transaction fees, and returned item fees. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the �average daily balance� which is shown on your statement as the Finance Charge Balance for Cash Advances. Finally, we multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate of .04904% (corresponding Annual Percentage Rate of 17.90%) and the number of days in the billing period. 
8c. Minimum Finance Charge: There will be a minimum Finance Charge of ?fty cents ($.50) for each billing period in which a ?nance charge is payable on your Purchases Account. 
8d. Cash Advance Transaction Fee: You will pay a transaction fee (?nance charge) each time you obtain a Cash Advance. The transaction fee will be 3% of the amount advanced but not less than $1.00 or more than $30.00. 

9. Returned Item Fee: 	We will charge you a returned item fee of $20.00 whenever your payment is returned to us for insuf?cient funds or any other reason. 

10. Late Charges: You will pay a late charge of $25.00 any time a minimum payment remains unpaid for more than one billing period. 

11. Overlimit Fee: You will pay an overlimit fee of $20.00 if the principal balance of Purchases and Cash Advances exceeds 

your established credit limit on the closing date of your billing period. 
12. Payment: You promise to pay us all the amount borrowed under this Agreement and any other amount which you may owe us pursuant to this Agreement. 
At any time and without penalty, you may repay all or part of what you owe. You must, however, make at least the minimum payment each month. This minimum payment will be the total of: (1) the greater of [a] 1/60th of the outstanding principal Cash Advances and Purchases, or [b] $5.00, or the balance due, whatever is less; plus (2) currently calculated ?nance charges, cash advance transaction fees, other fees and charges incurred during the billing period, and insurance premium charges; plus (3) any minimum payment amount which is past due; plus (4) any amount in excess of your credit limit. 
Paying more than the minimum payment for your account for any billing period will not relieve you of the obligation to pay any further minimum payment for your account. 

13. Payment Allocation: Your payment will be applied in the following order to any of these costs you owe: (1) collection costs, (2) fees and other card charges, (3) late charges, ?nance charges and insurance premiums in manner and order Credit Union elects, (4) unpaid principal balance of accrued Purchases and Cash Advances. 

14. Insurance: Credit life insurance and/or credit disability insurance may be made available to you by the Credit Union. Insurance coverage is not required by us as a condition for the extension of credit. If you should elect and qualify for the same, the coverage will be up to the minimum amount of credit extended to you. If you die, the insurance proceeds will be used to pay off your outstanding debt on the account. If you wish to have this coverage, you will give us a dated and signed written statement that you desire to obtain insurance coverage before we make it available. A certi?cate describing the coverage will be mailed to you 30 days after coverage begins. The premiums for this insurance will be due monthly and will be added to your minimum payment each billing period. 

15. Default: 	You will be in default if you fail to make a minimum payment when due. You will be in default if you break any promise you made under this Agreement, or under any other written agreement made in connection with use of the Card. You will also be in default if you become insolvent, declare bankruptcy or die. When you are in default, the Credit Union may demand immediate payment of the entire amount you owe under this Agreement without giving you advance notice. 

Also, we may prohibit any further transactions on your Account, cancel the Cards, and revoke any privileges attaching to the Cards. You agree to surrender all Cards to us or our designee upon 
demand. If you default, we, at our option, may refuse to pay any of your convenience checks that are presented to us. If we decide to honor such checks, you will owe us the amount of such checks under the terms of this Agreement. 
16. No Notice or Loss of Rights: 	We do not have to notify you if any amount owing under this Agreement is not paid by the day it becomes due. We can do any of the following without notifying you or losing any right against you: 
� accept a check or money order marked �paid in full� or with similar language, as a payment under this Agreement, or 
� give additional time for payment of any amount owing under this Agreement, regardless of the length of any additional time we previously gave, or 
� exercise, give up, fail to exercise or delay exercising any right against any person. 


17. Collection Costs: If you are in default, you agree to pay actual costs of collection. This may include reasonable attorney fees not to exceed 20% of the amount due. 

18. Amendment: We can change the terms of this Agreement, including the ?nance charge, and the annual percentage rate, at any time. Except where limited by applicable law, the new terms will apply both to new purchases and cash advances and to the full outstanding balance of your account as of the day of the change. In accordance with applicable law, we will notify you of any increased charge or change by writing to you at the most recent address shown for you on our records. 

19. Statement, Notices and Change of Address: Any statement for your account or any notice concerning your account or this Agreement we send you will be sent to your current mailing address as shown in our records concerning your account. We can send it by regular mail. If your mailing address changes, you must promptly notify us in writing of the new address. Any notice you send us must be sent to: PCSU-MCU, P.O. Box 31112, Tampa, Florida 33631-3112. 

20. No Assignment or Transfer: You cannot assign or transfer your rights under this Agreement. Any assignment or transfer by you will be ineffective. 

21. VISA Cards: The VISA Card is a part of this Agreement and must be signed immediately after you have received it. Each VISA Card issued for use with your account is and will remain our property and must be returned to us if requested to do so. We or anyone acting for us can keep the VISA Card if it is used after your account has been canceled or after we have requested you to return it to us.

You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases and cash advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each monthly Account Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you exceed your authorized credit limit; the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return or forfeit the Card and close the account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized credit limit. The Bank may approve purchases or cash advances which cause the balance to exceed your credit limit without waiving any of its rights under this Agreement.

INTEREST CHARGES APPLICABLE TO PUERTO RICO, US VIRGIN ISLANDS AND BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS:
The INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on the principal balance only. You will pay a monthly INTEREST CHARGE on the balance of your account for the billing period. This INTEREST CHARGE will be variable and can change for each billing period. The INTEREST CHARGE for purchases, balance transfers from other institutions and convenience checks will be determined by adding the value of the United States Prime Rate, published in The Wall Street Journal (Prime Rate) to a margin. This is equivalent to the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR). To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. The APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers from other institutions will be from 10.99% up to 23.99% with a corresponding Daily Periodic Rate from 0.0301 up to 0.0658%. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE for cash advances will be determined by adding the Prime Rate to a margin (please refer to this section on the table included to obtain the margin and APR applicable to your account). The APR for Cash Advances will be from 18.24% up to 23.99% with a corresponding Daily Periodic Rate from 0.0500% up to 0.0658%. To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. For Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands, the margin applicable to your account will depend on your credit history at the time of approval of your application. For British Virgin Islands the margin applicable to your account will depend on the banking relationship you maintain with the Bank at the time of approval of your application. For each billing period, the INTEREST CHARGE and the APR will be based on the Prime Rate current three business days prior to your account statement closing date. In the event that The Wall Street Journal is not published within any time period, the �LA TIMES� will be used as reference. An increase of the Prime Rate could represent an increase in the APR and in the minimum monthly payment. Any change in your INTEREST CHARGE will apply to the Balance in your account and to new transactions during the billing period. The INTEREST CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the number of days in the billing cycle. The Average Daily Balance is obtained by taking into account the initial balance for each day of the billing period, subtracting the payments and credits, and adding the purchases. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the said total is divided by the number of days included within the billing period

ANNUAL FEE
If applicable, the Annual Fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the Card.  Please refer to the �Annual Fee� section in the table included.

For Balances of $25 and over the Minimum Payment will be 2% of the Outstanding Balance or the Finance Charges + $10 or a fixed amount of $25, whichever is higher.

PAYMENT APPLICATION

Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required payment the excess will be applied to the most onerous debt.

This INTEREST CHARGE will be variable and can change for each billing period. The INTEREST CHARGE for purchases, balance transfers from other institutions and convenience checks will be determined by adding the value of the United States Prime Rate, published in The Wall Street Journal (Prime Rate) to a margin. This is equivalent to the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR). To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. The APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers from other institutions will be from 10.99% up to 23.99% with a corresponding Daily Periodic Rate from 0.0301 up to 0.0658%. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE for cash advances will be determined by adding the Prime Rate to a margin (please refer to this section on the table included to obtain the margin and APR applicable to your account).

For each billing period, the INTEREST CHARGE and the APR will be based on the Prime Rate current three business days prior to your account statement closing date. In the event that The Wall Street Journal is not published within any time period, the �LA TIMES� will be used as reference. An increase of the Prime Rate could represent an increase in the APR and in the minimum monthly payment. Any change in your INTEREST CHARGE will apply to the Balance in your account and to new transactions during the billing period. The INTEREST CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the number of days in the billing cycle. The Average Daily Balance is obtained by taking into account the initial balance for each day of the billing period, subtracting the payments and credits, and adding the purchases. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the said total is divided by the number of days included within the billing period

In your letter, give us the following information:
* Account information: Your name and account number.
* Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
* Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.

You must contact us:
* Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
* At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
* We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
* The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
* While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
* We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
* If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
* If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. 

If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.




Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true:

1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us at custserv@bppr.com  or in writing at:

BANCO POPULAR DE PUERTO RICO
Divisi�n de Productos de Tarjetas
PO BOX 363228 
San Juan, Puerto Rico 00936-3228

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above.  After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

Visa Signature
consumer credit card Agreement

In this Agreement, �Agreement� means this Consumer Credit Card Agreement. �Disclosure� means the Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening 
Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean
each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union 
issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears 
on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement.

1.REVOLVING CREDIT LINE AND USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for Visa Signature account, the Credit Union will establish a revolving credit line on your 
account. Your revolving credit line is the maximum amount we allow you to carry over from billing cycle to billing cycle as a revolving line of credit.  Your credit
union Visa Signature Card has no-preset spending limit.  Absence of a pre-set spending limit does not mean all transactions will be approved.  Transactions will be 
considered on an individual basis and will be evaluated for approval based on factors such as card fraud, account history, revolving balances, payment history, credit 
record, prior cash advances and safety and soundness consideration.  You agree that your revolving credit line is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance 
charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will not allow advances over the 
revolving credit line. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that exceed your revolving credit line, subject to a fee, the Credit Union 
will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled �Statements and Notices�) explaining 
your right to opt in to the Credit Union�s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in to such a program, you agree to the 
terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your 
revolving credit line, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. 

2.USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card 
Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not 
responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide 
card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial 
institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, 
it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not 
use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all 
amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and 
engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, 
money orders, bets, lottery tickets, and casino gaming chips, as applicable. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal.

3.CONVENIENCE CHECKS � If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. 
Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right 
to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor.
You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. 
You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us 
a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be 
applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in 
writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop 
payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop 
payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to 
assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop 
payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. 

4.AUTHORIZATIONS � Some transactions on your account will require prior approval. These prior approvals are called ""authorizations"". If you attempt to make a transaction that exceeds your 
revolving credit line for Purchases, your account will be evaluated based upon length of time your account has been opened and account usage, performance and delinquency patterns with us 
or with your other creditors, and your ability to repay.  If you are authorized to exceed your revolving credit line, you will be required to pay, as part of your minimum monthly payment, 
the amount by which your New balance exceeds your revolving credit line. Each payment you make on the account will restore your revolving credit line by the amount of the payment which is 
applied to principal.  
We may limit the number of authorizations we will give the account during any certain period of time and we may deny an authorization if we suspect that your account is being used without 
your permission. For example, authorization requests may be declined if you have not activated your Card upon receipt, if we believe you may be unable to repay any portion of your balance, 
or if the total amount due has not been posted by the payment due date. We may also, from time to time, request additional information from you, in order to evaluate a transaction request 
for your Account. For security reasons, we cannot explain the details of how the authorization system works. You agree that we will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. 
Transactions at some participating merchants (such as hotels, car rental companies, restaurants and gas stations) may result in authorizations for amounts greater than the actual purchase 
amount, which will have the effect of making less credit available on your account for several days (usually until the date the actual purchase amount is received from the merchant). If the 
authorization is denied we may notify the person who attempted the transaction that it has been refused. 

5.PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize 
to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. 
If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account.

6.PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may 
be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is 
variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure 
accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would 
ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this 
Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of 
this Agreement. 

7.FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that 
billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase 
is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. 
A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is 
later (transaction date).
The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily 
balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. 
This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives 
us the average daily balance of purchases. 
For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning 
outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. 
We then add all of the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. 
Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances.

8.FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � When you use your Visa card at a merchant that settles in currency other than U.S. dollars, the charge will be converted into the U.S. dollar amount. The currency conversion rate used to 
determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars is either a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary 
from the rate Visa itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date.

9.FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying 
this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. MERGEFORMAT 
	a.Annual Fee. If your account is subject to an Annual Fee, the fee will be charged to your account upon the issuance of your card. Each year following, the annual fee will be charged to your account during 
the same month that you were first charged the fee. The fee will be charged each year until your account is closed and paid in full.
	b.Cash Advance Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Cash Advance Fee (finance charge), the fee will be charged to your account when you obtain a cash advance from an ATM, the Credit Union 
or other financial institution. 
	c.Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States 
or in a foreign currency. 
	d.Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement 
Payment Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
	e.Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be added to your account
when a payment is returned to you for any reason.
	f.Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union, a fee may 
be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request.
	g.Rush Fee. If your account is subject to a Rush Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each rush card that you request, providing delivery of the card is also 
available by standard mail service, without paying a fee for delivery.
	h.Collection Costs. You promise to pay, subject to applicable law, all costs of collecting what you owe under this Agreement and all costs including court costs, collection agency fees and reasonable attorney�s 
fees. We may enter into a
contingent or hourly fee arrangement with an attorney or collection agency and you agree that such an Agreement is reasonable. This provision also applies to bankruptcy, appeals or post judgment 
proceedings.

10.PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance 
in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 2.50% of your total new 
balance, or $50.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on 
the statement. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. 

11.PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of 
the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based 
on applicable annual percentage rate. 

12.SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. 
Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment 
under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts 
to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default.
Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement. 

13.DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default 
if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You 
will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe.
When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full 
account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given 
as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe.

14.LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION � You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at 340 N. Milwaukee Ave., Vernon Hills, IL 60061 or telephone (800) 449-7728 seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a 
day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible 
unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.

15.CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT � As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If 
permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions.
Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. 
Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made 
to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized.
The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon 
termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account. 

16.CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS � Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to access your account. Your 
letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user. 
If you cannot return the authorized user's card or access checks and if you request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for a new account.

17.CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION � You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus 
and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. If your account is eligible for emergency cash and/or emergency card replacement services, and you request such services, you agree that we may provide personal information about you and your 
account that is necessary to provide you with the requested service(s).

18.RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS � Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments 
exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6) months.

19.ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS � The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit Union is 
not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.

in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home.

21.JOINT ACCOUNTS � If this is a joint account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay the entire 
amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may terminate the account and the termination will be effective to all of you.

is insufficient credit available, the check will be returned to the 
payee.

LOST OR STOLEN CARD:

You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card if 
you fail to notify us in a timely manner or refuse to cooperate with 
a fraud investigation.

If your credit card is lost or stolen, or if you have reason to believe,

for us to bring the account current by transferring funds from any 
CCCU deposit account on which you are an owner.

The Credit Union may delay enforcing any of its rights under 
this Agreement any number of times without losing the ability to 
exercise its rights later.

legal representatives.

of Florida. You agree that venue for any action brought pursuant to

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS:

KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE

This notice contains important information about your rights

 and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

NOTIFY US IN CASE OF ERRORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR BILL

If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information 
about a transaction on your bill, write to us on a separate sheet at the 
address listed on your statement. Write to us as soon as possible. 
We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the 
first statement on which the error or problem appeared. You can 
telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights.

In your letter, give us the following information

� Your name and account number

� The dollar amount of the suspected error.

� Describe the error and explain why you believe there is an error. 
If you need more information, describe the item in question.

If you have authorized us to pay your credit card payment 
automatically from your savings or checking account, you can 
stop the payment on any amount you think is wrong. To stop the 
payment, your letter must reach us three business days before the 
automatic payment is scheduled to occur.

YOUR RIGHTS AND OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AFTER WE 
RECEIVE YOUR WRITTEN NOTICE

We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have 
corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either correct 
the error or explain why we believe the statement was correct.

After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount 
you question, or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill 
you for the amount you question, including Finance Charges, and 
we can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. You do 
not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, 
but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not 
in question.

If we find that we made a mistake on your statement, you will not 
have to pay any Finance Charges related to any questioned amount. 
If we didn�t make a mistake, you may have to pay Finance Charges, 
and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned 
amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount 
you owe and the date due.

If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report 
you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you 
and you write to us within ten days telling us that you still refuse to 
pay, we must tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We 
must tell anyone we reported you to that the matter has been settled 
between us when it finally is.

SPECIAL RULES FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES

If you have a problem with the quality of property or services that 
you purchased with a credit card, and you tried in good faith to 
correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to 
pay the remaining amount due on the property or services. There are 
two limitations on this right (a) you must have made the purchase in 
your home state or, if not within your home state, within 100 miles of 
your current mailing address, and (b) the purchase price must have 
been more than $50. These limitations do not apply if we own or 
operate the merchant, or if we mailed you the advertisement for the 
property or service.



CREDIT CARD OVERLIMIT ALLOWANCE:

You may enroll in the Credit Card Overlimit Allowance service if 
you want to permit authorizations to take your balance up to 110% 
of your credit limit. Contact us for enrollment form. 

If you have chosen not to have Credit Card Overlimit Allowance, 
authorizations presented that will take you over your credit limit 
will be declined. 

PROMISE TO PAY:

You agree to pay us all amounts owed on your account under this 
Agreement. This includes charges for insurance (you elect), account 
fees, and finance charges as described in this Agreement.

By using or authorizing another agent to use your credit card or credit 
card account, you agree to be responsible for all charges incurred 
and to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

You, as Cardholder, will be liable and subsequently agree to pay 
CCCU for credit purchases and loan advances extended to you or 
any agent using your Card unless both of the following apply:

� The person using your card did not have actual, implied, or 
apparent authority from you for such use.

� You received no direct or indirect benefit.

If this is a joint credit card account, you are jointly and severally 
liable for all credit purchases, and loan advances obtained using 
your card by any authorized user. Consequently, each of you, 
together or individually, is responsible for all amounts owed. This 
applies even if only one of you uses the account.

YOUR RIGHT TO CANCEL:

You may cancel your credit card account at any time. If you opt 
to cancel and have an outstanding balance on your card it will be 
frozen at the current APR until paid in full. Payments must be made 
as required or the account will be subject to late fees. 

You also have the right to cancel permission for an authorized user 
to continue to use your credit card, you must notify us in writing and 
return any card(s) issued (cut in half) to or for the authorized user. 
You will be liable for all purchases, cash advances, and account fees 
created by an authorized agent, until we receive the required written 
notification and card.

If this is a joint account, either owner may request the account be 
closed. We will honor the request without liability to either joint 
cardholder.

PAYMENTS:

On or before each Payment Due Date, you agree to make a payment. 
The Payment Due Date will be the same date each month. The 
minimum payment amount is 3% of your card account balance, (as 
of the last day of the billing cycle) or $10, whichever is greater.

The Credit Union does, however, reserve the right to charge for 
dishonored payment due to insufficient or uncollected funds in 
accordance with the CCCU Fee Schedule.

We can accept late payments, partial payments, payments that are 
marked �payment in full�, or payments with restrictive endorsements, 
without losing any of our rights under this Agreement.

Payment for more than the minimum amount will be accepted as a 
single payment on your CCCU Visa� Secured or Rebuilder Credit 
Card account for that month.

Payments should be mailed and addressed to VISA, P.O. Box 
96099, Charlotte, NC 28296-0099. Please allow sufficient mailing 
time for payment posting.

Payments may also be made through CCCU Call-24 audio system, 
CCCU Web Site (InfoLink), and at any CCCU branch. Payments 
made by these choices will be posted with that day�s effective date 
if received by 4pm local time

.

PRE-AUTHORIZED CARD PAYMENT SERVICE:

You may pre-authorize CCCU to pay your credit card payment from 
your savings or checking account each month in the amounts you 
have elected from the following options:

� The Minimum Payment (3% of the balance on the last day of 
the billing cycle or $10, whichever is greater).

� The total outstanding unpaid balance

� A fixed amount greater than the monthly Minimum Payment.

There are no transfer fees or charges for CCCU pre-authorized 
payment service. 

PAYMENT APPLICATION:

Payment amounts received in excess of Minimum Payment shall be 
applied to card balances bearing the highest rate of interest and then 
to each successive balance bearing the next highest rate of interest, 
until the payment amount is exhausted. 

PERIODIC STATEMENT:

We will send you a monthly statement at least 21 days prior to your 
Payment Due Date (if your account is active) which will indicate 
your credit limit, statement closing date, previous statement balance, 
payments, purchases, cash advances, finance charges, new balance, 
minimum monthly payment and payment due date. In addition, the 
periodic statement shall include a payment warning that specifies; 
the number of months it would take to pay the balance making 
only the minimum balance payment, total interest and principal 
costs associated with paying the balance by making only minimum 
payments, monthly payment amount to pay the balance in 36 months, 
and a toll-free number to obtain information on credit counseling. 
Statements will be deemed correct and accepted by Cardholder(s) 
unless CCCU is notified to the contrary in writing within 60 days 
of statement date.

FINANCE CHARGE INTEREST APR:

The Interest Rate used to calculate Finance Charge is a variable rate 
subject to change with the beginning of your August statement cycle 
each year and is indexed to the Wall Street Prime as published in the 
Wall Street Journal for June 30th of each year. A margin rate shall be 
added to the Prime rate (see Table 1).

FINANCE CHARGE CALCULATION:

Cash Advances / Balance Transfers:

The finance charge on cash advance, (including automated teller 
machine (ATM) and convenience check transactions), and balance 
transfers are calculated according to the following method:

A finance charge will be charged on Cash Advances and Balance 
Transfers from the date of the transaction or from the first day of 
the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to the account 
(whichever is later). If not paid in full during the same billing cycle 
as made, the finance charge will accrue on the unpaid balance until 
the billing cycle Closing Date prior to the date the entire New 
Balance is paid in full.

If the New Balance indicated on your statement is paid in full by the 
Payment Due Date, no finance charge will be imposed during the 
current billing cycle for Cash Advances or Balance Transfers made 
during the previous billing cycles.

The Finance Charge, for a billing cycle, is computed by multiplying 
the Monthly Periodic Rate times the average daily Cash Advances 
or Balance Transfers balance. The average daily outstanding balance 
is calculated by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the 
billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. The daily balance 
is determined by adding new Cash Advances or Balance Transfers 
and subtracting payments or credits to the previous day�s balance. 
Unpaid finance charges are excluded in determining the daily 
balance.

PURCHASES:

The finance charge on Purchases is calculated according to the 
following method:

A finance charge will be imposed on Purchases that you obtain 
through the use of your Card, only if you elect not to pay the entire 
New Balance by the Payment Due Date shown on your monthly 
statement. The finance charge will be calculated on the unpaid 
balance of previous Purchases from the statement closing date and 
on Purchases made during the current billing cycle from the date of 
posting to the account. The finance charge will continue to accrue 
until the closing date of the billing cycle preceding the date on 
which the entire New Balance is paid in full.

The Finance Charge, for a billing cycle, is computed by multiplying 
the Monthly Periodic Rate times the average daily Purchases 
balance. The average daily outstanding balance is calculated by 
dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by 
the number of days in the cycle. The daily balance is determined 
by adding new Purchases and subtracting payments and credits to 
the previous day�s balance. Unpaid finance charges are excluded in 
determining the daily balance.

DEFAULT:

You will be in default on this Agreement if one or more of the 
following occur:

� You fail to make a Minimum Payment by the scheduled 
Payment Due Date.

� You fail to abide by the terms of this Agreement or any other 
agreement you may have with CCCU.

� Your financial or credit status has changed so that your credit 
worthiness has been negatively impacted.

In addition, you will be considered in default of this Agreement if: 

� Cardholder dies

� Require past due payment(s) and fees to be paid immediately.

� Take the past due payment(s) and fees from any deposit 
account in your name.

� Require you to immediately pay all amounts you owe under 
this Agreement.

� Take the amount owed under this Agreement from any deposit 
account in your name.

You understand that any remedy applicable under this agreement is 
extended equally to co-applicant or Guarantor.

If you are in default, you agree to pay all our costs, including 
attorney�s fees, which we incur in any collection efforts or litigation 
at the trial, bankruptcy or appellate level to enforce this Agreement 
and collect the amount owed.

SKIP PAYMENT OPTION:

From time to time, the Credit Union, at its option and terms, may 
announce an optional feature, which will allow you to skip one or 
more payments. You understand that periodic finance charges will 
continue to accrue on your unpaid balance at the applicable Monthly 
Periodic Rate. At the end of the period, the payment terms of this 
Agreement will be reinstated automatically without notice.

TERMS/CHANGE IN TERMS:

You agree that we, at our sole discretion, may change all terms, 
including annual percentage rates (APRs), line of credit amount, 
features and fees, any time in accordance with our agreement and 
applicable law. We may make changes based on information in your 
credit report, market conditions, business strategies, or for any other 
reason we may choose. We will provide advanced written notice of 
a change in terms, as required by law. The address of record, at the 
time of a change, will be used for such notice.

Any increase or decrease to an APR based on a change in terms, will 
only apply to new cash advances (including ATM and convenience 
check transactions), balance transfers, and purchases. Existing 
balance shall remain at the existing APR until paid in full.

If we decide to make changes you will receive advance notice, as 
required by law, and a right to opt out. If you choose to opt out, 
we will close your card account. You will then pay the remaining 
balance at the rate in effect when closed. Of course, this paragraph 
does not apply to changes required by law, our regulators, or our 
network providers.

REVOCATION:

You agree that your CCCU Visa� Secured or Rebuilder Credit Card 
is the property of CCCU, not transferable, and must be surrendered 
upon demand. We can repossess the card, and revoke all privileges 
at any time and without notice including, but not limited to, the 
following conditions:

� A negative impact to your creditworthiness.

� Your CCCU loan account/s is delinquent.

� Your failure to maintain the minimum required balance on 
your Credit Union Share Account.

� Your failure to satisfy or adhere to the terms and conditions of 
this Agreement.

� You make false or misleading statements in any credit 
application or update of credit information.

� If something happens which the Credit Union believes may 
reduce your ability to repay what you owe.

ANNUAL FEE:

The annual fee for VISA Secured is $50 and is charged on the 

12-month anniversary of the opening month.

The annual fee for VISA Credit Rebuilder is $50 and is charged 
when the account is opened and on the 12-month anniversary.

APPLICATION PROCESSING FEE:

Credit Rebuilder cardholders will incur a processing fee of $50 for 
the following actions:

� Opening of the card account.

� Requesting a credit line increase.

� Requesting a transfer to another credit card product.

LATE FEE:

A late fee of $32 will be charged when a payment is not received

on your monthly periodic statement.

CREDIT CARD OVERLIMIT ALLOWANCE FEE:

A fee of $19 will be charged, if you have opted to permit 
authorizations to take your balance up to 110% of your credit limit 
and authorizations have caused your account balance to exceed $20 
over your credit limit. The Credit Card Overlimit Allowance Fee 
will be charged with each new extension of credit that is over your 
credit limit.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS:

Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will 
be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate 
between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for 
processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from 
a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the 
applicable central processing date, which may vary from the rate 
Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for 
the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on 
the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been 
used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date.

FOREIGN TRANSACTION FEE:

A fee of 3% of the amount of the transaction, calculated in U.S. 
dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including 
purchases, cash advances, and credits to your account. A foreign 
transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant 
completes on your card outside of the U.S., Puerto Rico or the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. The fee amount will appear on your statement 
directly below the transaction details.

RETURNED PAYMENT FEE:

A Returned Payment Fee of $10 will be charged if the drawee

DISCLOSURE AND AGREEMENT OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS GOVERNING THE USE OF YOUR CARD

In this agreement, the words �you�, �your�, and/or ""Cardholder(s)"" refers to the person whose name is embossed in the face of the Visa� Platinum, 
Visa Platinum Cash, Visa Platinum Rewards and Visa MyGreenCFE Platinum Rewards credit card (""Card"" or �credit card�) enclosed herewith, 
and each Cardholder, in the event more than one Card is enclosed bearing the same account number (�Account�).  The words �CFE� and/or �Issuer� 
refer to Central Florida Educators� Federal Credit Union.  This Agreement replaces all prior Agreements between Cardholder and CFE.

Before using your Card, please review this Agreement carefully.  By signing or using any Card that is enclosed with this document or that may be 
issued to you and/or to any Cardholder you authorize, you agree that you understand and will comply with all of the terms and conditions pertaining 
to the use of such card established by CFE�s Board of Directors and disclosed to you in this Agreement. CFE reserves the right to amend this 
Agreement at any time and for any reason.  CFE shall send you written notice thereof, mailed to you at your last known address.  Any changes in 
these terms, including, without limitation, changes in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) and the Periodic Rate, shall be effective with respect to 
any balances then outstanding to the extent allowable by law as well as to future Credit Purchases and Cash Advances.  For example, CFE may 
change the terms based on information in your credit report; APRs may change to higher APRs, fixed APRs may change to variable APRs, or variable 
APRs may change to fixed APRs. Any changes will be in accordance with your account agreement.

In the event you do not wish to comply with these terms and conditions for any reason, you understand that you may terminate this agreement and 
return the credit card to CFE. Cardholder acknowledges receiving from Issuer the initial disclosures required by Regulation Z of the Truth-In-Lending 
Act (""Initial Disclosures"") and agrees that the terms contained in the initial Disclosures apply to Cardholder and Cardholder's use of the Card.

CFE will establish a line of credit for you and notify you of your credit limit. The credit limit approved shall be determined by the credit union, and 
this credit limit will be drawn upon and replenished as you access the available funds by using an issued credit card, a convenience check, or by 
other means. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount you will have outstanding on your account, at any time, including purchases, 
cash advances, Finance Charges, plus other fees described in this or subsequent disclosures.  If you are over your credit limit, you must pay the 
amount you are over before payments will begin to restore your credit limit.  You may request an increase in your credit limit by a method acceptable 
to the Issuer.  The Issuer has the right to reduce your credit limit, decline any transaction including but not limited to cash advances, and/or 
terminate your Account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law.
 
Using Your Credit Card Account: You may use your card to make purchases from entities that accept credit cards.  You may be required to provide 
card number security information to purchase goods or services via the Internet or telephone before your transaction is completed.  You may use 
your Card to obtain cash advances from CFE, other participating financial institutions, or an automated teller machine (ATM) authorized for such 
transactions. Use of your Card to obtain cash advance(s) from an ATM requires use of the Personal Identification Number (PIN) that is issued to you 
for use with this Card. Note that some ATMs do not allow cash advances or accept Visa. You agree not to use your Card to conduct any illegal 
transaction per applicable federal, state, or local law, including, but not limited to, using the card to initiate any type of gambling or wagering where 
such practices are in violation of federal, state, or local law. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions you initiate 
by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.

Issuer shall not be responsible for refusal by any entity to honor the Card or any related Card.  Any refund, adjustment or credit allowed shall not be 
by cash but rather by a credit advice to Issuer which shall be shown as a credit on Cardholder's account statement with Issuer.

Security Precautions: CFE Federal Credit Union advises all check card and credit cardholders to please exercise discretion when using an 
Automated Teller Machine (ATM). There are risks of using a PIN at an ATM terminal that has been modified, has a suspicious device attached, may 
not be genuine, or is otherwise operating in a suspicious manner. Therefore, please tell us if you know of any problem with a facility. For instance, 
let us know if a light is not working or there is any damage to a facility. Report any suspicious activity or crimes to both the operator of the facility 
and the local law enforcement officials immediately. We want the ATM and night deposit facility to be safe and convenient for you. 

Additional Benefits/Card Enhancements: CFE may, from time to time, offer additional services or benefits to your Account, such as travel 
insurance, rewards points which may be redeemed for travel, gift certificates or merchandise, cash rebates, or other benefits.  Such benefits shall be 
provided at no additional cost to you.  CFE reserves the right to limit the number of points or the amount of cash rebates or other benefits at any 
time without notice. You understand and agree that CFE is under no obligation to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.

Your Responsibility: You agree that you are liable for and will pay CFE all charges (purchases, cash advances) to your account made by you or 
anyone else who is authorized to use your credit card Account (including all Cards bearing the same Visa account number).  You shall be liable and 
agree to pay Issuer for Credit Purchases made by, or for Cash Advances extended to, Cardholder or anyone else using such Card unless the use of 
such Card is by a person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, implied or apparent authority for such use, and (b) from which 
Cardholder receives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally liable and agrees to pay for all Credit Purchases and Loans 
obtained through the use of any other Card bearing Cardholder�s account number that has been issued to another person by reason of such person 
by being a member of Cardholder�s family, or otherwise issued upon Cardholder�s request (all such Cards bearing the same Visa account number 
hereinafter collectively called �Related Cards�). In addition, you agree to pay all Finance Charges and other charges added to your Account under 
the terms of this Disclosure and Agreement and any other applicable Agreement you have made with CFE.  You undertake to safeguard the Card 
against damage, loss, theft or misuse and to maintain it at all times in a safe place. You will be responsible for any loss, claim or damage resulting 
from your failure to do so.

Young members: The Credit Card Act restricts CFE�s ability to provide young members with credit cards who are under the age of 21. In order to 
issue credit cards to such members, the application will have to: 1) include the signature of a consignor, guarantor, or joint applicant who has 
attained the age of 21 and has the means to repay the debts incurred; or 2) include financial information indicating that the underage member has 
the ability to repay the debts incurred.  Future credit line increases will follow the above requirements.

Returns and Adjustments: All credit purchases and cash advances are affected at the option of the merchant and/or cash advancing financial 
institution. Any refund, adjustment or credit allowed by any entity will be made by a credit advice to Issuer which will be applied as a credit on your 
account statement.  If your credits and payments exceed what you owe on your Account, the amount will be applied against future purchases and/or 
cash advances.  If your credit balance exceeds $1, you may request a refund by writing to us at:  CFE Federal Credit Union, Attn: Card Services, PO 
Box 958471, Lake Mary, Florida  32795-8471, Phone: 407-896-9411, outside Orlando 1-800-771-9411, option 3.

Credit Limit: By using the card, you acknowledge that you applied for a credit card to use from time to time and which may be replenished by 
payment on amounts previously drawn.  The credit limit will be determined by the Issuer, and will be drawn upon as you utilize the Account.  You 
agree not to use your Card or permit the use of your Account to obtain credit purchases or loans which will increase your credit card indebtedness to 
us to an amount in excess of the established limit. 

Statements and Notices: CFE will send you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union, at monthly intervals determined by us, a 
statement reflecting all Account activity for the prior period (�cycle�), including purchases, cash advances, fees, and payments.  Additional notices 
and information may be sent to you at any time.  Such statements, notices, and information will be sent to the most recent mailing address you have 
provided to the Credit Union.  Notice sent to any one authorized user on the Account will constitute notice sent to all authorized users.  Unless you 
notify us in writing within 60 days of the mailing of each statement, the statement will be deemed correct and accepted by you and all authorized 
users of the Account.  

Payment: You agree to pay at least the minimum required payment amount shown on your statement by the date shown on the statement or no 
later than twenty-five (25) days from the statement closing date, whichever is later.  You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum 
payment, or repay the Total New Balance in full at your option without penalty. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make 
at least the minimum payment each month your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The required MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 
will be the greater of:  a) $20 or b) 3% of the portion of the outstanding balance which does not exceed your credit limit, plus the entire portion of 
the outstanding balance in excess of your credit limit, plus any amount past due.  If the outstanding balance of your account is $20 or less, it will be 
payable in full. CFE may accept checks marked ""Payment in Full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of our rights to collect the full 
balance of your account. Except where prohibited by law, satisfaction of your account balance for less than the New Balance requires written 
agreement signed by one of our authorized employees.

Payment Allocation: Payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and 
any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order from the highest APR based on the applicable APR in accordance with law. Any 
payments less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be applied at our discretion. You may no longer direct us how to apply your payment 
among your account types or on balances within your account types.

Default: You will be in default under any of the following circumstances:  1) if you fail to make any minimum payment or other payment required by 
the Issuer on or before the date it is due or if you attempt to in any way avoid payment of your obligations; 2) if you violate any portion of your 
responsibility or promise you made under this agreement; 3) if you file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, meaning you are unable to pay your 
obligations when they are due or if attachment or garnishment proceedings are instituted against you; 4) if you made any false or misleading 
statements in any credit application; 5) if you provided false identification or records in connection with any credit application or credit update; 6) in 
the event of your death; 7) if you incur charges for Purchases and Cash Advances which exceed the maximum authorized credit limit; and/or 8) if the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, believes your ability to repay what you owe may be substantially reduced due to an event either within or beyond your 
control. Failure by Issuer to assert any rights hereunder shall not waive such rights. 

When you are in default, the Issuer may demand immediate payment of your Account balance in full without giving you prior notice.  If immediate 
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying Finance Charges at the annual percentage rate established for this account by the Issuer, until 
the entire balance has been paid.  Any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe the Issuer.  

Security Interest: You agree that this account is secured by all share and deposit accounts that you have or may have with CFE and that 
collateral pledged for other loans you have with this credit union will also secure your obligation under this agreement. However, unless you 
expressly agree otherwise, your IRA�s, household goods and primary dwelling will not secure your obligations under this agreement even if the 
Issuer has or later acquires a security interest in the household goods or a mortgage on the dwelling. This security interest shall continue as 
long as you have your credit card account even if there is no outstanding balance on your account from time to time. You agree that if you do not 
make your credit card account payments on time, or if the balance on your Account exceeds your credit limit, CFE may, without notice to you, take 
funds from one or more of your share accounts to apply to the payment of this Account, and interests and costs, if delinquent and/or over the 
credit limit.

Interest: Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the Finance Charge calculation method referred to in the 
Disclosure box. The rate of interest will be established by Issuer from time to time and will not exceed the maximum rate of 17.75% APR.  The current 
interest rate per annum is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) set forth in the Disclosure box below.

Variable Rate Information: Your APR will vary. The rate for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers is determined by Prime Rate (Wall 
Street Journal Index). The Wall Street Journal Index is published in the consumer rates table of the Wall Street Journal on the 15th of each month (or 
the next business day if not published on the 15th) effective with your billing statement the following month.

Termination of this Agreement: CFE may terminate this agreement under the following conditions: a) upon adverse re-evaluation of your credit 
worthiness; b) if you fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement; and/or c) at your option or our option, if we have good cause.  If your credit card 
Account is to be terminated by the Issuer, you will receive written notice of such termination as applicable by law; however, you understand and 
acknowledge that such termination will not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance, Finance Charge, and fees.  The Card(s) issued to 
you for this Account remain the property of the Issuer.   

Card Ownership and Surrender Rules: Each Card is the property of CFE is not transferable and must be surrendered upon demand. The card can 
be cancelled as well as repossessed by CFE or its designee, and the privileges revoked, at any time without prior notice.  If the card is cancelled or 
surrender is demanded by Issuer, or if you default in any payment due, or if you are bankrupt or insolvent, or any attachment or garnishment 
proceedings are initiated against you or your property, or in the event of your death, CFE may elect to declare all amounts then owed to be 
immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. 

Reapplication: A reapplication by you and approval by the Issuer may be required if: a) the credit limit is increased; or b) the terms of payment are 
extended beyond the terms of the original agreement.

Delinquent loans: You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if your loans with us become delinquent or past due, your credit card Account 
shall be revoked, unless we determine that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency.  Under such circumstances we reserve the 
right to approve your continued use of the credit card.

Enforcing obligations: You agree to pay all costs incurred by CFE in collecting your debt or in enforcing this agreement, including reasonable 
attorney's fees and also those costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post-judgment proceedings, except to the 
extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law.  Should the Issuer employ or engage the services of any entity to enforce any of your 
obligations relating to this agreement, or to protect its interests in any manner arising under this agreement, you agree to pay to CFE all reasonable 
costs or expenses incurred as a result. 

Communications: You agree that we, our agents or service companies may monitor and/or record any telephone communications or electronic 
communications with you.  

Credit Review and Release of Information: CFE reserves the right to reinvestigate and reevaluate any information you provided on your credit 
application at anytime. In the course of doing so, we may ask you for additional information, request credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify 
your current credit standing. Effective February 1, 2011, due to federal regulations CFE is required to review your account not less 
frequently than once every six months to reassess your credit worthiness and adjust your APR accordingly, if necessary. You agree that 
we may release information to others, such as credit bureaus, regarding the status and history of your account. However, we are not obligated to 
release any such information to anyone unless required by law to do so.

Laws of the State: Except to the extent that Federal law is applicable, the validity, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all matters 
arising out
of the issuance and use of the Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.  You understand and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of 
the State of Florida and that the exclusive venue for any action or dispute shall be in the courts of Orange County, Florida.

Final Agreement / No Waiver: This Disclosure and Agreement is the definitive agreement between you and the Issuer and may not be 
contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.  The Issuer can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

Visa Rules: You agree that your Account shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations of Visa, as applicable, as well as all applicable laws. 
If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and regulations of Visa, the rules and regulations of Visa shall 
control.

Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the 
consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge 
of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Cash advance fees are Finance Charges. Foreign transaction fees are not Finance 
Charges.          
              
Balance Computation Method: Average daily balance method (including current transactions). We figure the interest charge on your account by 
applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your account. To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your 
account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other Finance Charges and] any payments or 
credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the 
billing cycle. This gives us the �average daily balance.�

Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Methods: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a Finance Charge for 
that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle�s 
billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a Finance Charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your 
account. To avoid an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the 
Payment Due Date of that statement. A Finance Charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first 
day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 

The Finance Charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the Finance Charge is computed by applying the 
monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding 
balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. 
Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This 
gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

Method of Computing Cash Advances: The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the 
AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number 
of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances any new Cash 
Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later and subtracting any payments as received 
and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charge.

Balance Transfers: Balance transfers must be transferred from any financial institution other than CFE. Balance transfers and cash advances may 
not be used to pay any CFE accounts. Balance transfers are treated as and considered cash advances on your account. Amounts transferred are 
subject to your available credit limit. We are not required to honor a balance transfer request that will cause you to exceed your available credit limit. 
We will not be responsible for late payment or non-payment to other card issuers. We are not responsible for fees that may be charged for cash 
advances performed at other financial institutions and ATMs owners. There is no grace period for balance transfers.
It may take up to three (3) weeks for other financials to post the balance transfer transaction. You should continue to make all required payments 
until you confirm that the balance transfer was posted to the other financial institution. We will not close your other accounts even if you transfer the 
entire balance. If you wish to close another account, you should contact the issuer directly. 

Balance transfers and cash advances do not qualify to earn bonus points on Visa Platinum Cash, Visa Platinum Rewards and Visa MyGreenCFE 
Platinum Rewards accounts.

Other Fees May Apply to the Account: Additional charges, plus applicable taxes, may also be assessed on the account.  Such fees are added to 
the balance of the Account and will be notated on your statement.  Fees will not be included in any Finance Charge calculation. Use of the card 
constitutes your understanding of an agreement to the following Fee Schedule:

Late Payment Warning: If we do not receive your minimum payment by the date listed on your statement you may have to pay a late 
payment fee of $15 on balances less than $500 and $25* for balances over $499.  Your APR(s) may be increased up to the Penalty APR of 
17.75%.  *The late payment fee for balances over $499 will be based on the greater amount of $20 or 3% of the outstanding balance not to 
exceed $25.
	
Penalty APR: Each time your account becomes 60 days past due, the Penalty APR will apply to all account balances. Any 
Promotional or Introductory APR will end and the Penalty APR will begin on the first day of the billing period. After you have 
made all the required payments on time for six consecutive billing periods, the Annual Percentage Rate will be reduced to the 
regular account APR beginning the first day of your next billing period. The change to your Penalty APR applies to all existing 
and future balances on your account.

Returned Check or Rejected Payment: If you pay us electronically or by check and your financial institution does not honor 
the payment or check, a fee of $25 will apply.

Over-the-credit-limit: If at any time your account balance is over your credit limit a fee will not be charged. 

Special Services: CFE reserves the right to charge a fee for Special Services that you request, if such charges are not prohibited 
by law or regulation. No Finance Charge will be assessed on such additional charges.  For example, a $5 fee applies for each 
copy of a document that you request (except when the request is made in connection with the investigation of a billing error 
made by the Issuer).  You may be charged $5 if you order a replacement card. The fee for other Special Services, if applicable, 
will be disclosed to you prior to processing the request. Additionally, there will be a $20 per hour or $5 minimum research fee. 
No charge will be made in connection with any good faith assertion of a billing error on the account.

Liability for Unauthorized Use: If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of your credit card or related 
cards, you should write to us immediately at: PSCU Financial Services, Credit Card Security Department, PO Box 31281, Tampa, FL 33631-3281 or call 
us at (800) 449-7728. You may also contact us on the Web: www.pscufs.com. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you 
notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.

Unauthorized Use � Visa: You may not be liable for the unauthorized use of your Visa credit card unless we reasonably determine, based on 
substantial evidence, that you were grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handling of the account or the Card, in which case we may increase the limit 
of your liability. If you believe that your card has been lost, stolen, or an unauthorized use has occurred, notify PSCU Financial Services - Credit Card 
Security Department immediately at (800) 449-7728.  

Foreign Transactions and Currency Conversion: For Visa Cards, purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign 
currencies will be billed to you in U.S. Dollars. The conversion rate to dollars will be determined in accordance with the operating 
regulations established by Visa U.S.A. Currently the currency conversion rate used to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars 
is either (i) the wholesale market rate or (ii) the government-mandated rate, whichever is applicable, in effect one day prior to the 
processing date, increased one-percent. The currency conversion rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that 
would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. The 1% International Service Assessment fee 
applies to all international transactions regardless of whether there is actually a currency conversion. You agree to pay the converted 
amount in U.S. dollars, plus any charge for conversion or processing that may be imposed by the Issuer, plus any charge that may be 
imposed for an international transaction.

Protected Balances Due to Rate Increases: Protected balances are the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an 
increased annual percentage rate cannot be applied after the rate for that category of transactions has been increased.

Annual Fee: No annual fee applies to this credit card.

Illegal Use and Internet Gambling: You agree that all transactions that you initiate by use of your card are legal in the jurisdiction where you live 
and/or where the transaction occurred. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located, including the United States. Your 
card may only be used for legal transactions. Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not mean that internet gambling 
transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which you may be located. You agree to repay according to the terms of this Agreement all transactions 
you initiate by use of your card, whether deemed legal or illegal.

USA Patriot Act: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial 
institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: When you open an 
account at CFE, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see 
your driver�s license or other identifying documents.

Right To Reject Change In Terms: A member may reject a significant change in terms by calling (407) 896-9411 or (800) 771-9411, option 3 or by 
mailing us at: CFE Federal Credit Union, Attn: Card Services, PO Box 958471, Lake Mary, FL 32795-8471, but in doing so you will forego any credit 
availability for the account and the account will be terminated or suspended. The balance on the account is the balance at the end of the day on which 
credit availability is terminated or suspended. CFE will establish an amortization period required by law for the balance on the account beginning no 
earlier than the date on which CFE was notified of the rejection. The right to reject a change in terms does not apply if CFE has not received a 
member�s required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for that payment.

ACCOUNT
Taking into consideration the credit granted by Banco Popular of Puerto Rico (Bank) under this account, you bind yourself to pay to the Bank the total price of all purchases and cash advances (includes balance transfers from other institutions and convenience checks) made on this account, as well as the INTEREST CHARGES agreed upon under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Under this new credit plan, the Bank will issue two types of cards per individual, one revolving credit card (�Credit Card�) and one charge card (�Charge Card�). These cards may be used to purchase merchandise and services in those establishments where the Cards are accepted, and to obtain cash advances from the Bank or any other bank that accepts the Cards, subject to the limits established from time to time by the Bank. Clients can choose within the product combinations offered by the Bank from time to time.

CREDIT LIMIT
You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases and cash advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each monthly Account Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you exceed your authorized credit limit; the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return or forfeit the Card and close the account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized credit limit and the total of the Charge Balance owed (please refer to the next section). The Bank may approve purchases or cash advances which cause the balance to exceed your credit limit without waiving any of its rights under this Agreement.

ACCOUNT FUNCTIONALITY
CREDIT CARD: �Credit Balances� refers to balances from purchase transactions made with the Credit Card and all cash advances, balance transfers from other institutions and convenience checks transactions made with the Credit Card or Charge Card, and any Charge Balance that have not been paid in full by its due date. Credit Balances are subject to the corresponding INTEREST CHARGES.

CHARGE CARD: �Charge Balances� refers to balances from purchase transactions made with the Charge Card. This balance is not subject to INTEREST CHARGES if the balance due from such transactions is paid in full by the payment due date of the billing period. In absence of the corresponding payment of the Charge Balance, the unpaid balances will be transferred to the Purchases Section of the Credit Card and will be subject to the corresponding INTEREST CHARGES applying the interest rate corresponding to the credit balance of your account. In addition, the corresponding Late Payment Fee will apply, as described in the table included.  The Charge Card may be used for balance transfers, cash advances and convenience check transactions.  The amount owed as result of such transactions will be subject to INTEREST CHARGES from the transaction date, applying the interest rate corresponding to the transaction type.  Please refer to the section �Interest Rates and Interest Charges� on the table included.

INTEREST CHARGES APPLICABLE TO PUERTO RICO, US VIRGIN ISLANDS AND BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS:
The INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on the principal balance only. You will pay a monthly INTEREST CHARGE on the credit balance of your account for the billing period. This INTEREST CHARGE will be variable and can change for each billing period. The INTEREST CHARGE for Credit Balances will be determined by adding the value of the United States Prime Rate, published in The Wall Street Journal (Prime Rate) effective at the time of the approval to a margin. This is equivalent to the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR). To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. The APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers from other institutions will be from 10.99% up to 23.99% with a corresponding Daily Periodic Rate from 0.0301% up to 0.0658%. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE for cash advances will be determined by adding the Prime Rate to a margin (please refer to this section on the table included to obtain the margin and APR applicable to your account). The APR for Cash Advances will be from 18.24% up to 23.99% with a corresponding Daily Periodic Rate from 0.0500% up to 0.0658%.  To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. Please refer to the �Specific Information on your APRs� section on the table included to obtain the margins and APRs applicable to your account. For Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands, the margin applicable to your account will depend on your credit history at the time of approval of your application.  For British Virgin Islands the margin applicable to your account will depend on the banking relationship you maintain with the Bank at the time of approval of your application. For each billing period, the INTEREST CHARGE and the Credit Balance APR will be based on the Prime Rate current three business days prior to your account statement closing date. In the event that The Wall Street Journal is not published within any time period, the �LA TIMES� will be used as reference. An increase of the Prime Rate could represent an increase in the APR and in the minimum monthly payment. Any change in your INTEREST CHARGE will apply to the Balance in your account and to new transactions during the billing period.� The INTEREST CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the number of days in the billing cycle. The Average Daily Balance is obtained by taking into account the initial balance for each day of the billing period, subtracting the payments and credits, and adding the purchases. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the said total is divided by the number of days included within the billing period. 

ANNUAL FEE
If applicable, the Annual Fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the Card.  Please refer to the �Annual Fee� section in the table included.

MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 
The monthly minimum payment will be determined by adding the minimum payment of the Credit Balance to the total of the Charge Balance owed. The minimum monthly payment for the Credit Balance will be determined based on the Outstanding Balance. For Balances from $0.01 to $24.99 the Minimum Payment will be the Outstanding Balance.  For Balances of $25 and over the Minimum Payment will be 2% of the Outstanding Balance or the Finance Charges + $10; or a fixed amount of $25, whichever is higher.  Then the minimum monthly payment for the Credit Balance will be added to the Charge Balance owed, if any, the total is the minimum monthly payment of the account.  In addition, the minimum monthly payment shall include the total amount in excess of your authorized credit limit.

PAYMENT APPLICATION
If you pay the required minimum payment of the monthly Account Statement, said payment shall be applied in the following way: first to INTEREST CHARGES and the remaining amount shall be applied first to the Charge Balance, then to the Credit Balance with the lowest APR, and then to the debt with the higher APR in ascending order. Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required payment, the excess will be applied to the most onerous debt.  Electronic, telephone and mailed payments are credited on the same day if they are received at or by 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday (excluding holidays).  Mailed payments shall be received at the address indicated on your Account Statement, made with a check drawn against the Bank, and accompanied with the payment stub. It will be also processed the same date if the payment is made through a Banco Popular branch in Puerto Rico or Virgin Islands during business hours in cash, or by check drawn against the Bank. Credit of other payments that do not meet these requirements may be delayed five business days during which interests will not accrue.

MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENT
The Bank shall mail to you a monthly Account Statement at the end of each billing period. In each Account Statement, the following entries will be shown, as applicable: new balance, minimum payment due, payment due date, credit limit, available credit, days in billing cycle, Late Payment Warning, Minimum Payment Warning, previous balance, payments, interest charged, fees charged, other credits, debits, purchases, balance transfers from other institutions, convenience checks and cash advances made within said period, year to date totals for fees and interest charged, interest charge calculation by balance type and the Annual Percentage Rate, You must notify the Bank, in writing, of any error in the Account Statement, within sixty (60) days, following the date on which the statement was mailed.

FEES
Currency Conversion Fee- Transactions made in foreign currency will be billed to you in U.S. dollars.  The currency conversion fees for international transactions into a U.S. dollar amount will be performed by either American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc., Visa International and or MasterCard International (collectively, the �Associations �or individually, the �Association�), depending upon your Card, using: a) A rate selected by the applicable Association from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date. The rate may vary from the rate received by the applicable Association, itself, or b) The government mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date.

The amount requested for the Installment Plan will be subject to your credit line availability. This offer is only available for repayment terms of twelve (12), twenty-four (24), thirty-six (36), forty-eight (48) months or sixty (60 months).

CASHBACK REWARDS PROGRAM
If you chose the cashback rewards program Return, it accumulates in cash 1% of all net purchases made with your credit card (the ""Reward""). In your monthly statement you will receive an estimate of the Reward accumulated. The redemption of money will be automatic and will occur once a year, in January. You will not be able to redeem your Reward before this. The Bank will send you a check for the balance of your Reward to the address where you receive your monthly statements. You will not accumulate a Reward for balance transfers, convenience checks, cash advances, payments thru TelePago Popular or Internet Banking, the purchase of casino chips or other methods of gambling, or any other transaction the Bank determines at its discretion constitutes or is equivalent to a cash advance. If you return merchandise the Reward for that merchandise will be deducted. The percent of the deduction will be calculated based on the earning structure at the moment the merchandise was returned. If the amount of your Reward is less than $10.00 you will not receive a check but it will accumulate for the next year. If your account has a derogative condition the Bank will be able to retain your Reward until the condition ends or cancel the Reward completely, at the Bank's discretion. When calculating the Reward, the Bank will use the total dollar amount of each transaction eliminating the cents. The Bank's determination of the Reward is final. To receive the Reward your account must be kept open until the date of the Reward payment. The cash back rewards program is subject to changes or cancellation at any moment at the Bank's discretion.  

NONCOMPLIANCE
You will be in default if you do not pay an installment on time or file for bankruptcy. In the event of noncompliance, the Bank can demand immediate payment of the total outstanding balance.  If the Bank has to refer collection of the balance to an attorney, you may have to pay legal and attorney�s fees, plus court costs and any other fees allowed by law.

ACCOUNT
Taking into consideration the credit granted by Banco Popular of Puerto Rico (Bank) under this account, you bind yourself to pay to the Bank the total price of all purchases and cash advances (includes balance transfers from other institutions and convenience checks) made on this account, as well as the INTEREST CHARGES agreed upon under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The card may be used to purchase merchandise and services in those establishments where the Card is accepted, and to obtain cash advances from the Bank or any other bank that accepts the Cards, subject to the limits established from time to time by the Bank.

CREDIT LIMIT
You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases and cash advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each monthly Account Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you exceed your authorized credit limit; the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return or forfeit the Card and close the account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized credit limit. The Bank may approve purchases or cash advances which cause the balance to exceed your credit limit without waiving any of its rights under this Agreement.

INTEREST CHARGES APPLICABLE TO PUERTO RICO, US VIRGIN ISLANDS AND BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS:
The INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on the principal balance only. You will pay a monthly INTEREST CHARGE on the balance of your account for the billing period. This INTEREST CHARGE will be variable and can change for each billing period. The INTEREST CHARGE for purchases, balance transfers from other institutions and convenience checks will be determined by adding the value of the United States Prime Rate, published in The Wall Street Journal (Prime Rate) to a margin. This is equivalent to the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR). To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. The APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers from other institutions will be from 10.99% up to 23.99% with a corresponding Daily Periodic Rate from 0.0301% up to 0.0658%. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE for cash advances will be determined by adding the Prime Rate to a margin (please refer to this section on the table included to obtain the margin and APR applicable to your account). The APR for Cash Advances will be from 18.24% up to 23.99% with a corresponding Daily Periodic Rate from 0.0500% up to 0.0658%.   To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. For Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands, the margin applicable to your account will depend on your credit history at the time of approval of your application. For British Virgin Islands the margin applicable to your account will depend on the banking relationship you maintain with the Bank at the time of approval of your application. For each billing period, the INTEREST CHARGE and the APR will be based on the Prime Rate current three business days prior to your account statement closing date. In the event that The Wall Street Journal is not published within any time period, the �LA TIMES� will be used as reference. An increase of the Prime Rate could represent an increase in the APR and in the minimum monthly payment. Any change in your INTEREST CHARGE will apply to the Balance in your account and to new transactions during the billing period. The INTEREST CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the number of days in the billing cycle. The Average Daily Balance is obtained by taking into account the initial balance for each day of the billing period, subtracting the payments and credits, and adding the purchases. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the said total is divided by the number of days included within the billing period

ANNUAL FEE
If applicable, the Annual Fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the Card.  Please refer to the �Annual Fee� section in the table included.

MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 
The monthly minimum payment will be determined using the Outstanding Balance. In addition, the minimum monthly payment shall include the total amount in excess of your authorized credit limit. For balances from $0.01 to $24.99 the Minimum Payment will be the Outstanding Balance. For Balances of $25 and over the Minimum Payment will be 2% of the Outstanding Balance or the Finance Charges + $10 or a fixed amount of $25, whichever is higher.

PAYMENT APPLICATION
If you pay the required minimum payment of the monthly Account Statement, said payment shall be applied in the following way: first to INTEREST CHARGES and the remaining amount shall be applied first to the debt resulting from purchases and cash advances, with the lowest APR and then to the debt with the higher APR in ascending order. Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required payment the excess will be applied to the most onerous debt. Electronic, telephone and mailed payments are credited on the same day if they are received by 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday (excluding holidays). Mailed payments shall be received at the address indicated on your Account Statement, made with a check drawn against the Bank, and accompanied with the payment stub. It will be also processed the same date if the payment is made through a Banco Popular branch in Puerto Rico or Virgin Islands during business hours in cash, or by check drawn against the Bank.

that accepts the Card. Cardholder agrees that the Account will not 
be used to access gambling web sites or to purchase illegal goods or 
services. Bank may refuse to process any transaction that Bank 
believes may violate this Agreement. If Cardholder provides the 
Account number to make a purchase or obtain an advance without 
presenting the Card (such as for a mail order or telephone pur-
chase), or if Cardholder authorizes someone else to make a charge 
to the Account, Cardholder's obligation to pay will be the same as if 
the Card itself was used. Cash Advances also may be obtained 
through use of the Card (a) upon execution of a written request of 
Cardholder in a form furnished by any financial institution that is a 
member, alone or in association with others, of Visa, Inc. or (b) upon 
Cardholder's execution of a written separate agreement with Bank 
for a Visa overdraft financial agreement, if offered by Bank. All Credit 
Purchases and Cash Advances are effected at the option of the 
retail merchant (""Seller"") and/or cash advancing financial institution 
respectively, and Bank shall not be responsible for refusal by any 
Seller or cash advancing financial institution to honor the Card or any 
""Related Card,"" as defined in paragraph 2 below. 

2. Obligations on the Account. Cardholder (jointly or severally if 
more than one) promises to pay Bank at the address specified on 
the periodic statement (see paragraph 5 below) for all Credit Pur-
chases and Cash Advances, together with any Finance Charge as 
herein provided, plus any other charges permitted by this Agree-
ment, all such payments must be in lawful money of the United 
States of America. Cardholder will pay in their equivalent in U.S. 
dollars all charges in a foreign currency, which equivalence will be 
determined by reference to the amount in U.S. dollars. Bank shall 
have paid in good faith to the person presenting the item to Bank. 
Cardholder shall be liable and agrees to pay Bank for Credit Pur-
chases made by, or for Cash Advances extended to, Cardholder or 
anyone else using the Card unless the use of such Card is by a 
person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, 
implied, or apparent authority for such use and (b) from which 
Cardholder receives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be 
jointly and severally liable, and agrees to pay, for all Credit Pur-
chases and Cash Advances obtained through the use of any other 
Card bearing Cardholder's Account number that has been issued to 
another person by reason of such person being a member of Card-
holder's family, or otherwise issued upon Cardholder's request (all 
such Cards bearing the same Account number hereinafter collec-
tively called ""Related Cards""). Subject to any mandatory provisions 
of applicable law, all payments made by Cardholder will be applied 
to the balances on Cardholder's Account in the manner set forth later 
in this Agreement. 

3. Credit Limit. Bank will inform Cardholder from time to time of the 
maximum amount of debt (""Credit Limit"") that may be outstanding in 
the Account at any time, and Bank, in its sole discretion may adjust 
the Credit Limit from time to time. Cardholder agrees not to use or 
permit the use of the Card in any manner that would cause the 
outstanding balance in the Account ever to exceed the Credit Limit. 
If Cardholder attempts a transaction which results in Cardholder�s 
total outstanding balance (plus authorizations) exceeding Card-
holder's Credit Limit, Bank may: (a) permit the transaction without 
raising Cardholder's Credit Limit; (b) permit the transaction and treat 
the amount of the transaction that is more than the Credit Limit as 
immediately due; or (c) refuse to permit the transaction. If Bank 
refuses to permit the transaction, Bank may advise the person who 
attempted the transaction that it has been refused. If Bank has 
previously permitted Cardholder to exceed Cardholder's Credit Limit, 
it does not mean that Bank will permit Cardholder to exceed Card-
holder's Credit Limit on a subsequent date. Bank may designate that 
only a portion of Cardholder's Credit Limit is available for Cash 
Advances. If Cardholder exceeds that limit, Cardholder will be 
considered to have exceeded the Credit Limit for all purposes under 
this Agreement. 

4. Notices. Bank will send periodic statements and any other notices 
to Cardholder at the address shown in Bank's files. If this is a joint 
Account, Bank can send periodic statements and notices to either 
Cardholder. Cardholder promises to inform Bank promptly, in writing, 
of any changes in Cardholder's address. 

5. Periodic Statement. As of the end of each monthly billing cycle, 
Cardholder will be furnished a periodic statement showing, among 
other things, (a) the amount owed (""Previous Balance"") at the 
beginning of the billing cycle, (b) the amount of all Cash Advances, 
Credit Purchases and Finance Charge posted to the Account during 
the billing cycle, (c) the amount of all payments and credits posted to 
the Account during the billing cycle, and (d) the total amount due 
(""New Balance"") at the end of the billing cycle (which amount is the 
sum of [a] and [b] less [c]), (e) the ""Minimum Payment,"" and (f) the 
""Payment Due Date."" If Cardholder is composed of more than one 
person, only one periodic statement will be provided. 

6. Minimum Payment. Cardholder agrees to pay to Bank, on or 
prior to the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, the 
sum of (a) either (i) the entire New Balance or (ii) at Cardholder's 
option, an amount which shall be at least 2.50% of the New Balance 
(rounded up to the nearest dollar) or $50.00, whichever is greater, 
and (b) any amount that is past due and any amount that is over the 
Credit Limit. If the New Balance is less than $50.00, it shall be paid 
in full. Cardholder may pay more than the Minimum Payment, and 
may at any time pay the full amount owing to Bank. If Cardholder 
pays more than the Minimum Payment, Cardholder must still pay the 
Minimum Payment as reflected on the next periodic statement. The 
Payment Due Date for a billing cycle will be twenty-five (25) days 
after the preceding billing cycle ends (the ""Closing Date""). 

7. Annual Fee. Bank does not charge an annual fee for the Card. 

8. Late Payment Fee. If Bank does not receive a payment from 
Cardholder in at least the amount of the Minimum Payment within 30 
days after the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, 
Bank may charge Cardholder a late payment fee in the amount 
stated below in the Table of Charges. Cardholder will only be 
charged a late payment fee for any Minimum Payment which is not 
paid within 30 days after the Payment Due Date. 

9. Cash Advance Fee. Each time Cardholder uses the Card or a 
Convenience Check to obtain a Cash Advance, Bank will assess a 
cash advance fee in the amount stated in the Table of Charges. 

10. When Finance Charge Begins. Bank adds a Finance Charge to 
the Account for all Cash Advances from the later of (a) the day the 
Cash Advance is posted to the Account, or (b) the first day of the 
billing cycle in which the Cash Advance is posted until Cardholder 
pays the transaction(s) in full. For Credit Purchases, Bank adds a 
Finance Charge to the Account if the Cardholder does not pay the 
New Balance in full by the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic 
statement. If Bank adds a Finance Charge, Bank begins to charge 
the Finance Charge on all amounts Cardholder owes Bank (except 
""New Purchases"") from the first day of the billing cycle. For New 
Purchases, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge from the date 
Bank posts the New Purchase to the Account unless Cardholder has 
paid the New Balance in full on the previous periodic statement. A 
New Purchase is one that appears on the periodic statement for the 
first time. 

11. Calculation of Finance Charge. Bank calculates the Finance 
Charge on the Account by applying the ""Periodic Rate"" (defined 
below) to the ""Average Daily Balance"" of the Account. To obtain the 
Average Daily Balance, Bank starts with the beginning balance of 
the Account on each day, excluding unpaid Finance Charges. Bank 
adds any Cash Advances posted to the Account that day, and any 
New Purchases, unless Cardholder paid the New Balance in full for 
the previous billing cycle by the Payment Due Date. Bank subtracts 
any credits and payments (after any unpaid Finance Charges are 
paid) posted to the Account that day. This results in the ""Daily 
Balance."" Then, Bank adds up all the Daily Balances for the billing 
cycle and divides that by the total number of days in the billing cycle. 
This results in the Average Daily Balance. The Finance Charge on 
the Account is calculated by multiplying the Average Daily Balance 
by the Periodic Rate which is .003542 as of 6/12/09.

* The �Prime Rate� is the highest prime rate published in the Money 
Rates column of the Wall Street Journal 30 days before the Closing 
Date on Cardholder�s periodic statement (the �Calculation Date�). 
The APR will go up and down depending on the Prime Rate as of 
each Calculation Date; however, the APR will change only on the 
first day of each billing cycle. If the Prime Rate and the correspond-
ing APR increase, the Finance Charge also will increase and Card-
holder�s Minimum Payment may be greater. 

12. Other Payment Terms. All payments received by 6 o'clock a.m. 
local time (at the location of the payment receipt) on Bank's business 
day at the address indicated on the periodic statement will be cred-
ited to the Account as of the date of receipt of payment. If payment 
is made at any other location, credit for the payment may be delayed 
up to 5 days. Bank can accept late or partial payments, as well as 
payments that are marked with ""Paid In Full"" or any other similar 
language without losing or waiving any of Bank�s rights or Card-
holder's obligations under this Agreement. Payments and credits to 
the Account will be applied in the following order: 

. Unpaid Finance Charge; 


. Late Fee; 


. Cash Advance from previous billing cycle; 


. Credit Purchases from previous billing cycle; 


. Cash Advances from current billing cycle; and 


. Credit Purchases from current billing cycle. 




13. Convenience Checks. Bank may issue ""Convenience Checks"" 
to Cardholder that may be used to access the Account. Use of a 
Convenience Check will be treated as a Cash Advance in the 
amount of the Check. Each Convenience Check will contain Card-
holder's Account Number, and may be used only by the person(s) 
whose name(s) is/are printed on it. Each Convenience Check must 
be completed and signed in the same way as a regular personal 
check. If Bank provides Convenience Checks for the Account, 
Cardholder may not use them to pay any amount Cardholder owes 
under this Agreement. Cardholder agrees that Bank need not return 
Convenience Checks to Cardholder after their use, and that, if 
Cardholder needs evidence of any payment represented by the 
Convenience Check, a photocopy or similar reproduction will be 
satisfactory for such purposes. If Cardholder wishes to prevent 
payment of a Convenience Check, the instructions which Bank 
provides when the Convenience Checks are issued must be fol-
lowed. In the event payment of a Convenience Check has been 
stopped, Cardholder agrees to hold Bank harmless and indemnify 
Bank for any losses, expenses and costs, including attorney's fees 
incurred by Bank, for preventing payment of any Convenience 
Check. Bank will use its best efforts to stop payment, but will incur 
no liability to Cardholder if it is unable to stop payment on a Conven-
ience Check. 

14. Termination. Bank may terminate Cardholder's privileges under 
this Agreement or limit Cardholder's right to make Credit Purchases 
or receive Cash Advances at any time (and list Cardholder's Account 
in warning bulletins in the event of such termination) without any 
reason or without advance notice or resulting liability. If Bank re-
quests, Cardholder must return the Card and Convenience Checks 
to Bank. Cardholder agrees that Cardholder will not try to make a 
Credit Purchase or obtain a Cash Advance after Cardholder has 
been notified that Cardholder's privilege to use the Account has 
been terminated. Cardholder may terminate this Agreement at any 
time. If Cardholder does terminate, all Cards and Convenience 
Checks previously issued on the Account must be returned to Bank. 
If Cardholder telephones Bank with the termination request, Bank 
may require that Cardholder confirm such intent to terminate in 
writing. Bank's or Cardholder's termination will not affect Card-
holder's existing obligations under this Agreement or Cardholder's 
liability for all charges posted to Cardholder's Account prior to the 
time all Cards and Convenience Checks are returned to Bank. When 
the Account is closed, Cardholder must contact everyone authorized 
to charge transactions to the Account, such as internet service 
providers, health clubs or insurance companies. These transactions 
may continue to be charged to the Account until Cardholder changes 
the billing. Also, if the Bank believes Cardholder has authorized a 
transaction or is attempting to use Cardholder�s Account after 
Cardholder has requested to close the Account, Bank may allow the 
transaction to be charged to the Account. 


15. Default. If (a) Cardholder defaults in any payment required to be 
made on the Account or otherwise violates any provision of this 
Agreement, or (b) Cardholder dies or seeks to obtain any relief as a 
debtor in any proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or 
debtor relief law, or (c) Cardholder provides Bank with false or 
misleading information or signatures at any time, or (d) Cardholder 
fails to make any payment or perform any promise in any other 
agreement or obligation that Cardholder owes Bank, then Bank will 
be in default under this Agreement. Bank, upon such default, may at 
its election (a) decline to extend further credit under this Agreement 
(and Cardholder agrees not to make further Credit Purchases or to 
obtain further Cash Advances) and (b) declare all amounts then 
owed to Bank by Cardholder immediately due and payable, without 
prior notice or demand of any kind, except as may be required by 
applicable law. After Bank declares all amounts then owed to Bank 
by Cardholder to be due and payable, and terminates Cardholder�s 
credit privileges under the Account Bank, at its option, may increase 
the Annual Percentage Rate up to 18%. 

16. Collection Charges. If Cardholder defaults, to the extent permit-
ted by applicable law, Cardholder agrees to pay (a) all amounts 
actually incurred by Bank as court costs and attorneys' fees set by a 
court in connection with the collection of amounts due by Cardholder 
under the Account and (b) premiums or other identifiable charges 
received in connection with the permitted sale of insurance. In 
addition, Bank may impose on Cardholder a processing fee of 
$20.00 if a check provided to Bank by Cardholder is dishonored for 
any reason. The dishonored check processing fee may be added to 
the New Balance and is payable on the next following due date, 
however, such fee will not accrue any Finance Charge. 

17. Governing Law. This Agreement is performable in Texas and is 
made pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Fi-
nance Code, as amended. THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, AND 
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL MATTERS 
ARISING OUT OF THE ISSUANCE AND USE OF THE CARD 
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF 
TEXAS AND, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, THE LAWS OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 

18. Amendment. The terms of this Agreement including, but not 
limited to, the rate or index, formula or provision of law used to 
compute the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are subject to revision 
as to current and future balances, from time to time, by written notice 
from Bank to Cardholder as provided by applicable law. 

19. Telephone Conversations. Cardholder agrees that Bank, its 
agents, or service companies may monitor and/or record any tele-
phone communications with Cardholder. 

20. Liability for Unauthorized Use. Cardholder may be liable for 
unauthorized use of the Account. If the Card is lost or stolen, or if 
Cardholder believes someone is using the Account without proper 
authority, Cardholder must notify Bank immediately by calling 1-800-
325-3678. Cardholder will not be liable for unauthorized use that 
occurs after Cardholder notifies Bank of the loss or theft of the Card 
or Convenience Check, or the possible unauthorized use of the 
Account. Bank may terminate or limit access to the Account if 
Cardholder has notified Bank, or if Bank has determined that the 
Card or Convenience Check may have been lost or stolen, or that 
there may be unauthorized access to the Account. Cardholder 
agrees to provide Bank with complete cooperation in Bank's efforts 
to recover any stolen Card or Convenience Check and amounts due 
from unauthorized users, and in prosecuting unauthorized users. 

21. Bank�s Liability for Failing to Make Transfers. If Bank does 
not complete a transaction to or from the Account on time or in the 
correct amount according to this Agreement, Bank may be liable for 
Cardholder's losses or damages. However, there are some excep-
tions. Bank will not be liable, for instance: (a) if, through no fault of 
Bank's, the available credit is insufficient for the transaction or is 
unavailable for withdrawal (for example, because funds have not 
been finally collected or are subject to legal process); (b) if a com-
puter system, ATM, or point of sale terminal did not have enough 
cash or was not working properly and Cardholder knew about the 
problem when Cardholder started the transaction; (c) if Cardholder 
attempts to use the Account or the Card which has not been properly 
activated; (d) if the Card has been reported as lost or stolen, has 
been suspended by Bank or Bank has reason to believe the transac-
tion is not authorized by Cardholder, or if Cardholder is trying to 
defraud Bank; or (e) as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

22. Assignment of Account. Cardholder agrees that Bank may at 
any time assign and transfer Cardholder's Account, this Agreement, 
and Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, without 
Cardholder's consent or notice to Cardholder. The person to whom 
the Account and Agreement is assigned shall be entitled to all of 
Bank's rights under this Agreement. 

23. Information Sharing. Cardholder authorizes Bank to share 
information concerning Cardholder and Cardholder�s Account with 
companies related to Bank by common ownership. Cardholder 
authorizes Bank to share information with companies in which Bank 
has an ownership interest, concerning purchases made by Card-
holder using Cardholder�s Account, for the purpose of obtaining 
special merchandise offers or discounts for Cardholder. Cardholder 
does not authorize Bank to disclose Cardholder�s name, address, 
telephone number or other personal information to these companies. 

24. Credit Reporting Agencies. Bank may give information about 
Cardholder's payment history under this Agreement to other persons 
or companies when permitted by law. Cardholder authorizes Bank to 
make whatever credit or investigative inquiries Bank deems neces-
sary in the course of review of any credit extended under this Agree-
ment. A negative credit report which may affect Cardholder's credit 
record may be submitted to a credit reporting agency if Cardholder 
fails to keep Cardholder's promises under this Agreement. 

25. Delay of Rights. Bank can waive or delay enforcement of any of 
its rights under this Agreement without losing them. 

26. Separable Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held 
to be invalid or enforceable, the rest of this Agreement will not be 
affected. Cardholder will not be held liable for Finance Charges or 
other fees and charges greater than the maximum allowed by law 
that applies. 

27. Limitation of Responsibility. Bank will not be responsible for 
merchandise or services purchased by Cardholder with the Card or 
Convenience Check unless required by law. Any refund, adjustment 
or credit allowed by a Seller shall not be cash, but rather be by a 
credit advice to Bank which shall be shown as a credit on the peri-
odic statement. Bank will not be responsible for the refusal of any 
person to honor the Card or Convenience Check or if Cardholder is 
not able to use the Card at an ATM. (a) Bank will not be responsible 
for merchandise or services purchased by Cardholder with the Card 
or Convenience Check unless required by law. Any refund, adjust-
ment or credit allowed by a Seller shall not be cash, but rather be by 
a credit advice to Bank which shall be shown as a credit on the 
periodic statement. Bank will not be responsible for the refusal of 
any person to honor the Card or Convenience Check or if Card-
holder is not able to use the Card at an ATM[; and (b) BANK WILL 
NOT BE LIABLE TO CARDHOLDER FOR DELAYS OR MISTAKES 
RESULTING FROM ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND BANK'S 
CONTROL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTS OF GOV-
ERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, NATIONAL EMERGENCIES, IN-
SURRECTION, WAR, OR RIOTS; THE FAILURE OF MERCHANTS 
TO HONOR THE CARD; THE FAILURE OF MERCHANTS TO 
PERFORM OR PROVIDE SERVICES; COMMUNICATION SYS-
TEMFAILURES; OR FAILURES OR MALFUNCTIONS ATTRIBUT-
ABLE TO CARDHOLDER'S EQUIPMENT, ANY INTERNET SER-
VICE, OR ANY PAYMENT SYSTEM. IN THE EVENT THAT BANK 
IS HELD LIABLE TO CARDHOLDER, CARDHOLDER WILL ONLY 
BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER CARDHOLDER'S ACTUAL DAM-
AGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL CARDHOLDER BE ENTITLED TO 
RECOVER ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR 
SPECIAL DAMAGES (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR 
OTHERWISE), EVEN IF CARDHOLDER HAS ADVISED BANK OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS PROVISION 
SHALL NOT BE EFFECTIVE TO THE EXTENT OTHERWISE 
PROHIBITED BY LAW. 

28. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies. If Cardholder 
makes a transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be 
converted by Visa into a U.S. dollar amount in accordance with the 
operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time 
that the transaction is processed. Currently, those regulations and 
procedures provide that the currency conversion rate to be used is 
either (a) a wholesale market rate or (b) a government-mandated 
rate in effect one (1) day prior to the processing date, increased by 
one percent (1%) in each case. Visa retains this one percent as 
compensation for performing the currency conversion service. The 
currency conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ 
from the rate in effect on the transaction date or the posting date. 

29. USA Patriot Act. Bank is subject to the requirement of the USA 
Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107 56 [signed into law October 26, 
2001]) (the �Act�) and hereby notifies Cardholder that pursuant to the 
requirements of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify, and record 
information that identifies Cardholder which information includes the 
name and address of Cardholder and other information that will allow 
such Bank to identify Cardholder in accordance with the Act. 

30. Other Agreements. This Agreement supersedes all prior Agree-
ments between Bank and Cardholder governing the use of the Card 
and the Account.

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS 

This Notice contains important information about your rights and our 
responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. For purposes of this 
Notice, ""we"" and ""us"" mean Bank, and ""you"" and ""your"" mean the 
Cardholder. 

Notify Us in Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill. If you 
think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a 
transaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet of paper at the 
address listed on your bill. Write to us as soon as possible. We must 
hear from you not later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on 
which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but 
doing so will not preserve your rights. 

In your letter, please give us the following information: 

. Your name and Account Number. 


. The dollar amount of the suspected error. 




Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is 
an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are 
unsure about. 

You do not have to pay any amount in question while we are investi-
gating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are 
not in question. While we investigate your question, we cannot report 
you as delinquent or take any action to collect the amount you 
question. 

Special Rule for Credit Card Purchases. If you have a problem 
with the quality of goods or services that you purchased with a Credit 
Card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the 
merchant, you may not have to pay the remaining amount due on 
the goods or services. You have this protection only when the 
purchase price was more than $50 and the purchase was made in 
your home state or within 100 miles of your mailing address. (If we 
own or operate the merchant, or if we mailed the advertisement for 
the property or services, all purchases are covered regardless of 
amount or location of purchase.)

1. 
INTRODUCTION. This Agreement covers your VlSA Credit Card (�Card�)issued through iQ Credit Union. In this Agreement the words �you�, �your�and �yours� mean any joint obligator, guarantor, authorized user or the personwhose name is embossed on the Card. The words �we�, �us� and �our� mean iQ Credit Union. 

Y
You do not have to sign this agreement, but once you or any person permitted or allowed by you has received this Card, any other card issued for this account or card privilege, and retained it, signed it, or used it, you and they will be bound by the terms and conditions of it, just as if you and they have signed it. 

2. 
YOU PROMISE TO PAY. You promise to pay us in United States dollars, bycash, check or money order as provided by this agreement, all such amounts, plus FINANCE CHARGES which arise from such use of the Card by you or any other person, and to be jointly and severally liable with such a person,unless such other person does not have actual, implied or apparent authorityfor such use, and you received no bene.t for the use. 

3. 
PURCHASES AND CASH ADVANCES. You may use your account for purchases of services and merchandise from participating sellers or lessors of goods, labor, insurance, and/or services that honor your Card. You may not use your card for any illegal or unlawful transactions, and we may decline to authorize any transaction that we believe poses an undue risk of illegality or unlawfulness. You may also use your account and Card to get cash advances from participating .nancial institutions. You may use your card and personalidenti.cation number to obtain cash advances at automated teller machines designated with the VISA or Plus System networks. The monthly statement will identify the merchant or .nancial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advance, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. You will retain the copy of such slips furnished at the time of the transaction in order to verify the monthly statement. The Credit Union maymake a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request. 

4. 
CONVENIENCE CHECKS. If we approve, you may obtain advances under your account by writing preprinted loan drafts (convenience checks) that we supply to you. Your use of convenience checks will be shown as credit advances on your periodic statement. We may not honor the convenience check if it is post-dated, payment of the check will exceed your credit limit, a convenience check is signed by a person without authorized access, the amount of the check is less than the minimum required amount, your account has been terminated or suspended, or any convenience checks have been reportedlost or stolen. You may stop payment on a convenience check if you provide us with the exact information describing the convenience check. If you give us incorrect information, we will not be responsible for failing to stop payment.You understand there may be a charge for convenience check printing and charges for stop payment requests, returned items, check copies, and other fees or costs we incur in handling your convenience checks. Our liability for a wrongful dishonor is limited to your actual losses; however, a dishonor for the reasons stated above is not a wrongful dishonor. 

5. 
PERIODIC STATEMENTS. If at the end of any monthly periodic interval which we may determine the �Billing Cycle�, you have an outstanding undisputed debit or credit balance in your account, or if there is any FINANCE CHARGE imposed with respect to your account, we will send you a periodic statement regarding the account for that Billing Cycle. The statement will show any purchases, cash advances, and payments or credits made to yourAccount during that billing cycle, as well as your �New Balance�.

You may pay in full for all your purchasesand cash advances each month or you may repay in monthly installments. You agree that the periodic statement is correct and accepted by you unless we receive from you proper written noti.cation of a billing error, within 60 daysafter we mailed the periodic statement to you. 

6. 
CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH A FINANCE CHARGE WILL BE IMPOSED. The total outstanding balance of purchases and cash advances 


in the Account on the closing date of any Billing Cycle, including any FINANCE CHARGE, will be shown on the Periodic Statement for that Billing Cycle as the �New Balance�. 
(a) 
PURCHASES. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on purchases included in the New Balance and transactions for purchases posted during the followingBilling Cycle when your New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the closing date of the Billing Cycle. 

(b) 
CASH ADVANCES. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances from the date posted to the account to the date paid. The FINANCE CHARGE as disclosed on the statement is only .gured throughthe statement date. The FINANCE CHARGE will continue to accrue from that date to the date paid. There is no time within which to pay to avoid this FINANCE CHARGE. In addition, a cash advance fee FINANCE CHARGE equal to 2% of the cash advance (or $5.00, whichever is greater) will be applied to each cash advance. 


7. 
THE METHOD OF DETERMINING THE BALANCE UPON WHICHAFINANCE CHARGE MAY BE IMPOSED. The FINANCE CHARGE on your account will be .gured by applying the Daily Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of your account including current transactions and multiplying this .gure by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. To compute the �Average Daily Balance�, we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new Purchases/ Cash Advances and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid FINANCE CHARGES. This gives us the daily balances. Then we add up all the daily balances for the Billing Cycle and divide the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the �Average Daily Balance�. 

8. 
METHOD OF DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF THE FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE based on a periodic rate is .gured by applying the DailyPeriodic Rate to the Average Daily Balance of purchases and cash advances bythe number of days in the Billing Cycle. The Daily Periodic Rate for VISA classic purchases is .038356%, with a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 14.00%. The Daily Periodic Rate for VISA Gold purchases is .035479%, with a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 12.95%. The Daily Periodic rate for cash advances (including balance transfers) on VISA Classic Gold accounts is .04654% with a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 16.99%. 


DAILY PERIODIC ANNUAL Visa Classic .038356% 14% Visa Gold .035479% 12.95% 
The FINANCE CHARGE for any Billing Cycle will be the sum of the FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and the FINANCE CHARGE for cash advances. However, the portion of your balance that is the result of purchases has a different treatment if you pay all of that portion by at least twenty-.ve (25 days) after we send you your billing statement. In that event, we will zero out the FINANCE CHARGE that would otherwise be charged on that portion of your account balance. For this purpose, payment will be applied .rst to unpaid FINANCE CHARGE, then to unpaid purchases and cash advances from prior billing statements (starting with the portion of the balance subject to the lowest interest rate.�

CEFCU VISA PLATINUM AND PLATINUM REWARDS CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT
This CEFCU� VISA� Platinum and Platinum Rewards Cardholder Agreement (�this agreement�) contains the terms and conditions which govern your CEFCU Platinum or Platinum Rewards VISA Credit Card and account. This agreement replaces all earlier agreements related to the Card and account. Please read the entire agreement and keep it for your records.
Throughout this agreement, the word �Card� means the CEFCU Platinum or Platinum Rewards VISA Credit Card(s) issued by CEFCU to you. The word �Card� also includes any other access devices, such as account numbers and Convenience Checks that we have issued to permit you to obtain credit under this agreement. The primary cardholder�s account number may differ from the other cardholder(s) account number(s), but all are part of the same account. We may issue Cards to renew your current Card or substitute and replace it with a different type of Card if your current type of Card is discontinued or for other reasons. The word �Card� also includes any renewal or substitute Card.
Throughout this agreement, the words �we�, �us�, �our� and �CEFCU� mean Citizens Equity First Credit Union, the issuer of your Card and account. The words �you� and �your� mean the primary cardholder, any other cardholder(s) and any person who has been authorized by you to receive and use the Card.
If at your request, we used your account to issue supplementary Cards to others, �you� will also mean each one of you. All of you individually and together agree to be bound by this agreement. In addition, this agreement will be binding on your personal and legal representatives.
Please sign the back of your Card when you receive it. You will be bound by this agreement even if you don�t sign your Card. If we have issued a Card to you; provided you with a renewal or replacement Card; or provided you with Convenience Checks, and you keep or use the Card or Convenience Checks, it means that you understand and agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. Your application for a Card and all other disclosure documents which we provide to you form an integral part of this agreement. 
USING YOUR ACCOUNT
Provided that your account is in good standing, you may draw on it by using your Card, by use of your Card together with your Personal Identification Number (PIN), by use of your account number without presenting your Card or by use of a CEFCU VISA Convenience Check provided you by CEFCU (�Convenience Check(s)� and/or other access devices included in the word �Card� when referring herein collectively to the access devices that we have issued to permit you to obtain credit under this agreement) wherever the Card or Convenience Checks are accepted or by Balance Transfers we allow or by Overdraft Protection we approve and up to the maximum amount we have set as your credit limit. We are not responsible for refusal by anyone to accept your Card or Convenience Check. You promise to use your account only for valid and lawful transactions. You agree not to use your account for internet gambling transactions or any illegal purpose or illegal transaction. Any such use by you will constitute (i) a waiver by you of any right to sue CEFCU respecting any such gambling transaction, illegal purpose or illegal transaction by you and (ii) your agreement to indemnify and hold CEFCU free and harmless from and against any suits or other legal action or liability, directly or indirectly, resulting from such gambling transaction, illegal purpose or illegal transaction by you. It is not our responsibility to make sure that you use your account only for permissible transactions, and you will remain responsible for paying for a transaction even if it is not permissible. You authorize us to pay for and charge your account for all transactions made on your account. 
Types Of Transactions
�	Purchases: You may use your Card to pay for goods or services.
�	Convenience Checks: We may provide you with Convenience Checks as a way to use your account. All transactions using Convenience Checks will be treated as Cash Advances and will be subject to the terms of this agreement that apply to Cash Advances unless you are notified otherwise in a written notice from CEFCU at the time we provide you with the Convenience Checks. All Convenience Checks issued prior to November 30, 2009, will be treated as Cash Advances and will be subject to the terms of this Agreement that apply to Cash Advances. Convenience Checks must be ordered through CEFCU. Only a person whose name is printed on a Convenience Check may sign it. All Convenience Checks must be written in U.S. Dollars. CEFCU will not certify a Convenience Check. CEFCU is entitled to return a Convenience Check unpaid if there is not enough available credit on your account to pay it, if you are in default under this agreement, if your Card or Convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen, if the Convenience Check is post-dated (shows a future date), or if the Convenience Check was not ordered through CEFCU. An interest charge will be imposed from the date a Convenience Check is posted to your account until the date it is fully paid. A Convenience Check cannot be used to make a payment on your account. Convenience Checks issued prior to January 1, 2009, will no longer be accepted.
�	Cash Advances: You may use your Card together with a PIN to obtain Cash Advances at any Automated Teller Machine (ATM) that allows you to use the Card. You may also obtain Cash Advances from financial institutions, businesses or merchants that accept the Card. If your Card is used to obtain a Cash Advance, you are deemed to have authorized the transaction. If you use the Card to obtain travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers or similar cash-like charges; or to obtain lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar gambling transactions, these transactions will be treated as Cash Advances. 
�	Balance Transfers: You may transfer balances from other accounts or loans with other credit card issuers or other lenders to your Card, or other Balance Transfers we allow. But you may not transfer balances to your Card from other accounts with us. If a portion of a requested balance transfer will exceed your available credit limit, we may process a partial balance transfer up to your available credit limit. A Balance Transfer will be processed by payment drawn on the account and made by us directly to the other credit card issuers or other lenders. 
�	Overdraft Protection: If CEFCU offers you Overdraft Protection from the account and if you have requested and we have approved Overdraft Protection for a Checking Account maintained with CEFCU (�Checking Account�) and provided your account is in good standing, you may draw on the account by making an Overdraft Protection funds transfer from the account to the Checking Account in accordance with the CEFCU Deposit Account Agreement and Rate and Fee Schedule. All funds will be transferred in increments of $100 and will be treated as Cash Advances and will be subject to the terms of this agreement that apply to Cash Advances. You acknowledge and agree that we may refuse an Overdraft Protection funds transfer from the account if the transfer would exceed the credit limit of the account. You further acknowledge and agree that anyone who is authorized to make withdrawals from the Checking Account may access your account through Overdraft Protection and that person will be an authorized user.
Mail, Telephone Or Internet Purchases
If you incur debt on your account without presentation of your Card (such as for mail or internet orders or telephone Purchases), your obligation to us will be the same as if the Card was used and a sales draft was signed by you.
Authorized Users
If you allow someone to use your account, that person will be an authorized user. You should think carefully before allowing anyone to become an authorized user because you are allowing that person to use the account as you can. You will remain responsible for the use of your account and each Card issued on your account according to the terms of this agreement. This includes your responsibility for paying all obligations reflecting Purchases and Cash Advances charged to your account by an authorized user.
You may request an additional Card for use by an authorized user on your account. If you do so, this account may appear on the credit report of that authorized user. If you have previously authorized someone to use your Card or Convenience Checks, and have subsequently withdrawn your authorization, you will continue to be liable for all obligations incurred by that person�s use of your Card prior to termination of that person�s permission to use your account.
You must notify us to terminate an authorized user�s permission to use your account. If you notify us, we may close the account and/or issue a new Card or Cards with a different account number. 
An authorized user�s permission to use your account will be considered terminated when we close the account and/or issue a new Card or Cards with a different account number. You should also recover and destroy any Cards, Convenience Checks or any other means of access to your account from that authorized user.
Not Exceeding Your Credit Limit
You agree not to incur any obligations in excess of the credit limit of the account authorized for you by CEFCU. The credit limit will be indicated in a separate disclosure document and/or on the cardmailer accompanying your Card and/or on your monthly statement. You may ask for a credit limit increase by calling: 1-800-858-3400 or (309) 633-3400.
If you exceed your credit limit, CEFCU may: (a) require the immediate payment of the amount in excess of the credit limit; (b) charge your account without waiving its right to demand immediate payment of the amount in excess of the credit limit; (c) refuse to permit any Purchases, Balance Transfers or Cash Advances in excess of the credit limit; and (d) reverse any Purchases, Balance Transfers or Cash Advances in excess of the credit limit as a result of the fault of the merchant or person selling the goods or services. This agreement applies to any balance over your credit limit. Subject to applicable law and at our discretion, we may increase, reduce or cancel your credit limit or allow you to exceed your credit limit without giving notice to you. However, if you have asked us not to do so, we will not increase your credit limit. A change to your credit limit will not affect your obligation to pay us. We reserve the right to refuse to honor any use of the Card or Convenience Checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit. 
Transactions In Foreign Currency
If you use your Card for transactions in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, the transactions will be converted by VISA to U.S. Dollars, using either (1) a rate selected by VISA from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives or (2) the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The currency conversion rate for the applicable central processing date may differ from the rate in effect at the time of the transaction or on the date the transaction is posted to your account. If a credit is subsequently given for a transaction and has a different central processing date, then the exchange rate of the credit may be greater or less than that of the original transaction. You agree to accept the converted amount in U.S. Dollars.
Refusal To Authorize Transactions
We may, but are not required to, decline a transaction on your account because of operational considerations, because your account is in default, to protect against potential fraudulent or unlawful activity, or in our discretion, for any other reason.
Should a transaction on your account be declined either by us or a third party, even if you have sufficient credit available, we will not be responsible for any losses that may result. For online transactions, we may require that you register your account with the �Verified by Visa� authorization system or such other authorization system as we may direct to protect you and us. We will notify you if we want you to register. If you do not register, we may not be able to honor your online transactions.



Loss, Theft Or Unauthorized Use
You will inform us immediately by telephone and in writing about any actual or suspected loss, theft or unauthorized use of your Card, account number, PIN or Convenience Checks. Notify us in writing at CEFCU, P.O. Box 1715, Peoria, Illinois 61656-1715 and by phone at (800) 633-7077 or (309) 633-7000, of the loss, theft or possible unauthorized use. You agree that we will consider that all transactions have been authorized by you until you advise us otherwise.
If your Card is lost or stolen, you will not be liable for unauthorized use of your Card. However, you must identify for us the unauthorized charges from which you received no benefit. We may ask for your assistance with our investigation by providing us information in writing to help us find out what happened.
Keep Your PIN Confidential
You agree to keep your PIN confidential and separate from your Card at all times. 
Ownership Of Card
You agree that the Card remains the property of CEFCU and will be surrendered to CEFCU on demand; and, that you do not have the right to assign or transfer your rights and obligations under this agreement, your account or any Cards to anyone else.
Observing Your Card�s Expiration Date
If your Card contains an expiration date, you agree not to use it or any Convenience Checks after such expiration date. If they are used, you agree to pay any debts that are incurred.
ATMs
The availability of ATM services and the Cash Advance amount you can withdraw each day may vary from time to time and without prior notice to you. We are not liable if ATM services are not available or for any loss or damage you may suffer because of your use of an ATM.
PAYMENTS
Providing You With Account Statements
We will send you a monthly account statement if there have been transactions during the last month or if you owe us any money on the account. The number of days covered by each account statement may vary (normally between 28 and 33 days) as a result of several factors, including holidays, weekends and the different number of business days in each month. We will send account statements only to the primary cardholder at the most current statement mailing address that we have on file. The statement shall be conclusively deemed correct and accepted by you unless CEFCU receives a proper written notification of a billing error within 60 days of the first mailing or delivery to you of the monthly statement on which the disputed item(s) or amount(s) is/are reflected. 
Repaying Your Obligations
When you access your account in a manner that we permit, or when you authorize others to use it, you will incur an obligation. You agree to pay all obligations reflecting Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances charged to your account because of authorized use of the Card by you and/or any person authorized by you to use the same upon presentment of such obligations to CEFCU. The primary cardholder agrees that, whether or not the other cardholder(s) is/are a member of CEFCU and whether or not the other cardholder(s)� Card(s) has/have a separate number and/or is/are embossed with the other cardholder(s)� name, he or she is primarily liable for paying all obligations reflecting Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances charged to the account. We will add a Finance Charge, fees and other applicable charges to your obligations and these amounts will form part of your obligations. You agree to pay CEFCU for all such obligations, at such place as CEFCU designates, with applicable interest charges and any Fees that may be due, in accordance with billings and the current Extended Payment Schedule. Interest charges shall continue to accrue until the principal balance is paid in full.
Keeping Your Account In Good Standing
When you incur obligations on your account, we will send you an account statement which will indicate the payment due date. If you do not repay your obligations in full by the payment due date, you agree to make the minimum monthly payment which we will indicate on your account statement. A Minimum Payment will appear on your account statement and payment of not less than the amount thereof must be made within 25 days after the Statement Date. The Minimum Payment will be the sum of (i) the amount determined in accordance with the following Extended Payment Schedule (Preliminary Minimum Payment), (ii) any amount past due, and (iii) any amount by which your New Balance exceeds your authorized credit limit. Extended Payment Schedule:  If the New Balance is $10.00 or less, the Preliminary Minimum Payment will be the New Balance in full. If the New Balance is more than $10.00, the Preliminary Minimum Payment will be 3% of the New Balance, or $10.00, whichever is greater. Any past due or over credit limit amount must be paid as soon as you receive your account statement. We may allow you, from time to time, to omit a monthly payment and we will notify you in writing when this option is available. If you choose to exercise this option, interest charges will continue to accrue.
Applying Your Payments
Your payment will be applied in a manner we determine. Subject to applicable law, we will apply your payment amounts in excess of your minimum payment (to the extent sufficient) to pay balances with higher interest charges before applying it to balances with lower interest charges. Subject to applicable law, we may adjust from time to time the date we use to determine the applicable interest rates and balances for applying your payment amounts in excess of your minimum payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a balance on your account is subject to deferred interest or a similar program under which you are not obligated to pay interest on that balance if you pay that balance in full within a specified period, we will apply your payment amounts in excess of your minimum payment during the two billing cycles immediately preceding the expiration of that specified period (to the extent sufficient) to pay that balance. Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to change the order in which we apply payments. The sooner you pay the New Balance, the less you will pay in interest charges.
Acceptance Of Late Or Partial Payments
We may delay enforcing our rights under this agreement and may accept late payments, partial payments and payments marked as �paid in full� or containing similar wording without losing any rights that we have under this agreement or by law, including the right to recover in full all amounts that you owe to us on your account.

Skip Payment Option
We may, at our option, allow you to skip a payment from time to time. You will be notified in advance of when this option is available to you. You may continue to make regular payments as determined in this agreement and/or additional payments if you wish and you will reduce the amount of interest charges that you will have to pay if you do so. If you exercise the skip payment option when it is made available to you, you will not be charged a Late Fee for those payments skipped. However, if you exercise the skip payment option when it is made available to you, interest charges and insurance premiums, if any, will continue to accrue on the entire unpaid balance of your account during that skip payment period in accordance with this agreement. The statement sent to you immediately following the skip payment period will indicate the Minimum Payment due. At that time, your Minimum Payments will return to the amount computed in accordance with the terms of this agreement and be due on the due dates as specified in this agreement.
Applying Credit Receipts
If you use your Card or Convenience Checks for a transaction which is subsequently cancelled and you are given a credit receipt, we will credit your account by the amount shown on the credit receipt within three (3) business days after our receipt of the credit transaction. The credit will be processed as of the posting date, not the transaction date for purposes of the Average Daily Balance calculation.
Credit Balances
You may request a refund of a credit balance at any time. We may reduce the amount of any credit balance by the amount of new charges or fees billed to your account. We will not pay you interest on any credit balances. If your account has a credit balance for four (4) or more consecutive statements we may refund the credit balance to your Savings account with us.
Right To Offset
If you have more than one account with us, and if any one of your accounts is not in good standing, you agree that we may offset your credit balance against the balance of the account which is not in good standing.
Pre-Authorized Debits
You may authorize a third party to automatically charge your account for repeat transactions by way of a pre-authorized debit (for example, monthly utility charges, memberships and insurance premiums). If pre-authorized debits are stopped for any reason (including because your account is closed or suspended for any reason) or your account number changes, you are responsible for notifying the biller and paying these charges directly. If your account number changes, we may, but are not required to, pay from your new account number charges that you authorized to be billed to your old account number.
Promotions
From time to time we may offer special terms for your account. If we do, we will notify you about the terms of the offer and how long they will be in effect. Any promotion is subject to the terms of this agreement, as modified by the promotional offer.

INTEREST CHARGES
The Conditions Under Which Interest Charges Will be Imposed
Cash Advances/Convenience Checks. We will begin charging interest on Cash Advances on the transaction date, unless the Cash Advance transaction is not posted to your account until a date in a billing cycle beginning after the billing cycle in which the Cash Advance transaction occurred, and, in that event, interest will be imposed from the first day of the billing cycle in which the Cash Advance transaction is posted to your account, and will continue until the date Payment is received by CEFCU. Any Cash Advance you obtain on your account and any transaction by which you purchase items that are directly convertible to cash will constitute Cash Advances. Examples of such transactions are the purchase of money orders, wire transfer money orders, casino gaming chips, opening deposits, travelers checks, Visa Travel Money Cards and foreign currency. Unless otherwise provided in a written notice from CEFCU to you sent with the convenience check on or after November 30, 2009, all Convenience Check transactions are considered Cash Advances. There is no time period within which to avoid this interest charge.
Purchases and Balance Transfers. Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any interest on Purchases and Balance Transfers if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month.  If you do not pay your entire balance by the due date, interest will be imposed from the date the Purchase or Balance Transfer transaction occurs, unless the Purchase or Balance Transfer transaction is not posted to your account until a later billing cycle in which event interest on that Purchase or Balance Transfer will be imposed from the first day of the billing cycle in which it is posted to your account, and will continue until the date payment is received by CEFCU. Interest charge will also be imposed on Purchases and Balance Transfers included in the New Balance when the New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the Statement Date.
The Method Of Determining The Balance Subject To Interest Rate
Interest charge will be imposed on the �Average Daily Balance� of Cash Advances, the �Average Daily Balance� of Balance Transfers and the �Average Daily Balance� of Purchases on your account, including current transactions (those occurring since your last billing statement). We figure the interest charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of your account (including current transactions).

The card carrier, accompanying documents, and application are part of and incorporated into this Agreement. The word Card means a single VISA card or two or more VISA cards and any renewal or substitutes issued for the Card. The words you, yours, and Holder mean the applicant(s) and anyone else the applicant(s) permits to use the Card. The words we, us, our, and Issuer mean KEMBA Financial Credit Union, and its successors or assignees. 
1. Use of Card. You can use your Card to buy or lease goods and obtain services or insurance (�Purchases�) wherever the Card is honored and to get instant cash loans (�Cash Advances�) from any financial institution that accepts the Card. You will owe us for all Purchases and Cash Advances charged by the use of the Card, plus any other charges (�Debits�) to your Account made under the terms of this Agreement, plus any finance charges, all payable in U.S. dollars and as required by this Agreement. The Card shall remain the property of Issuer, who may at any time revoke its use and demand its immediate surrender pursuant to Section 18 of this Agreement. You agree not to use your Card for any transaction that may be illegal, or any transaction in connection with Internet gambling. 
2. Balance Transfers. You may use your Card or Account to transfer balances from other credit card accounts to this Account (�Balance Transfers�) by means (including balance transfer forms) we may make available from time to time. You may not transfer balances from any other account you have with us. 
3. Credit Line. Your Credit Line is listed on Page 1 of your Account Details Disclosure. Your Credit Line may be changed from time to time and your current Credit Line will be listed on your monthly billing statement. We will not authorize Purchases, Balance Transfers, or Cash Advances that cause your account to exceed your Credit Line. 
4. Statements and Payments. If you have a balance or activity on your Account, we will send you a monthly statement that will show, separately, your Purchases/Debits Account, your Cash Advance Account, Balance Transfers Account, finance charges to your Account, the minimum payment due, and the date the payment is due. You can pay all of your outstanding balance on your Card at any time, but you must make at least a minimum payment of 2.5% of your Account balance or $25 (whichever is greater) plus any amount in excess of your Credit Line and any past due amount, within 21 days of the date of each monthly statement. You agree to mail your payments to the address shown on your statement. You will be charged a late charge if a minimum payment is not made before the 29th day of any calendar month in which a payment is due. This late charge will be $15 if your Account balance is $250 or less, and $25 if your Account balance exceeds $250. If more than one (1) minimum payment is late in a six month period, an additional $10 will be added to the late charge.  In this case the late charge will be $25 if your Account balance is $250 or less, and $35 if your Account balance exceeds $250. In no case will the late charge exceed your minimum payment. If any check or any instrument given for payment on the Account is dishonored for any reason, a return payment fee in the amount of $10 will be imposed. Payments received in excess of your minimum payment amount on your Account will be applied to the balances with the highest APR unless the balance is part of a promotional offer where no interest is being charged. 
5. FINANCE CHARGES on Purchases/Debits. If you pay your entire balance for Purchases/Debits within 21 days of the date of the first statement showing such charges and any previous balances, no finance charges are incurred for such Purchases/Debits. If that balance is not paid in full within the required time, a finance charge will be added to your Purchases/Debits from the first day of the billing cycle following the purchase date until they are paid in full, calculated this way: We take the beginning balance of your Purchases/Debits each day, and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid finance charges attributable to the balance for Purchases/Debits. That gives us the daily balance for your Purchases/Debits. We then add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. We multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate times the number of days in the billing cycle. 
6. FINANCE CHARGES on Cash Advances. You will pay a FINANCE CHARGE on Cash Advances from the date the advance is made until the advance is paid in full, computed as follows: We take the beginning balance of your Cash Advances each day, add any new Cash Advances charged on that day, and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid finance charges attributable to the balance for Cash Advances. That gives us the daily balance for your Cash Advances. We then add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. We multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate times the number of days in the billing cycle. 
7. FINANCE CHARGES on Balance Transfers. You will pay a FINANCE CHARGE on Balance Transfers from the date the transfer is made until the Balance Transfer amount is paid in full, computed as follows: We take the beginning balance of your Balance Transfers each day, add any new Balance Transfers charged on that day, and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid finance charges attributable to the balance for Balance Transfers. That gives us the daily balance for your Balance Transfers. We then add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. We multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate times the number of days in the billing cycle. 
8. Transaction Fee FINANCE CHARGE on Cash Advances. You will pay a Cash Advance fee FINANCE CHARGE for each cash advance equal to 3.00% of the amount advanced, but in no event will the cash advance fee be less than $5. 
9. Periodic Rate for Purchases (Standard APR).

Any changes to the Index will be effective on the first day of the next billing cycle and will apply to new Purchases/Debits and to the outstanding balance of your Account. If the daily periodic rate (and corresponding APR) increases, the amount of the finance charge and the minimum payment due may increase. If The Wall Street Journal ceases publication, we will select a new index and notify you of the change.
10. Periodic Rate for Cash Advances. The daily periodic rate and corresponding APR for Cash Advances for each billing cycle will be the sum of (i) the Prime Interest Rate (�Index�) as quoted in the Money Rates Table of The Wall Street Journal on the 20th business day of the previous month and (ii) 13.74%, divided by 365 and rounded up to two decimal places, with a maximum APR of 25%. Any changes to the Index will be effective on the first day of the next billing cycle and will apply to new Cash Advances and to the outstanding Cash Advance balance of your Account. If the daily periodic rate (and corresponding APR) increases, the amount of the finance charge and the minimum payment due may increase. If The Wall Street Journal ceases publication, we will select a new index and notify you of the change.
11. Periodic Rate for Balance Transfers. The daily periodic rate for Balance Transfers for each billing cycle will be the Standard APR divided by 365. Your periodic rate for Balance Transfers is listed on 
Page 1 of your Account Details Disclosure. 
12. Interest Rate. Your initial interest rate is found on Page 1 of your Account Details Disclosure. 
13. Delinquency Rate.

Keep This Notice For Future Use 
This notice contains important information about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. 
Notify Us in Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill 
If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet at the address listed on your bill. Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. 
In your letter, give us the following information: 
(1) your name and account number; 
(2) the dollar amount of the suspected error; and 
(3) describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.

Your Rights and Our Responsibilities After We Receive Your Written Notice 
We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill was correct. 
After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for the amount you question, including finance charges, and we can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. 
If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due. 
If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within ten days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. And we must tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is. 
If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct. 

Special Rule for Credit Card Purchases 
If you have a problem with the quality of property or services that you purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or services. There are two limitations on this right: 
(1) you must have made the purchase in your home state or, if not within your home state, within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and 
(2) the purchase price must have been more than $50. 
These limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or services.

DELTA COMMUNITY GOLD VISA
CONSUMER CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT In this Agreement, �Agreement� means this Consumer Credit Card Agreement. �Disclosure� means the Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement.
1.	USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor.
You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. 
2.	USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery tickets, and casino gaming chips, as applicable. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal.
3.	PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account.
4.	PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement. 
5.	FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later.
The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 
For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To get the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. Then, we add all the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances.
6.	FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date.
A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates.
7.	FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
a.	Cash Advance Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Cash Advance Fee (finance charge), the fee may be charged for ATM withdrawals and transfers made from your card to any deposit account through Online Banking and Audio Line.  Overdraft transfers are excluded.  A cash advance fee may be initially charged for balance transfers initiated to pay off non-Delta Community Credit Union accounts but will be credited back to your Visa account. 
b.	Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency. 
c.	Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
d.	Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when a payment is returned to you for any reason.
e.	Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the credit union, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request.
f.	Document Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Document Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request (except when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union).
g.	Rush Fee. If your account is subject to a Rush Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each rush card that you request, providing delivery of the card is also available by standard mail service, without paying a fee for delivery.
h.	Stop Payment Fee. If your account is subject to the Stop Payment Fee, a fee will be charged to your account as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
i.	Visa Convenience Checks Fee. If your account is subject to the Visa Convenience Checks Fee, a fee will be charged to your account as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
j.	Over-the-Credit Limit Fee. If you have elected the feature to allow your account to go over your credit limit, we may charge you a fee as allowed by law. However, in no case will we impose an over-the-limit fee except in the next two billing cycles unless you have obtained an additional extension of credit in excess of such credit limit during each subsequent cycle or you have reduced the balance below the credit limit as of the end of each bill cycle.
8.	PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 3.00% of your total new balance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, and any amount you are over your credit limit. In addition to the minimum payment, you must also pay, by the date specified above, the amount of any prior minimum payment(s) that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. 
9.	PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate. 
10.	SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. 
Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default.
Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement. 
11.	DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe.
When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe.
12.	LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION � You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at 1025 Virginia Ave, Atlanta GA 30354 or telephone 800-544-3328 seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.
13.	CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT � As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions.
Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized.
The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account. 
14.	CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS � Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user. If you cannot return the authorized user's card or access checks and if you request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for a new account.
15.	CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION � You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. If your account is eligible for emergency cash and/or emergency card replacement services, and you request such services, you agree that we may provide personal information about you and your account that is necessary to provide you with the requested service(s).
16.	RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS � Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6) months.
17.	ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS � The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit Union is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.
18.	MERCHANT DISPUTES � The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home.
19.	JOINT ACCOUNTS � If this is a joint account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may terminate the account and the termination will be effective as to all of you.
20.	EFFECT OF AGREEMENT � This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.
21.	NO WAIVER � The Credit Union can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.
22.	STATEMENTS AND NOTICES � Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the appropriate address you have given the Credit Union. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all. 
23.	SEVERABILITY AND FINAL EXPRESSION � This Agreement and the Disclosure are the final expression of the terms and conditions of your account. This written Agreement and Disclosure may not be contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement
If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:
Delta Community Credit Union
1025 Virginia Ave
Atlanta, GA 30354-1319
You may also contact us on the Web: www.deltacommunitycu.com
In your letter, give us the following information:
* Account information: Your name and account number.
* Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
* Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us:
* Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
* At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
	1.	Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
	2.	Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. 
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
* We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
* The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
* While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
* We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
* If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
* If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. 
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.

Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
	1.	The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
	2.	You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
	3.	You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing [or electronically] at:
Delta Community Credit Union
1025 Virginia Ave
Atlanta, GA 30354-1319
www.deltacommunitycu.com
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

For example, you are responsible for charges made by yourself, authorized users you designate, your spouse and minor children. You are also responsible for charges made by anyone else to whom you give the card and this responsibility continues until the card is recovered. You cannot disclaim responsibility by notifying us, but we will close the account for new transactions if you so request in writing and return all cards. Your obligation to pay the account balance continues even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which we are not a party may direct you or one of the other persons responsible to pay the account. Each of you who has signed the application is individually and jointly obligated for all payments due under this agreement. You agree to use
this Account only for personal, family, household or charitable purchases. You will not use this Account for any illegal transactions.

You agree not to let the account balance exceed this approved credit line. Each payment you make on the account will restore your credit limit by the amount of the payment applied to principal. You may request an increase in the amount of your credit line by written application or oral communication to us. It must be approved by our loan office. We may increase the amount of your credit line at our option. By giving you written notice, we may reduce your credit line from time to time, or with good cause, revoke your card and terminate this agreement. Good cause includes your
failure to comply with the agreement, or our adverse re-evaluation of your credit worthiness.

CREDIT INFORMATION: You authorize us to investigate your credit standing when opening, renewing or reviewing your account, and you authorize us to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and other creditors who inquire of us about your credit standing to the extent authorized in our bylaws.
6. MONTHLY PAYMENT: We will mail you a statement every month showing your previous balance of purchases and cash advances, the current transactions to your account, the remaining credit available under your credit line, the new balances of purchases and cash advances, the total new balance, the FINANCE CHARGE due to date and the minimum payment required. Every month you must pay at least the minimum payment within 25 days of your statement closing date. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment required or pay the total new balance in full and you will reduce the FINANCE CHARGE by doing so. The minimum payment will be either:
(a) 2.5% of your total new balance or $20, whichever is greater; or
(b) Your total new balance if it is less than $20 plus any portion of the minimum payment shown on prior statements that remains unpaid.
In addition, at any time your total new balance exceeds your credit line, you must immediately pay the excess upon our demand. We will apply your payments first to balances with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to other balances in descending order based on the applicable annual percentage rate. However, if you pay by check, the amount of your payment may not be applied to your available credit line for such period of time as we reasonably determine is necessary to ensure that your check is honored. We may also allow you to skip a payment. If we do, we will notify you in advance of this option. If you choose to skip a payment when offered, we will continue to assess FINANCE CHARGES. You agree to pay us in U.S. dollars drawn on funds on deposit in the United States using a payment check, similar instrument, or automatic debit that will be processed and honored by your financial institution. We reserve the right to accept payments made in foreign currency. If we do, we will select the currency conversion rate at our discretion.
7. IRREGULAR PAYMENTS: We reserve the right to accept late payments or check and money orders marked �payment in full� without any prejudice to our rights under this agreement.  If a check is presented for payment before the date you write on the check or the check is not dated, SECU has the right to process the check for payment or return it unpaid. You will hold SECU harmless for any action in payment or non-payment of the check.
8. FINANCE CHARGES: Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing cycle.  We will not charge you any interest on purchases if you pay your entire balance by 
the due date each month. If you do not pay the total new balance for purchases by the due date, FINANCE CHARGES will be imposed on the unpaid purchase balance from the first date of the  last billing cycle and on new purchases from the day they are posted to your account. For cash advances and balance transfers, FINANCE CHARGES will begin to accrue from the date of the transaction and continue to accrue until payment in full is credited to your account. Separate average or daily balances are calculated for purchases and cash advances. The FINANCE CHARGE is calculated by multiplying the average daily balances by a monthly periodic rate of 0.87 which is an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 10.49%. To get the ""average daily balance"" for purchases we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any  payments or credits, and unpaid finance charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle 
and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance."" To get the daily balance for cash advances, new cash advances are added to 
the day�s beginning balance and payments and credits are subtracted. Fees are not included in the calculation of the average daily balance. FINANCE CHARGES will continue to
accrue on your account until what you owe under this agreement is paid in full. 
9. LATE CHARGE: In addition to the continued accrual of the FINANCE CHARGE at the daily periodic rate, if you fail to pay at least the minimum payment within 15 days after it is due, we may assess a late charge of $25.00 for each delinquent payment.
10. THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ANY OTHER CHARGES MAY BE IMPOSED: These charges will be added to your purchase balance:
(a) DISHONORED CHECK - A $15.00 fee may be imposed if payment is made with a check that is dishonored on the second presentment.
(b) RESEARCH CHARGE - A $6.00 fee will be charged to your account if you request a copy of a sales� or cash advance draft that is not part of a chargeback or fraud claim. This fee will also apply to each statement request.
(c) ADDITIONAL CARDS - We will issue up to four (4) cards at no cost. Rush requests are $25.00 per request.
 11. DEFAULT: You will be in default if you fail to make a minimum payment within 25 days after your monthly statement closing date. You will be in default if you break any promise you made or any security agreement made in connection with an advance. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy, or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or update of credit information. You will also be in default if something happens that SECU believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. When you are in default SECU can demand immediate payment of the entire amount you owe without giving you advance notice. You will also be required to pay our collection expenses, including court costs and an additional sum equal to 20% of the aggregate of the principal and interest due if your account is referred to an attorney at law or to a collection agency for collection. You authorize us to submit payroll deduction requests, when available, from your wages, salary or pension to the State of Maryland or other employee agency for any amounts in default without additional authorization.
12. DELAY IN ENFORCEMENT: We can delay enforcing any right under this Agreement without losing that right or any other right.
13. SEVERABILITY: If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, all provisions that are severable from the invalid provision remain in effect.
14. ACCESSING THE ACCOUNT: To make a purchase or cash advance there are three alternatives:
(a) Present the card to a participating VISA� plan merchant, to us or to another financial institution. Then sign the sales or cash advance draft that has been imprinted with your card information.
(b) Complete the transaction by using your Personal Identification Number (PIN) in conjunction with the card in an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) or other type of electronic terminal that provides access to the VISA system.
(c) Issue a convenience check for the payment of goods, services or cash. Sales, cash advance checks, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. You will retain the copy of such slips furnished at the time of the transaction to verify the monthly statement. State Employees Credit Union of Maryland, Inc. (SECU) may charge a reasonable fee for photocopies of slips you request.
15. CARD RENEWAL: Cards are issued with an expiration date. We have the right
not to renew your card for any reason.
16. RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS: Merchants and others who honor the card
may give credit for returns or adjustments and they will do so by sending us a credit
slip which we will post to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what
you owe us, we will hold and apply this credit balance against future purchases and
and cash advances, or if $1.00 or more, refund it on your written request or automatically
after 6 months.
17. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS: Purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. Up to a 1% International Transaction Fee will be assessed on all transactions where the merchant country differs from the country of the card issuer. The converted transaction will be shown separately from the international Transaction Fee on your billing statement. This fee will be assessed on all international purchases, credit vouchers, and cash disbursements. The exchange rate for transactions in foreign currency will be a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or the government mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date plus up to a 1% International Transaction Fee.
18. PLAN MERCHANT DISPUTES: We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor your card. We are subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) as set forth herein under, �Special Rules For Credit Card Purchases.� You must resolve any other disputes directly with the plan merchant. We may limit the dollar amount and/or the number of transactions which may be approved in one day. If we detect unusual or suspicious activity on your account, we may temporarily suspend your credit privileges until we can verify the activity. We may approve transactions which cause the balance to exceed your credit line without waiving any of our rights to this Agreement.
19. SECURITY INTEREST: You give the share and deposit accounts listed herein as Security for this Agreement. By signing the Security Agreement attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, you give us a security interest called a pledge in all shares and deposits shown on the Security Agreement. If you are in default, we can take money from your shares or deposits to make any payments that are past due as well as any late charges.

You have a given Consensual Security Interest, incorporated by reference herein, in your SECU Savings or Money Manager account, as security for any advances to you or on your behalf on any SECU VISA� Credit Card, excepting those accounts that have an adverse tax consequence.


20. CASH ADVANCES: Cash advances can be obtained through an ATM, convenience checks, SECU branches and other financial institutions. Upon your written direction, or through SECU�s website, cash advances, including ATM, transfer and convenience checks, may be made against your VISA account and applied to any of your SECU accounts, or other accounts in the same manner as if the cash advance were paid to you. Deposit of the cash advance to any of your SECU accounts obligates you to repayment of the cash advance per the terms of this Agreement.
21. BALANCE TRANSFER(S): Balance Transfers are treated as a cash advance. Finance charges for balance transfers will begin to accrue from date of the transaction and continue to accrue until payment in full is credited to your account. Total value of transfer request(s) cannot exceed credit line and/or credit availability whichever is less. SECU sends either full or partial payment to your creditors in the order you list them. Allow at least 2 weeks from request date
for processing of the balance transfer. Continue paying each creditor until the transfer appears as a credit. Do not transfer any disputed purchase or other charge because you may lose your dispute right.
22. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT: This Agreement is the contract that applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms. We may amend this Agreement from time to time by sending you the advance written notice required by Federal and State law. Your use of the card thereafter will indicate your agreement to the amendments.  
23. GOVERNING LAW: This Agreement is governed by the Annotated Code of Maryland, Financial Institutions Article, Title 6 and the Annotated Code of Maryland, Commercial Law Article, Title 12, Subtitle 9 and applicable federal law or regulation.
24. VISA STATEMENTS AND NOTICES: On a regular basis, you will receive a statement showing all transactions for this account during the period covered by the statement. Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the most recent address you have given SECU in writing. Notice to any one of you will be notice to all.
25. UPDATING INFORMATION: You promise that you will promptly give SECU written notice if you move, change your name or employment, or if any other information you provide to SECU changes. You also agree to provide SECU with updated financial information about yourself upon request.
26. COPY RECEIVED: By signing, using or accepting the SECU VISA card, you acknowledge receipt of this Agreement and agree to the terms herein.
27. STOP PAYMENT: If before a Transfer or Convenience Check drawn on your Account has been honored, you notify us not to pay it, we will stop payment on the check. You must send us a written and signed stop payment order which states the number, payee, amount and date of the check on which payment is to be stopped. We may disregard any such order six months after our receipt unless you renew it in writing.
28. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT: You can cancel or close your Account by writing to us at SECU, 971 Corporate Blvd., Linthicum, MD 21090. Your notice becomes effective within five days after we receive it. If you cancel your Account, you must pay everything you owe us, including any amounts owed but not yet billed to you. If you do not pay us immediately, outstanding balances will continue to accrue FINANCE CHARGES and other charges and be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You also agree to return your card(s) and any unused Transfer and/or Convenience Checks to us.

CARD AGREEMENT 


This Card Agreement is your contract with us. It governs 
the use of your card and account. The Supplemental Pricing 
Information (�Supplement�) is part of this Agreement. Please 
read this Agreement, including the Supplement, carefully. 
Keep both for your records. 

Definitions 

account means the relationship established between you and 
us by this Agreement. 


APR means an annual percentage rate. 
authorized user means any person you allow to use your 
account. 


card means one or more cards or other access devices that 
we give you to get credit under this Agreement. This includes 
account numbers. 


we, us, and our mean Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., the 

issuer of your account. 
you, your, and yours mean the person who applied to open 
the account. It also means any other person responsible for 
complying with this Agreement. 


Your Account 

You agree to use your account in accordance with this 
Agreement. You must pay us for all amounts due on your 
account. This Agreement is binding on you unless you close 
your account within 30 days after receiving the card and you 
have not used or authorized use of the card. Your account 
must only be used for lawful transactions. 

Authorized Users. You may request additional cards for authorized 
users. Each authorized user is your agent and may use, 
manage, and receive information about the account to the 
same extent as you, subject to any limitations we may impose. 
You must pay us for all charges made by authorized users. 
You must pay us even if you did not intend to be responsible 
for those charges. You must notify us to withdraw any permission 
you give to an authorized user to use your account. 

Joint Accounts. If this is a joint account, each of you is 
responsible individually and together for all amounts owed. 
Each of you is responsible even if the account is used by 
only one of you. You will continue to be liable for the entire 
balance of the account, even if your co-applicant is ordered 
by a court to pay us. You will remain liable to us if your coapplicant 
fails to pay as ordered by the court. Your account 
status will continue to be reported to the credit bureau under 

each of your names. The delivery of notices or billing statements 
to either of you serves as delivery to each of you. We 
may rely on instructions given by either of you. We are not 
liable to either of you for relying upon such instructions. 

Credit Limit. Your initial credit limit is on the card carrier. 
After that, your credit limit appears on your billing statement. 
The full amount of your credit limit is available to use where 
the card is honored. We will notify you separately if your 
account has a cash advance feature. If it does, part of your 
credit limit is called the cash advance limit. It is available for 
cash advances. If your account does not have a cash advance 
feature, the terms of this Agreement relating to cash advances 
do not apply to your account. We may reduce or increase 
your credit limit or cash advance limit at any time for any 
reason, as permitted by law. We will notify you of any change, 
but the change may take effect before you receive the notice. 
You should always keep your total balance below the credit 
limit. However, if the total balance goes over your credit limit 
you still must pay us. If your account has a credit balance, we 
may reduce the credit balance by any new charges on your 
account. You may not maintain a credit balance in excess of 
your credit limit. 

Checks. We may provide you with convenience checks. When 
we do, we will tell you in writing whether they may be used 
for balance transfer transactions or cash advance transactions. 
If we tell you they may be used for balance transfer 
transactions, any use will be a balance transfer transaction. 
You may use them to transfer a balance to your account or 
make other transactions. If we tell you they may be used for 
cash advance transactions, any use will be a cash advance 
transaction even if you use the check to make a payment to 
another creditor. You may not use convenience checks to 
pay an amount owed to us under this Agreement or to pay 
another account with us or an affiliate. We do not certify 
these checks or return any checks that have been paid. 

Billing Statement. Your billing statement shows the New 
Balance. This is the total amount you owe us on the Statement 
Closing Date. To determine the New Balance, we begin 
with the total balance at the start of the billing cycle. We 
add any purchases, balance transfers or cash advances. We 
subtract any credits or payments. We then add any interest 
charges or fees and make other adjustments. 

Your billing statement also shows your transactions; the Minimum 
Payment Due and payment due date; your credit limit 
and cash advance limit; and your interest charges and fees. 

We deliver a billing statement to only one address. You must 
notify Customer Service of a change in address. We may stop 

sending you statements if we deem your account uncollectible 
or start collection proceedings; but we may continue to 
add interest and fees as permitted by law. 

APRs 

Variable APRs Based on Prime. See the Supplement for 
information about the APRs that apply to your account. 
If any APR is based on the U.S. Prime Rate (�Prime Rate�), 
the APR will equal the Prime Rate plus an additional amount. 
The additional amount appears on the Supplement. If the 
Prime Rate increases, it will cause the APR to increase. If the 
Prime Rate decreases, it will cause the APR to decrease. For 
each billing cycle we use the Prime Rate published in The 
Wall Street Journal two business days before the Statement 
Closing Date. If the Prime Rate causes an APR to change, we 
put the new APR into effect as of the first day of the billing 
cycle for which we calculate the APR. We apply the new APR 
to any existing balances, subject to any promotional rate that 
may apply. If The Wall Street Journal does not publish the 
Prime Rate, we will use a similar published rate. 

Effect of APR Increases. If an APR increases, interest charges 
increase. Your minimum payment may increase as well. 

Promotions 

We may offer promotional terms for all or a part of any 
balances. Any promotional terms may apply for a limited 
period of time. They will be governed by the terms of the 
promotional offer and this Agreement. Your promotional 
terms will end when the promotional period expires or, to 
the extent permitted by law, if you make a late payment. 
The promotional offer will tell you if we require a separate 
minimum payment on the promotional balance. 

If a promotional offer is a deferred interest offer, no interest 
charges will be imposed on the deferred interest balance 
if you pay the balance in full by the end of the promotional 
period for that deferred interest balance. We will impose 
interest charges on the deferred interest balance at the APR 
for regular purchases from the date of purchase if you do not 
pay the balance in full by the end of the promotional period. 

Interest Charges Based on APRs 
Interest Charges. We impose interest charges when we 
apply APRs to your account balances. We do this every day 
by using a daily periodic rate. To get a daily periodic rate, 
we divide the APR by 365. 

When Interest Charges Begin. We begin to impose interest 
charges the first day we add a charge to a daily balance. The 
charges we add to a daily balance include purchases, balance 
transfers, and cash advances. They also include interest 

charges and fees. We continue to impose interest charges 
until we credit your account with full payment of the total 
amount you owe us. 

Grace Period on Purchases. You can avoid interest 
charges on purchases, but not on balance transfers and 
cash advances. This is called a grace period on purchases. 
The grace period is at least 25 days. To get a grace period 
on purchases, you must pay the New Balance by the payment 
due date every billing cycle. If you do not, you will not get a 
grace period until you pay the New Balance for two billing 
cycles in a row. 

If you have a balance subject to a deferred interest promotion 
and that promotion does not expire before the payment due 
date, that balance (the �excluded promotional balance�) is 
excluded from the amount you must pay in full to get a grace 
period. However, you must still pay any separately required 
payment on the excluded promotional balance. In billing 
cycles in which payments are allocated to deferred interest 
balances first, the deferred interest balance will be reduced 
before any other balance on the account. However, you will 
continue to get a grace period on purchases so long as you 
pay the New Balance less any excluded promotional balances 
in full by the payment due date each billing cycle. 

In addition, certain promotional offers may take away the 
grace period on purchases. Other promotional offers not 
described above may also allow you to have a grace period 
on purchases without having to pay all or a portion of the 
promotional balance by the payment due date. If either is the 
case, the promotional offer will describe what happens. 

Calculation of Interest Charges � Daily Balance Method 
(Including Current Transactions). We calculate interest 
charges each billing cycle. To do this: 

� We start with each of your different balances. These 
balances include, for example, regular purchases, Old 
Balances, regular cash advances, and different promotional 
balances. (When we calculate interest charges, 
we treat each deferred interest transaction separately 
even if it has the same terms as another deferred interest 
transaction and we treat balance transfers as regular 
purchases unless a promotional rate applies.) 
� We calculate the daily balance for each of your different 
balances. To get a daily balance, we start with the 
balance as of the end of the previous day. We add any 
interest charge on the previous day�s balance. (This 
results in daily compounding of interest charges.) We 
add any new charges. We then subtract any new credits 
or payments. 
� We multiply each daily balance by the daily periodic rate 
that applies to it. We do this for each day in the billing 

cycle. This gives us the daily interest charges for each 

of your different balances. 

� We add up all the daily interest charges. The sum is the 
total interest charge for the billing cycle. 
� You authorize us to round interest charges to the nearest 
cent. 
When we calculate daily balances, we add a purchase, 
balance transfer, or cash advance as of the Transaction Date. 
(The Transaction Date for a balance transfer or cash advance 
is the date we get a request to complete a transaction. When 
you send a convenience check directly to someone, the Transaction 
Date is the date we receive the check for payment. 
The Transaction Date is on the billing statement.) We add a 
transaction fee to the same balance as the transaction. We 
generally add other fees, including credit protection fees and 
insurance charges, to the regular purchase balance. We add 
any remaining balance from a balance transfer at a promotional 
APR to the regular purchase balance. We do this on 
the day after the promotional period expires. We subtract a 
payment or credit as of the day it is credited to the account 
and then make other adjustments. We treat a credit balance 
as a balance of zero. 

Minimum Interest Charge. If we charge you interest, the 
charge will be no less than $2. We add the charge to the 
regular purchase balance or allocate it among one or more 
of the balances that accrues interest. 

Balance Subject to Interest Rate. Your statement shows 
a Balance Subject to Interest Rate. It shows this for each 
different balance. The Balance Subject to Interest Rate is the 
average of the daily balances during the billing cycle. A billing 
cycle begins on the day after the Statement Closing Date of 
the previous billing cycle. It includes the Statement Closing 
Date of the current billing cycle. 

Fees 

Annual Membership Fee. If an annual membership fee 
applies, the Supplement shows it. We will refund this fee if 
you notify us that you are closing your account within 30 
days of the mailing or delivery date of the billing statement on 
which the fee appears. The fee is otherwise non-refundable. 
If this fee applies, we add it to the regular purchase balance. 

Transaction Fee for Cash Advances. You take a cash advance 
if you use a cash advance convenience check; get money 
through an automated teller machine (ATM); or get money 
through home banking or a financial institution. You also take 
a cash advance if you make a wire transfer; buy a money 
order, traveler�s check, lottery ticket, casino chip, or similar 

item; or engage in a similar transaction. For each cash 
advance we add a transaction fee of 5% of the amount of 
the cash advance, but not less than $5. 

Transaction Fee for Balance Transfers. You make a balance 
transfer if you use a balance transfer convenience check or 
contact us to transfer a balance. For each balance transfer 
we add a transaction fee of 5% of the amount of the balance 
transfer, but not less than $10. This fee is in addition to any 
periodic fee that may be imposed with a promotional offer. 

Transaction Fee for Foreign Purchases. We add a transaction 
fee of 3% of the U.S. dollar amount of each purchase 
made outside the U.S., whether made in U.S. dollars or in a 
foreign currency. 

Late Fee. We may add a late fee for each billing cycle in 
which you have a past due payment. For late fee purposes, 
you have a past due payment any time you fail to pay the 
Minimum Payment Due (less the Amount Over Credit Limit 
shown on your billing statement) by the payment due date. 
The fee will be $25; or $35 for any additional past due 
payment during the next six billing cycles after a past due 
payment. However, the fee will not exceed the amount permitted 
by law. We add this fee to the regular purchase balance. 

Returned Payment Fee. We may add a returned payment fee 
for a returned payment. A returned payment is an electronic 
debit, payment check, or similar payment instrument, that is 
returned unpaid. We may add this fee the first time your payment 
is returned, even if it is not returned upon resubmission. 
The fee will be $25; or $35 for any additional returned 
payment during the next six billing cycles after a returned 
payment. However, the fee will not exceed the amount permitted 
by law. We add this fee to the regular purchase balance. 

Returned Convenience Check Fee. We may add a returned 
convenience check fee for a returned convenience check. 
A returned convenience check is any convenience check we 
do not honor. We may not honor these checks if the amount 
of the check would cause the balance to go over the cash 
advance limit or credit limit. We also may not honor these 
checks if you default; if you did not comply with our instructions 
regarding the check; if your account has been closed; or 
for other reasons. The fee will be $25; or $35 for any returned 
convenience check during the next six billing cycles after a 
returned convenience check. However, the fee will not exceed 
the amount permitted by law. We add this fee to the regular 
purchase balance. 

Stop Payment on Convenience Check Fee. We add a $39 fee 
if we honor your request to stop payment on a convenience 
check. Write us at P.O. Box 6275, Sioux Falls, SD 57117 to 

stop payment on a convenience check. You can also call the 
Customer Service number on the billing statement. If you call, 
you must confirm the call in writing within 14 days. A written 
stop payment order is good for 6 months unless renewed in 
writing. We add this fee to the regular purchase balance. 

Information on Foreign Currency Conversion 
Our network provider is MasterCard. MasterCard converts 
transactions in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. MasterCard 
follows its own procedures to do so. These may change from 
time to time without notice. Currently, MasterCard uses a 
conversion rate in effect one day before its transaction processing 
date. It uses a government-mandated rate if required 
to do so. If not, it uses a wholesale market rate. A third party 
may convert a transaction into U.S. dollars or another currency 
before sending it to MasterCard. In these cases, the 
third party selects the conversion rate. In all cases, the conversion 
rate you get is the one used on the transaction�s 
processing date. This may be different from the one in effect 
on the Transaction Date or post date for the transaction. 

Payments 
Minimum Payment Due. You must pay at least the Minimum 
Payment Due by the payment due date each billing cycle. The 
sooner you pay the New Balance, the less you will pay in 
interest charges. 

To calculate the Minimum Payment Due, we begin with any 
past due amount. We add any amount in excess of your credit 
limit. We then add any additional amount specified in a promotional 
offer. We also add the largest of the following: 

� The Calculated New Balance if it is less than $25; 
� $25 if the Calculated New Balance is at least $25; 
� 1% of the Calculated New Balance (the result is rounded 
up to the nearest dollar) plus the amount of your billed 
interest charges on that balance, any minimum interest 
charge allocated to that balance, and any applicable late 
fee. However, we subtract interest charges that accrued 
during prior billing cycles on a deferred interest balance 
that ended during the billing cycle covered by the statement; 
or 
� 1.5% of the Calculated New Balance (the result is 
rounded up to the nearest dollar). 
The Calculated New Balance equals the New Balance on the 
billing statement less any balances subject to either of two 
types of promotional terms. The first type are terms that do 
not require a minimum payment. The second type are terms 
that require an additional amount as part of the Minimum 
Payment Due. The Minimum Payment Due may reflect 
adjustments to the New Balance and is never more than the 

Calculated New Balance plus any additional amount required 

by a promotional offer. 
Application of Payments. Payments in excess of the Minimum 
Payment Due are applied in accordance with law. This 
means that we will generally apply payments in excess of the 
Minimum Payment Due to higher APR balances first. However, 
excess payments received before a deferred interest 
promotion expires are applied to the deferred interest 
promotional balance first in the last two billing cycles of the 
promotional period. And, if the expiration date of a deferred 
interest promotion is before the payment due date in the 
billing cycle in which the deferred interest promotion expires, 
excess payments received before the deferred interest promotion 
expires are applied to the deferred interest promotional 
balance first in the last three billing cycles of the promotional 
period. Payments equal to or less than the Minimum Payment 
Due and credits are applied at our discretion and you 
authorize us to apply payments and credits in a way that 
is most favorable or convenient for us. This may include 
applying such payments and credits to lower APR balances 
first and to balances with longer promotional periods first. 

Payment Instructions. We credit your payments in accordance 
with our payment instructions on the billing statement. 
You must pay us in U.S. dollars. To do so, you must use a 
check, similar instrument, or electronic debit that is drawn on 
and honored by a bank in the U.S. Do not send cash. We can 
accept late or partial payments, or payments that reflect �paid 
in full� or other restrictive endorsements, without losing our 
rights. We also reserve the right to accept payments made in 
foreign currency and instruments drawn on funds on deposit 
outside the U.S. If we do, we select the currency conversion 
rate. We will then credit your account in U.S. dollars after 
deducting any costs incurred in processing your payment. 
Or we may bill you separately for these costs. 

Optional Pay by Phone Service. You may use our optional 
Pay by Phone Service to make your payment by phone. To do 
so, call us to request the service. You agree to pay us the Pay 
by Phone fee shown in the Pay by Phone section on the back 
of the billing statement when a representative of ours helps 
expedite your payment. Our representatives are trained to tell 
you this amount when you use this service. 

Credit Reporting 
We may report information about your account to credit 
bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults 
on your account may be reflected in your credit report. We 
may report account information in your name and the names 
of authorized users. We may also obtain follow-up credit 
reports on you. 

If you think we reported incorrect information to a credit 
bureau, write us at the Customer Service address on the billing 
statement. We will investigate the matter. We will then tell you 
if we agree or disagree with you. If we agree with you, we will 
contact each credit bureau to which we reported and request 
a correction. If we disagree with you, we will tell you that. 

Information Sharing 
You authorize us to share information about you as permitted 
by law. This includes information we get from you and others. 
It also includes information about your transactions with us. 
Please see our Privacy Notice for details about our information 
sharing practices. 

Changes to this Agreement 
We may change the rates, fees, and terms of this Agreement 
from time to time as permitted by law. The changes 
may add, replace, or remove provisions of this Agreement. 
We will give you advance written notice of the changes and 
a right to opt out to the extent required by law. 

Default 
You default under this Agreement if you fail to pay the 
Minimum Payment Due by its due date; go over your credit 
limit; pay by a check or similar instrument that is not honored 
or that we must return because it cannot be processed; pay 
by electronic debit that is returned unpaid; file for bankruptcy; 
or fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If you 
default, we may close your account and, to the extent permitted 
by law, demand immediate payment of the total balance. 

Refusal of the Card, Closed Accounts, 
and Related Provisions 

Refusal of the Card. We do not guarantee approval of 
transactions. We are not liable for transactions that are not 
approved. That is true even if you have enough credit. We 
may limit the number of transactions approved in one day. 
If we detect unusual or suspicious activity, we may suspend 
your credit privileges. 

Preauthorized Charges. We may suspend any automatic or 
other preauthorized card charges you arrange with a third 
party. We may do this if you default; if the card is lost or 
stolen; or we change your account for any reason. If we do 
this, you are responsible for paying the third party directly if 
you wish to do so. You are also responsible for reinstating the 
preauthorized charges if you wish to do so and we permit it. 

Lost or Stolen Cards, Account Numbers or Convenience 
Checks. You must call us if any card, account number, or 
check is lost or stolen. You must also call us if you think 
someone used or may use them without permission. When 


you call, we may require you to provide information to help 
our investigation. We may require you to provide this information 
in writing. For example, we may ask you to identify 
any charges that were not made by you or someone authorized 
by you. We may also ask you to confirm that you 
received no benefit from those charges. 

Closing Your Account. You may close your account by 
notifying us in writing or over the phone. If you close your 
account, you must still repay the total balance in accordance 
with this Agreement. We may also close your account or 
suspend account privileges at any time for any reason. We 
may do this without prior notice to you. We may also reissue 
a different card at any time. You must return any card to us 
upon request. 

ARBITRATION 
PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. 
IT PROVIDES THAT ANY DISPUTE MAY BE RESOLVED 
BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION REPLACES THE 
RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A 
JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION 
OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. IN ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE 
IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE 
OR JURY. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND 
MORE LIMITED THAN COURT PROCEDURES. 

Agreement to Arbitrate: Either you or we may, without the 
other�s consent, elect mandatory, binding arbitration for any 
claim, dispute, or controversy between you and us (called 
�Claims�). 

Claims Covered 

What Claims are subject to arbitration? All Claims relating 
to your account, a prior related account, or our relationship 
are subject to arbitration, including Claims regarding the 
application, enforceability, or interpretation of this Agreement 
and this arbitration provision. All Claims are subject to arbitration, 
no matter what legal theory they are based on or what 
remedy (damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief) they 
seek. This includes Claims based on contract, tort (including 
intentional tort), fraud, agency, your or our negligence, 
statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other sources of 
law; Claims made as counterclaims, cross-claims, third-
party claims, interpleaders or otherwise; and Claims made 
independently or with other claims. A party who initiates 
a proceeding in court may elect arbitration with respect to 
any Claim advanced in that proceeding by any other party. 
Claims and remedies sought as part of a class action, private 
attorney general or other representative action are subject to 
arbitration on an individual (non-class, non-representative) 

basis, and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individ


ual (non-class, non-representative) basis. 
Whose Claims are subject to arbitration? Not only ours and 
yours, but also Claims made by or against anyone connected 
with us or you or claiming through us or you, such as a 
co-applicant or authorized user of your account, an employee, 
agent, representative, affiliated company, predecessor or 
successor, heir, assignee, or trustee in bankruptcy. 

What time frame applies to Claims subject to arbitration? 

Claims arising in the past, present, or future, including Claims 
arising before the opening of your account, are subject to 
arbitration. 

Broadest interpretation. Any questions about whether Claims 
are subject to arbitration shall be resolved by interpreting this 
arbitration provision in the broadest way the law will allow it 
to be enforced. This arbitration provision is governed by the 
Federal Arbitration Act (the �FAA�). 

What about Claims filed in Small Claims Court? Claims filed 
in a small claims court are not subject to arbitration, so long 
as the matter remains in such court and advances only an 
individual (non-class, non-representative) Claim. 

What about debt collections? We and anyone to whom we 
assign your debt will not initiate an arbitration proceeding to 
collect a debt from you unless you assert a Claim against us 
or our assignee. We and any assignee may seek arbitration 
on an individual basis of any Claim asserted by you, whether 
in arbitration or any proceeding, including in a proceeding to 
collect a debt. You may seek arbitration on an individual basis 
of any Claim asserted against you, including in a proceeding 
to collect a debt. 

How Arbitration Works 

How does a party initiate arbitration? The party filing an 
arbitration must choose one of the following two arbitration 
firms and follow its rules and procedures for initiating and 
pursuing an arbitration: American Arbitration Association or 
JAMS. Any arbitration hearing that you attend will be held 
at a place chosen by the arbitration firm in the same city as 
the U.S. District Court closest to your then current billing 
address, or at some other place to which you and we agree in 
writing. You may obtain copies of the current rules of each of 
the arbitration firms and forms and instructions for initiating 
an arbitration by contacting them as follows: 

American Arbitration Association 
800-778-7879 (toll-free) 
Website: www.adr.org 


JAMS 
800-352-5267 (toll-free) 
Website: www.jamsadr.com 


At any time you or we may ask an appropriate court to 
compel arbitration of Claims, or to stay the litigation of Claims 
pending arbitration, even if such Claims are part of a lawsuit, 
unless a trial has begun or a final judgment has been entered. 
Even if a party fails to exercise these rights at any particular 
time, or in connection with any particular Claims, that party 
can still require arbitration at a later time or in connection 
with any other Claims. 

What procedures and law are applicable in arbitration? 

A single, neutral arbitrator will resolve Claims. The arbitrator 
will be either a lawyer with at least ten years experience or a 
retired or former judge, selected in accordance with the rules 
of the arbitration firm. The arbitration will follow procedures 
and rules of the arbitration firm in effect on the date the 
arbitration is filed unless those procedures and rules are 
inconsistent with this Agreement, in which case this Agreement 
will prevail. Those procedures and rules may limit the 
discovery available to you or us. The arbitrator will take 
reasonable steps to protect customer account information 
and other confidential information if requested to do so by 
you or us. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law 
consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, 
will honor claims of privilege recognized at law, and will have 
the power to award to a party any damages or other relief 
provided for under applicable law. You or we may choose to 
have a hearing and be represented by counsel. The arbitrator 
will make any award in writing and, if requested by you or us, 
will provide a brief statement of the reasons for the award. An 
award in arbitration shall determine the rights and obligations 
between the named parties only, and only in respect of the 
Claims in arbitration, and shall not have any bearing on the 
rights and obligations of any other person, or on the 
resolution of any other dispute. 

Who pays? Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing 
fee. If we file, we pay; if you file, you pay, unless you get a 
fee waiver under the applicable rules of the arbitration firm. 
If you have paid the initial filing fee and you prevail, we will 
reimburse you for that fee. If there is a hearing, we will pay 
any fees of the arbitrator and arbitration firm for the first day 
of that hearing. All other fees will be allocated as provided by 
the rules of the arbitration firm and applicable law. However, 
we will advance or reimburse your fees if the arbitration firm 
or arbitrator determines there is good reason for requiring 
us to do so, or if you ask us and we determine there is good 
reason for doing so. Each party will bear the expense of that 


party�s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, 
regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover 
any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, 
applying applicable law, so determines. 

Who can be a party? Claims must be brought in the name 
of an individual person or entity and must proceed on an 
individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitrator 
will not award relief for or against anyone who is not a 
party. If you or we require arbitration of a Claim, neither you, 
we, nor any other person may pursue the Claim in arbitration 
as a class action, private attorney general action or other 
representative action, nor may such Claim be pursue",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

4.  INTEREST CHARGE CALCULATION
If we have not received payment in full of the New Balance by the Payment Due Date shown on your periodic statement, we may assess an Interest Charge applied to the Average Daily Balance. We determine the Interest Charge on your Account by applying the periodic rate applicable to your state of residence as determined by your billing address to the Average Daily Balance of your Account. For an explanation of the calculation method used to determine the Interest Charge on your periodic statement, please call us toll free at our customer service number 1-800-428-4016. 
1. To get the Average Daily Balance we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases (new purchases are not included in computing the Average Daily Balance in the states of MA, ME, MN, MS, MT, NE, NM and RI), unpaid returned payment fees, and previously assessed unpaid Interest Charges and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add all the daily balances for the billing cycle together and divide by the total number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance.

2. If Interest Charges are imposed and the total Interest that results from application of the above calculation is less than $0.50, we will impose a Minimum Interest Charge of no less than $0.50 (which is a FINANCE CHARGE); except in AK, AR, CT, HI, ID, KY, MD, NC, ND, NE, NH, NM, NV, OR, and RI where there is no Minimum Interest Charge.

5.  HOW TO AVOID PAYING INTEREST ON PURCHASES
To avoid Interest Charges, payment of the New Balance must be received by the Payment Due Date shown on your periodic statement. Your Payment Due Date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any Interest on your Account if you pay your entire balance by the Payment Due Date each month.  You may at any time pay your total unpaid balance.

6.  OBTAINING CREDIT INFORMATION
SSA may investigate your credit history and obtain a consumer credit report from a consumer credit reporting agency in connection with your credit application or any subsequent update, renewal, or extension of credit. Upon your request, you will be informed whether or not SSA obtained such a report and if so the name and address of the agency that furnished the report. You agree that SSA may furnish information about your Account to the credit bureau and others who, in SSA's discretion, may receive such information.

7.  DEFAULT, COLLECTION COSTS, REPRINT FEES
If your Account is not paid according to terms, we reserve the right to demand immediate payment of the full amount outstanding on your Account, subject to applicable law. If your Account is referred to an attorney or collection agency, you agree to pay, in addition to the full amount owed, reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, or collector's fees, as allowed by applicable state law. 

We reserve the right to assess a reprint fee of up to $5 for administrative costs, for each reprint of statements and other documents, and for each ticket copy requested. Our failure or delay at any time to exercise any of our legal rights shall not be deemed a waiver of those rights or of the right to exercise its legal rights thereafter.

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
* If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
* If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at: Speedway SuperAmerica LLC, Attn: Credit Customer Service, PO Box 1590, Springfield, OH 45501.
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

Balance Computation Method

How We Will Calculate Your Balance:  We use a method called ""average daily balance (including new purchases)"" in all states except MA, ME, MN, MS, MT, NE, NM and RI; we use a method called ""average daily balance (excluding new purchases)"" in MA, ME, MN, MS, MT, NE, NM and RI. See below for more details. 
If we have not received payment in full of the New Balance by the Payment Due Date shown on your periodic statement, we may assess an Interest Charge applied to the Average Daily Balance. We determine the Interest Charge on your Account by applying the periodic rate applicable to your state of residence as determined by your billing address to the Average Daily Balance of your Account. For an explanation of the calculation method used to determine the Interest Charge on your periodic statement, please call us toll free at our customer service number 1-800-428-4016. 
1. To get the Average Daily Balance we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases (new purchases are not included in computing the Average Daily Balance in the states of MA, ME, MN, MS, MT, NE, NM and RI), unpaid returned payment fees, and previously assessed unpaid Interest Charges and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add all the daily balances for the billing cycle together and divide by the total number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance.

2. If Interest Charges are imposed and the total Interest that results from application of the above calculation is less than $0.50, we will impose a Minimum Interest Charge of no less than $0.50 (which is a FINANCE CHARGE); except in AK, AR, CT, HI, ID, KY, MD, NC, ND, NE, NH, NM, NV, OR, and RI where there is no Minimum Interest Charge.

                                          CREDIT CARD CONTRACT
                                    AND INITIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

Please read this Contract carefully. Your credit card account is governed by this Contract. In the Contract, ""Bank,"" ""we,""
""our"" and ""us"" refer to First National Bank (Ft. Pierre, SD) and we are the creditor named in the application you signed.
""You,"" ""your"" and ""applicant"" are the person(s) who applied to us for the Credit Account. ""Contract"" means the terms and
conditions outlined in this Contract that governs the use of your Credit Account and Card. ""Credit Account"" or ""Account""
means the credit card account we open for you, which is used to record transaction activity made by you when you access
or otherwise utilize the line of credit we extend to you. ""Credit Limit"" means the maximum amount of credit which may be
outstanding at any time on the Credit Account.
 1. Your Responsibility for the Account: You are responsible for the balance on the Account and you agree to pay the
       balance under the terms of this Contract. You need to sign the back of the Card. You need to protect and control the
       Card by not letting any other person use it. If you let another person use it, you agree to be responsible for any
       charges they make. We may permit you to add an Authorized User to your account. An Authorized User is any
       person you authorize to use the Card or your Account to obtain credit. If you add an Authorized User, you agree to pay
       for any charges they make as well as any related fees or interest. If you do not pay for the Authorized User charges,
       we may have rights to collect directly from them at our option. If you want to remove an Authorized User from your
       account, you need to get the card from them and notify us. If you cannot get the card, contact us immediately and we
       will close the account to try to stop further charges. The Cards remain our property and you agree to return them upon
       our request or we have the right to have a merchant keep the card and return it to us. If your card is lost or stolen or
       you suspect unauthorized use of your Account, you agree to notify us immediately.
 2. Using your Account to Obtain Credit: You can use the Card and your Account to make charges. We can close or
      suspend the account at any time for any reason. We also can limit the number or amount of charges you can make on
      the Account. You may be assigned a PIN (Personal Identification Number) or you may request a PIN to use ATM's to
      obtain Cash Advances. The minimum Cash Advance is $20.00 or more. Your Card and Account cannot be used for
      illegal charges.
 3. Your Credit Limit: The Credit Limit is printed on the Card Carrier and on your Statements. You may not exceed your
      Credit Limit at any time. If your balance is more than your Credit Limit, you must pay the amount over your Credit Limit
      immediately and we may suspend your account.
 4. Monthly Billing Statements: We will send you a statement every month with the account activity, fees and interest. It
      will also show your balance, interest, fees charged, minimum payment and payment due date.
 5. Payments: Payments should be sent to the address on the Payment Coupon with your billing statement. If you send a
      payment to any other address, there may be a delay in crediting it to your account. We do not lose any of our rights to
      collect the full balance if we accept late payments, partial payments or checks or money orders marked ""payment in
      full"" or similar language. Do not send us postdated checks. If you do, we may deposit them immediately and we will
      not have any liability. We will post payments upon receipt but your available credit may be limited for up to thirty (30)
      days. If your payment is returned unpaid from your bank, we may re-present it electronically. If this occurs, your check
      will not be sent to your bank but they can get a copy of it at your request.
 6. Minimum Payment: You may pay your entire balance at any time, without penalty. If there is a balance on your
      account, you must pay at least the Minimum Payment each month. The Monthly Minimum Payment is the greater of:
      $25.00; 2% of your balance; and is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. The Minimum Payment is your current
      Monthly Payment plus any past due Monthly Payments plus the amount your balance is over your Credit Limit. If your
      New Balance is less than $25.00, you must pay the full balance. Your payment must be received by the Payment Due
      Date. The Payment Due Date will be twenty-five (25) days from the Closing Date. The Closing Date is the last day of
      the billing cycle.
 7. Applying your Payments: In general, the payment will be applied in the following order: Unpaid Interest, Unpaid Fees
      and other Charges; and then principal balance. Payments applied to the principal balance will first be paid to balances
      at the highest Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and then to balances at lower APR's.
 8. Payment Methods: All payments must be made in U.S. dollars and drawn on a financial institution located in the
      United States. Do not send cash through the mail.

                                   AND INITIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

9. When Interest is Charged Interest will be charged on Purchases if you did not pay the previous balance in full by the
    Payment Due Date. For Cash Advances, Interest is imposed from the date the Cash Advance is made until it is paid in
    full and there is no way to avoid Interest. We will charge interest on the Average Daily Balance (including New
    Transactions). This balance is figured by adding the outstanding balance (including new transactions and deducting
    payments and credits) for each day in the billing cycle, and then dividing by the number of days in the billing cycle. We
    divide the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) by 12 months to determine the Monthly Rate. The Average Daily Balance
    (including New Purchases) multiplied by the Monthly Rate equals the Interest Amount.
10. Account Fees: You agree to pay us the following fees which will be billed to your account as a purchase and will
    accrue interest:
          a. Late Fee: You will be billed up to $25 if your payment is not received by your payment due date.
          b. Returned Payment Fee: You will be billed up to $25 if your payment is returned for any reason.
          c. Cash Advance Fee: You will be billed $5 or 2%, whichever is greater, for each cash advance
          d. Foreign Transaction: You will be billed 2% of each transaction in U.S. dollars.
11. Lost or Stolen Cards: If your Card is lost, stolen or being used without your permission, call us toll free (800) 423-
    7503, 24 hours a day. You should also write to us. Do not use the Card or Account after you have notified us. You will
    not be responsible for paying for any unauthorized use after you notify us of the loss, theft or unauthorized use.
12. If Card is Refused: We are not responsible, and have no liability if your Card or Account is not accepted for a charge.
    Although you may have the credit available, we may be unable to authorize credit due to system difficulties or
    mistakes.
13. Cardholder Privacy: We will send you a Privacy Notice annually. Your telephone calls with our representatives may
    be recorded for quality and other purposes. We may use automated telephone equipment or pre-recorded telephone
    calls to contact you at any number you provide to us or that we obtain, including any cellular telephone number. You
    agree that we will not be responsible for the release of information to anyone who has gained possession of a Card or
    Identification Number, Credit Account Number or Social Security Number.
14. Calls and Text Messages to Your Cellular Phone: If you provide us with your cellular phone number or contact us
    from your cellular phone, you are providing this phone number for us, our affiliates or any third party acting on our
    behalf to contact you at this number. You agree that we may use this phone number to contact you for any business
    purpose about your account and you agree to be responsible for any fees or charges you incur as a result of providing
    this information. You may request this number not be used. We may offer options for text messages or other
    electronic communications that may be received or accessed from your cellular phone and you agree that by enrolling

    Your name and account number; the dollar amount of the suspected error; a description of the problem. If you think

    us; 1) Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement and 2) If you have enrolled in automatic payment, at
    least 3 business days before the payment is scheduled if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.
    You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate
    any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
    When we receive your letter, we must do two things: Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that
    we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. Within 90 days of receiving your
    letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
    While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or
    report you as delinquent on that amount. The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue

                                      AND INITIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

      to charge you interest on that amount. While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for
      the remainder of your balance. We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
      After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the
      amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. If we do not believe there was a mistake: You
      will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the
      amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we
      think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days
      telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are
      questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let
      those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you
      do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.
      Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases: If you are dissatisfied with the goods or
      services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the
      merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the
      following must be true: 1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current
      mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: These limitations do not apply if your
      purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or
      services.) 2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an
      ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the
      purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at: First
      National Bank, PO Box 5097, Sioux Falls, SD 57117-5097. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed
      amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you
      owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.
16.   Delay in Enforcement: We can delay enforcing or fail to enforce any of our rights under this Contract without losing
      them.
17.   Credit Reports: You authorize us to obtain credit reports about you for any legitimate business purpose. We may
      obtain a credit report for reviewing, modifying the terms, renewing the account or collection. We may report information
      about your Account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your Account may be
      reflected in your credit report. You and each Authorized User agree that we may report account information to credit
      reporting agencies in the names of both you and the Authorized User.
18.   Change in Terms of your Credit Account: We may change any term of this Contract at any time upon such notice to
      you as is required by law. You may have the right to reject the change in terms, depending on the type of change, and
      if you do, your account will be closed and you will be able to pay off the balance under the terms in effect at that time.

            b. If you die or become legally incompetent;
            c. If you become insolvent or bankrupt;
            d. If you exceed or attempt to exceed your Credit Limit;
            e. If you provide us with or have provided us with false or misleading information or signatures at any time;
            f. If you fail to comply with this Contract;

VISA� CARD AGREEMENT & TRUTH-IN LENDING DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
In this Visa� Card Agreement and Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statement (�Agreement�), the words I, me, mine and my mean each and all of those who sign an application with the Credit Union for a Visa� credit card, and/or the person or persons who use or authorize the use of a Los Angeles Firemen�s Credit Union Visa� credit card. The words, you, your and yours mean Los Angeles Firemen�s Credit Union. Card means the Los Angeles Firemen�s Credit Union Classic Visa�, Student Visa� or Platinum Visa� credit card and any duplicates and renewals the Credit Union issues to me. Account means my Classic Visa�, Student Visa� or
Platinum Visa� credit card line of credit account with the Credit Union. Upon your credit approval, you will establish an open-end credit line for me.

VISA� CARD
Using the Account: If my application for a Visa� Account is approved, I agree not to let my Account balance exceed my Credit Limit. Each payment I make on the Account will restore my credit limit by the amount of the payment which is applied to the principal amount of purchases and cash advances.

Using the Card: I may use my Card to purchase goods and services in person and by mail, telephone or Internet* from merchants and others who accept Visa� credit cards. I may not use my card for any illegal transaction. In addition, I may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions participating in the Visa� program and from automated teller machines (ATMs), such as Visa� Network, that provide access to the Visa� system. (Not all ATMs provide such access.) I will need to use my Personal Identification Number (PIN) to obtain a cash advance from an ATM or other type of electronic terminal that provides access to the Visa� system. My Card and/or Account may not be used directly or indirectly for: (1) any illegal activity or transaction; or (2) any gambling, gaming, betting, or similar activity or transaction. Further, I may not utilize my Card and/or Account for the purchase of any goods or services on the Internet that involve gambling, gaming, betting, or any similar transaction or activity. Such transactions include, but may not be limited to, any quasicash or online gambling transaction, any electronic commerce transaction
conducted over an open network, and any betting transaction including the purchase of lottery tickets or casino gaming chips/checks or off-track betting or wagering. However, in the event that a charge or transaction described in this paragraph is approved and processed, I will still be responsible for such charges. *Verified by Visa� Requirement: To protect my Visa� Card against any
unauthorized online purchases, I will be required to register my Card in the Verified by Visa� program in order to make an online purchase with
any retailer that participates in the Verified by Visa� merchant program. If I do not register my Card in this program, I will not be able to make
the online purchase with the participating Verified by Visa� merchant. There is no fee to register my Card and, for my protection, you encourage
me to do so.

Change of Terms: Account and Agreement terms are not guaranteed for any period of time. I understand and agree that you may amend, modify, add to, or delete from this Agreement any of its terms and conditions, including financial terms such as the method of application and the amount of any INTEREST CHARGE, Transaction Fee, or other FINANCE CHARGE, ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, monthly periodic rate and/or fee in accordance with applicable laws. If required by applicable law, you will mail a notice of the change to me at my last known address. I also understand that in the event of a significant change, as defined under the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, any such notice will be mailed at least forty-five (45) days prior to the effective date of the significant change as required by applicable law. If you are required by applicable law to provide me a right to reject significant changes to this Agreement, you will provide me with an explanation of how to reject the significant changes, unless I fail to make a required
minimum payment within sixty (60) days after its due date. You may change the terms of this Agreement based on information in my credit report, market conditions, business strategy or for any other reason. Notice of a change in terms is required, but may be sent as late as the effective date of the change where the change has been agreed to in writing, by me.


For my Classic Visa�, Student Visa�, and Platinum Visa� Card Account the following Disclosures Apply:

Average Daily Balance (including current transactions): In order to avoid an INTEREST CHARGE on purchases made since my last statement  date, I must generally pay in full the New Balance shown on my last statement within 25 days of the statement closing date (this 25 day period is known as my �grace period�). Otherwise, an INTEREST CHARGE on purchases is calculated from the beginning of the next statement period on previously billed but unpaid purchases and on new purchases from the date they are posted to my Account. If I have a grace period to pay the New Balance for any billing cycle, and do not pay the New Balance in full during this grace period, INTEREST CHARGES will be assessed on any portion of the New Balance not paid during the grace period using the Average Daily Balance method as explained below. The Payment Due Date disclosed on each periodic statement
provided to me is the last day of my grace period for that statement�s billing cycle.

Cash advances are always subject to an INTEREST CHARGE from the date of the cash advance, or the first day of the billing cycle in which a cash advance is posted, whichever is later.

Separate average daily balances are calculated for purchases and cash advances. The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated by multiplying the average daily balances by the applicable monthly periodic rate. To get the average daily balance for purchases, you take the beginning purchase balance of my Account each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments or credits. This gives you the daily balance for purchases. Then, you add up all the daily balances for purchases during the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives you the �average daily balance� for purchases. To get the �average daily balance� for cash advances, you take the beginning cash advance balance of my Account each day, add any new cash advances, and subtract any payments or credits. This gives you the daily balance for cash advances. Then, you add up all the
daily balances for cash advances during the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This
gives you the �average daily balance� for cash advances.

New purchases are not subject to INTEREST CHARGES if I paid the New Balance for purchases on my last statement by the end of the grace period or if I did not have a purchase balance on my last statement. Fees are not included in the calculation of the average daily balance. INTEREST CHARGES will continue to accrue on my Account until what I owe under this Agreement is paid in full.
This determines my total periodic INTEREST CHARGES for the billing cycle. Actual periodic INTEREST CHARGES will be shown on my periodic statement.

For my Classic Visa� or Student Visa� Account the following Non-Variable Rate Disclosures apply:

INTEREST CHARGE: The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated by multiplying the average daily balances by a Monthly Periodic Rate of 1.166%, which is an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 13.99%.

For my Platinum Visa� Card Account the following Non-Variable Rate Disclosures apply:

INTEREST CHARGE: The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated by multiplying the average daily balances by a Monthly Periodic Rate of ________%, which is an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of ________%. 

Other Charges: The following other charges will be added to my Account, as applicable: LATE PAYMENT FEE*: Up to $15.00
RETURNED PAYMENT FEE: Up to $22.00 *If the minimum payment due is not received within 15 days after the due date.

Credit Information: I authorize the Credit Union to investigate my credit standing when opening or reviewing my Account. From time
to time you may request, and I agree to provide, current or additional information regarding my financial condition. I authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding my Account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about my credit standing. Pursuant to California state law, I am hereby notified that a negative credit report reflecting on my credit record may be submitted to a credit reporting agency if I fail to fulfill the terms of my credit obligations.

Minimum Monthly Payment: Each month I must pay at least the minimum payment shown on my statement within 25 days of the
statement closing date. I may, of course, pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment, or pay the Total New Balance
in full. If I make extra payments or larger payments, I am still required to make at least the minimum payment each month my
Account has a balance. The minimum payment required is the total New Balance as shown on my monthly billing statement if
the amount is under $25.00. If the New Balance exceeds $25.00 the minimum periodic payment is 2.50% of that portion of the
New Balance which does not exceed my credit limit, plus the entire portion of the New Balance in excess of my credit limit,
plus any amount past due, or $25.00, whichever is greater.

At any time my New Balance exceeds my Credit Limit, I must immediately pay the excess upon demand.

I understand and agree that any Minimum Monthly Payment made by me will be applied in the following order: (a) over limit
amount, if any; (b) unpaid fees and charges, if any; (c) unpaid periodic INTEREST CHARGES due on both purchases and cash
advances and other FINANCE CHARGES; (d) outstanding principal balances of cash advances and purchases previously billed;
and (e) current cash advances and purchases. If two or more transactions are posted on the same day, my payment will be
applied first to the smaller of them. Any payment I make in excess of the Minimum Monthly Payment will be applied to my balances subject to the highest ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE first, then to balances subject to lower ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES, in descending order of ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES until all balances subject to an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are paid in full. Thereafter, you will apply all payments in excess of the Minimum Monthly Payment, if applicable, in the same order as you apply the Minimum Monthly Payment.

The �Payment Due Date� will be shown on my monthly billing statement.

Returned Payment Fee: If a payment that was applied to my Account is returned to you unpaid for any reason, I will be charged
up to a $22.00 fee.

Lost or Stolen Card Notification and Liability: I will notify you AT ONCE if I believe that the Card, Account number, PIN, or any
combination of the three has been lost or stolen by immediately calling you at (800) 231-1626 or after hours or on weekends or
holidays at (800) 682-6075. Telephoning is the best way of keeping my possible losses down. I understand that my total liability to you shall not exceed $50.00 for any Account and/or Card transactions resulting from the loss, theft, or other unauthorized use of the Account and/or Card that occurs prior to the time I give notice to you. Such liability does not apply when the Account and/or Card is used to make an electronic transfer. I agree to cooperate fully in any investigation the Credit Union may conduct in connection with the possible loss, theft, or unauthorized use of my Card.

Returns and Adjustments: Merchants and others who honor the Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to my Account. If my credits and payments exceed what I owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon my written request or automatically after six months

Foreign Transactions: Transactions initiated in foreign currencies will be billed to the Account in U.S. dollars. The conversion to
U.S. dollars will be made in accordance with the Visa� operating regulations for international transactions. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa� from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which may vary from the rate Visa� itself receives, or the government mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date, plus a one percent (1%) International Service Assessment (ISA) fee for the currency conversion. The conversion rate may be different than the rate on the day of the transaction or date of the posting of the Account. When a credit to the Account does not fully offset a charge to the Account due to changes in the rate, I am responsible for the differences. The currency conversion fee will appear separately on the
Account statement for each foreign transaction converted to U.S. dollars.

U.S. dollar transactions made in foreign countries will be billed to the Account in U.S. dollars. An ISA fee of one percent (1%) will be billed to the Account for transactions conducted in U.S. dollars in a foreign country. The ISA fee will appear separately on the Account statement for each foreign transaction conducted in U.S. dollars.

Credit Vouchers (also known as returns) and Cash Reversals will not be billed either a currency conversion fee or an ISA fee, nor will transactions conducted on a U.S. military base, in a U.S. Territory, or within a U.S. Embassy or consulate.

Transaction Slips: My periodic statement will identify the merchant, electronic terminal or financial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advance, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the periodic statement. I will retain the copy of such slips furnished at the time of the transaction in order to verify my periodic statement. You may make a reasonable charge for any photocopies or slips I request.

Plan Merchant Disputes: The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor the Account and/or Card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services I purchase with the Card if I have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant or service provider, and (a) my purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union sent, provided, or participated in sending to me; or (b) my purchase cost more than $50 and was made in my state or within 100 miles of my home. Any other dispute, I must resolve directly with the plan merchant.

Effect of Agreement: This agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on my Account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips I sign or receive may contain different terms.

Overdraft Protection: You may, but shall not be required to; transfer funds in such increments as you may determine from time to time to clear any overdraft on my Share Draft Account by an advance on my Visa� depending on the overdraft sequence I selected for my overdraft protection. Whether or not such a transfer occurs will be controlled by your Visa� Card and Truth-In-Savings Disclosure Agreements. In any event, I hold you harmless from any and all liability which might otherwise arise if the transfer does not occur. My overdraft protection automatically ceases if the Agreement is ever cancelled or terminated or my Account is in default.

GENERAL TERMS
Lien on Shares/Security Interest: If I have voluntarily agreed to a lien on shares in my Visa� Application, I understand and agree that if I am in default on the Account, you may impress and enforce a lien on all shares (except IRA accounts) then on deposit needed by you to repay the unpaid balance of the Account in accordance with California Financial Code �14856 and your bylaws. Property given as security under this Agreement, or for any other loan, with the exception of real property, secures all amounts I owe to the Credit Union now and in the future.

Payment: I promise to pay you or to your order in lawful money of the United States at your office or at the address set forth on my periodic statement, all sums advanced to me or any person I permit to use this Account on the terms and at the rates set forth herein. Payments will continue until I have paid in full the unpaid balance, INTEREST CHARGES and other FINANCE CHARGES, and any other fees and charges.

Prepayment or Irregular Payments: Though I need only pay the minimum monthly payment, I understand that I have the right to repay the unpaid balance at any time without penalty. I also understand that I will only be charged INTEREST CHARGES to the date I repay the unpaid balance. I may make larger payments without penalty and this may reduce the total amount of INTEREST CHARGES that I will repay. Any partial payment of the unpaid balance will not delay my next scheduled due date(s). I understand
that any payment that (a) delays or (b) accelerates the repayment of my unpaid balance will (a) increase or (b) decrease my INTEREST CHARGES.

Default: I will be in default if: (1) I do not pay on time or in the proper amount(s); (2) I fail to live up to any of the terms of this Agreement; (3) my creditworthiness is impaired; or (4) I die, become insolvent or am the subject of bankruptcy or receivership proceedings. In the event of any action by you to enforce this Agreement, I agree to pay the costs thereof, reasonable attorneys� fees, and other expenses. I understand and agree that INTEREST CHARGES at the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE as permitted
under this Agreement will continue to accrue until I repay my entire loan.

Responsibility: I agree to repay you according to the terms of this Agreement for all purchases, advances, INTEREST CHARGES and other FINANCE CHARGES, and late charges, if any, arising from the use of the Account by me or any other person I permit to use the Account, even if that person exceeds my permission. I cannot disclaim responsibility by notifying you, although you will close the Account if I so request and I will return all Cards to you. My obligation to pay the Account balance continues even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which you are not a party may direct me or one of the other persons responsible to pay the Account. Any person using the Account and/or Card is jointly and severally responsible with me for charges he or she makes, but if that person signs the Card he or she becomes a party to this Agreement and is also responsible for all charges on the Account, including mine. The Cards remain your property and I must recover and surrender to you all Cards upon your request and/or upon termination of this Account.

Delay in Enforcement: You can delay enforcing any of your rights, any number of times under this Agreement without losing them.

Termination of Account: You may terminate this Agreement upon my default. Either you or I may terminate this Agreement
at any time by notice to the other in writing. In no event shall any termination relieve me of my obligation to repay sums
already borrowed, collection costs and late charges, if any, and INTEREST CHARGES and other FINANCE CHARGES. The Card(s) I receive remain the property of the Credit Union and I must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by me or the Credit Union. I agree to return all the Cards issued to me or
any party designated by me.


Acceleration and Collection Costs: Upon my default, I understand and agree that you have the right to temporarily or permanently
suspend any and all Account and Card privileges and/or you may demand immediate payment of the Account Balance, including INTEREST CHARGES and other FINANCE CHARGES, late charges, and your collection costs, reasonable attorneys� fees,
and court costs (collectively, �collection-related charges�). I understand and agree that I will be subject to INTEREST CHARGES
(at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate), late charges, and collection-related charges under the terms disclosed in this
Agreement, until I repay my entire Account Balance. 

Governing Law: I understand and agree that this Agreement is made in California and shall be governed by the laws of the State of California to the extent that California law is not inconsistent with controlling federal law. I also understand and agree that  California�s choice of law rules shall not be applied if they would result in the application of non-California law.

Unauthorized Use: If I notice the loss or theft of my Card or a possible unauthorized use of my Card, I should write to you immediately at: P.O. Box 60890, Los Angeles, CA 90060-0890, or call you at (800) 231-1626 during business hours or (800) 682-6075 after business hours and on weekends and holidays. I will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after I notify you. I may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before my notice to you. In any case, my liability will not
exceed $50. My liability may be lower in cases of Visa� Card fraud in accordance with Current Visa� U.S.A., Inc. Operating Rules.

Payments Marked �Paid in Full�: You may accept checks, money orders, or other types of payment marked �payment in full� or using other language to indicate full satisfaction of any indebtedness, without being bound by such language or waiving any rights under this Agreement. Full satisfaction of indebtedness shall be accepted by you only in a written agreement, signed by an authorized representative.

Integrated Document(s): Any separate sheet of paper labeled �Additional Disclosure � Federal Truth-in-Lending Act� which is
delivered together with this Agreement is an integrated part of the Agreement.

Membership Requirement: I understand and agree that I must be and remain a member in good standing with you to be eligible
for continuing Account and/or Card privileges including future purchases and Advances. I understand and agree that you may
suspend the Account and/or Card privileges during any period in which I do not maintain my membership with you.

Statements and Notices: I will receive a statement each month showing transactions on my Account. Statements and notices will
be mailed to me at the most recent address I have given the Credit Union. Notice sent to any one of us will be considered
notice to all. I agree to promptly notify the Credit Union if I change my mailing address.

Electronic Fund Transfers: In the event a use of the Account, Card or the Account number of the Card constitutes an Electronic
Fund Transfer, the terms and conditions of my Electronic Fund Transfers Agreement and Disclosure with you shall govern such
transactions to the extent the Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement and Disclosure expands or amends this Agreement.

Accuracy of Information: The information provided in my request for credit (Application) is accurate and I will notify you in writing
immediately if there is a change in my financial condition. You may retain the Application. You may gather credit and/or
employment information you deem necessary and appropriate from time to time and you may give information concerning
your credit experience with me to others.

Transfer of Account: I cannot transfer or assign my Account to any other person or entity.

Copy Received: I acknowledge receipt of a copy of this Agreement and agree to its terms. I understand and agree that anyone who applies for, signs or uses the Classic Visa�, Student Visa� or Platinum Visa� Card Account agrees and accepts the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.


MY BILLING RIGHTS (Keep this Notice for future use.)
This notice tells me about my rights and your responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

What To Do If I Find a Mistake on My Statement
If I think there is an error on my statement, I must write to you at: Los Angeles Firemen�s Credit Union P.O. Box 60890
Los Angeles, CA 90060 I may also contact you via secure email through FIRE OnLine Home Banking at www.lafirecu.org.

In my letter, I must give you the following information: � Account information: My name and Account number. � Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. � Description of problem: If I think there is an error on my bill, I must describe what I believe is wrong and why I believe it is a mistake. I must contact you: � within 60 days after the error appeared on my statement.
� At least 3 business days before an automatic payment is scheduled, if I want to stop payment on the amount I think is wrong.
I must notify you of any potential errors in writing or electronically. I may call you, but if I do you are not required to investigate any
potential errors and I may have to pay the amount in question.


What Will Happen After You Receive My Letter
When you receive my letter, you must do two things: 1. Within 30 days of receiving my letter, you must tell me that you received my letter. You will also tell me if you have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving my letter, you must either correct the error or explain to me why you believe the bill is correct.

While you investigate whether or not there has been an error:
� You cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report me as delinquent on that amount. � The charge in question may remain on my statement, and you may continue to charge me interest on that amount. � While I do not have to pay the amount in question, I am responsible for the remainder of my balance. � You can apply any unpaid amount against my credit limit.
After you finish your investigation, one of two things will happen:
� If you made a mistake: I will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. � If you do not believe there was a mistake: I will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. You will send me a statement of the amount I owe and the date the payment is due. You may then report me as delinquent if I do not pay the amount you think I owe. If I receive your explanation but still believe my bill is wrong, I must write to you within 10 days telling you that I still refuse to pay. If I do so, you cannot report me as delinquent without also reporting that I am questioning my bill. You must tell me the name of anyone to whom you reported me as delinquent, and you must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If you do not follow all of the rules above, I do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount I question even if my bill is correct.

My Rights If I Am Dissatisfied With My Credit Card Purchases
If I am dissatisfied with the goods or services that I have purchased with my credit card, and I have tried in good faith to correct the
problem with the merchant, I may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true: 1. The purchase must have been made in my home state or within 100 miles of my current mailing address, and the purchase price must  have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if my purchase was based on an advertisement you mailed to me, of if you own the company that sold me the goods or services.) 2. I must have used my credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses my credit card account do not qualify. 3. I must not have fully paid for the purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and I am still dissatisfied with the
purchase, I must contact you in writing or electronically at: Los Angeles Firemen�s Credit Union P.O. Box 60890 Los Angeles, CA 90060 I may contact you via secure email through FIRE OnLine Home Banking at www.lafirecu.org. While you investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After you finish your investigation, you will tell me your decision. At that point, if you think I owe an amount and I do not pay, you may report me as delinquent.

In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement. 
1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will not allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that exceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled �Statements and Notices�) explaining your right to opt in to the Credit Union�s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in to such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. 
You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request.  
2. USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers and money orders. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal. 
3. PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account. 
4. PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement.  
5. FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date). To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of cash advances, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. 
The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases.  
For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances. 
6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. 
A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
7. FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
a. International Service Assessment Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a International Service Assessment Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency.  
b. Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
c. Over-the-Credit Limit Fee. If you have elected the feature to allow your account to go over your credit limit, we may charge you a fee as allowed by law. However, in no case will we impose an over-the-limit fee except in the next two billing cycles unless you have obtained an additional extension of credit in excess of such credit limit during each subsequent cycle or you have reduced the balance below the credit limit as of the end of each bill cycle. 
d. Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when a payment is returned for any reason. 
e. Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request. 
f. Document Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Document Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request (except when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union). 
g. Rush Fee. If your account is subject to a Rush Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each rush card that you request, providing delivery of the card is also available by standard mail service, without paying a fee for delivery. 
h. Emergency Card Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to an Emergency Card Replacement Fee, a fee will be charged to your account for each emergency replacement card that is issued to you. 
i. Card Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to a Card Replacement Fee, a fee will be charged for each replacement card that is issued to you for any reason. 
8. PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). For our Visa Platinum, the minimum payment is 2.30% of your total new balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on the statement. For our Visa Platinum Secured, the minimum payment is 2.30% of your total new balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on the statement. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit.  
9. PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate.  
10. SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount.  
Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default. 
 


Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement.  
11. DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. 
When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe. 
In the event that any suit is filed against the Credit Union with respect to this Agreement, or any credit card issued under this Agreement, the suit shall only be brought in the courts of the state of Florida. 
12. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION � You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at 1030 S. US Highway 1, Rockledge, FL 32955 or telephone (321) 690-2328 Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. EST, (321) 690-2328 Saturday 9:00 a.m. to noon p.m. or (800) 423-7503 seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00. 
13. CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT � As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. 
Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized. 
The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account.  
14. CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS � Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user. If you cannot return the authorized user's card or access checks and if you request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for a new account. 
15. CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION � You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. If your account is eligible for emergency cash and/or emergency card replacement services, and you request such services, you agree that we may provide personal information about you and your account that is necessary to provide you with the requested service(s). 
16. RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS � Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6) months. 
17. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS � The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit Union is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time. 
18. MERCHANT DISPUTES � The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home. 
19. JOINT ACCOUNTS � If this is a joint account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may terminate the account and the termination will be effective as to all of you. 
20. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT � This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms. 
21. NO WAIVER � The Credit Union can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement 
If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at: 
Community Credit Union of Florida 
1030 S. US Highway 1 
Rockledge, FL 32955 
In your letter, give us the following information: 
 - Account information: Your name and account number. 
 - Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
 - Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. 
You must contact us: 
 - Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. 
 - At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. 
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 
When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 
 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 
 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.  
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 
 - We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
 - The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. 
 - While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. 
 - We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.  
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 
 - If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. 
 - If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.  
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. 
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct. 
Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases 
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. 
To use this right, all of the following must be true: 
 1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 
 2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 
 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing [or electronically] at: 
Community Credit Union of Florida 
1030 S. US Highway 1 
Rockledge, FL 32955 
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

ACCOUNT
Taking into consideration the credit granted by Banco Popular of Puerto Rico (Bank) under this account, you bind yourself to pay to the Bank the total price of all purchases and cash advances (includes balance transfers from other institutions and convenience checks) made on this account, as well as the INTEREST CHARGES agreed upon under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The card may be used to purchase merchandise and services in those establishments where the Card is accepted, and to obtain cash advances from the Bank or any other bank that accepts the Cards, subject to the limits established from time to time by the Bank.

CREDIT LIMIT
You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases and cash advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each monthly Account Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you exceed your authorized credit limit; the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return or forfeit the Card and close the account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized credit limit. The Bank may approve purchases or cash advances which cause the balance to exceed your credit limit without waiving any of its rights under this Agreement.

INTEREST CHARGES APPLICABLE TO PUERTO RICO, US VIRGIN ISLANDS AND BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS:
The INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on the principal balance only. You will pay a monthly INTEREST CHARGE on the balance of your account for the billing period. This INTEREST CHARGE will be variable and can change for each billing period. The INTEREST CHARGE for purchases, balance transfers from other institutions and convenience checks will be determined by adding the value of the United States Prime Rate, published in The Wall Street Journal (Prime Rate) to a margin. This is equivalent to the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR). To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. The APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers from other institutions will be from 10.99% up to 23.99% with a corresponding Daily Periodic Rate from 0.0301 up to 0.0658%. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE for cash advances will be determined by adding the Prime Rate to a margin (please refer to this section on the cardmailer backer to obtain the margin and APR applicable to your account). The APR for Cash Advances will be from 18.24% up to 23.99% with a corresponding Daily Periodic Rate from 0.0500% up to 0.0658%.  To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. For Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands, the margin applicable to your account will depend on your credit history at the time of approval of your application. For British Virgin Islands the margin applicable to your account will depend on the banking relationship you maintain with the Bank at the time of approval of your application. For each billing period, the INTEREST CHARGE and the APR will be based on the Prime Rate current three business days prior to your account statement closing date. In the event that The Wall Street Journal is not published within any time period, the �LA TIMES� will be used as reference. An increase of the Prime Rate could represent an increase in the APR and in the minimum monthly payment. Any change in your INTEREST CHARGE will apply to the Balance in your account and to new transactions during the billing period. The INTEREST CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the number of days in the billing cycle. The Average Daily Balance is obtained by taking into account the initial balance for each day of the billing period, subtracting the payments and credits, and adding the purchases. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the said total is divided by the number of days included within the billing period

ANNUAL FEE
If applicable, the Annual Fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the Card.  Please refer to the �Annual Fee� section in the cardmailer backer.

MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 
The monthly minimum payment will be determined using the Outstanding Balance. In addition, the minimum monthly payment shall include the total amount in excess of your authorized credit limit. For balances from $0.01 to $24.99 the Minimum Payment will be the Outstanding Balance. For Balances of $25 and over the Minimum Payment will be 2% of the Outstanding Balance or the Finance Charges + $10 or a fixed amount of $25, whichever is higher.

PAYMENT APPLICATION
If you pay the required minimum payment of the monthly Account Statement, said payment shall be applied in the following way: first to INTEREST CHARGES and the remaining amount shall be applied first to the debt resulting from purchases and cash advances, with the lowest APR and then to the debt with the higher APR in ascending order. Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required payment the excess will be applied to the most onerous debt. Electronic, telephone and mailed payments are credited on the same day if they are received by 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday (excluding holidays). Mailed payments shall be received at the address indicated on your Account Statement, made with a check drawn against the Bank, and accompanied with the payment stub. It will be also processed the same date if the payment is made through a Banco Popular branch in Puerto Rico or Virgin Islands during business hours in cash, or by check drawn against the Bank. Credit of other payments that do not meet these requirements may be delayed five business days during which interests will not accrue.

In each Account Statement, the following entries will be shown, as applicable: new balance, minimum payment due, payment due date, credit limit, available credit, days in billing cycle, Late Payment Warning, Minimum Payment Warning, previous balance, payments, interest charged, fees charged, other credits, debits, purchases, balance transfers from other institutions, convenience checks and cash advances made within said period, year to date totals for fees and interest charged, interest charge calculation by balance type and the Annual Percentage Rate, You must notify the Bank, in writing, of any error in the Account Statement, within sixty (60) days, following the date on which the statement was mailed.

The APR, INTEREST CHARGES and Monthly Minimum Payment, of your Installment Plan may vary for each billing cycle.

If you have received a personal identi?cation number (PIN), you may use your Card and PIN to obtain advances at any ATM that accepts your Card. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, such advances shall be treated as Cash Advances under this Agreement.  
4 Convenience Checks: Upon request, and from time to time, we may send you convenience checks for use in borrowing under this Agreement. All convenience checks you use will be treated as cash advances under this Agreement unless we advise you otherwise. You may not use the convenience checks to make payments on any MCU credit card account. You understand that if you use a convenience check to make a purchase and you have a dispute with that purchase, the dispute is not covered by the Billing Rights Summary below. You understand that the convenience checks will not be returned to you. 
5 Purchases Treated as Cash Advances: 	We consider certain transactions to be the equivalent of cash advances, and we reserve the right to treat them as cash advances under this Agreement. Those transactions include using the Card or Account to purchase wire transfer money orders, money orders that are not issued by a ?nancial institution or are not in U.S. currency, travelers checks, casino gaming chips, lottery tickets, off-track betting, wagers at racetracks, and tax payments. 
6 Maximum Credit Limit: We will from time to time notify you of the maximum amount of credit which we will extend you under this Agreement. A portion of your credit limit, called the cash 

advance limit, will be available for cash advances. We may increase or decrease the credit limit or cash advance limit at anytime. The cash advance limit will be shown on your monthly statement. We will not be responsible for failing to extend credit to you under this Agreement. You agree not to allow the balance on your account to go over the maximum credit limit.  We will not extend credit if: 
� The extension of credit would cause the balance of your account to exceed your credit limit or if the balance of your account already exceeds your credit limit, or 
� Anything has happened that allows us to declare your account in default and therefore immediately due, or 
� Your Card has been canceled or suspended, or 
� Your Card has expired. If we do extend credit under any of the conditions above, it will be covered by the terms and provisions of this Agreement. We may delay extending credit if you have previously sent us a payment check or other negotiable instrument which has been returned as unpaid for any reason. 

7. Monthly Billing Statement: If you have a balance in your account, we will send you a monthly billing statement. It will show the total amountofyourPurchasesandCashAdvance Accounts,the ?nance charge, the minimum payment due, and the date the payment is due. 
8a. Finance Charge on Purchases �A ?nance charge will be imposed on each Purchase from the date the Purchase is posted to your account until the date it is paid in full, with the following exceptions: You may avoid ?nance charges on Purchases during any billing period if: (1) the opening balance on Purchases for that billing period was zero (0); or (2) the total of payments and credits posted during the billing period equals or exceeds the opening balance for that billing period. 
We calculate the Finance Charge on Purchases by applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your Purchase Account (including current transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your Purchases Account each day, add any new Purchases and subtract any payments or credits applied to Purchases that day, unpaid ?nance charges, late charges, overlimit fees and returned item fees. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the �average daily balance� which is shown on your statement as the Finance Charge Balance for Purchases. Finally, we multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate and the number of days in the billing period. 
The daily periodic rate and corresponding Annual Percentage Rate may vary (increase or decrease) quarterly based upon the movement in the highest prime rate as published by the Wall Street Journal on March 15th, June 15th, September 15th, and December 15th of each year (�index date�). If the Wall Street Journal is not published 
on any of these dates, the index will be the highest prime rate published on the ?rst publication date immediately following the index date. To obtain the Annual Percentage Rate we add 6.9% to the published index. To obtain the daily periodic rate we divide the Annual Percentage Rate by 365. A change in the daily periodic rate and corresponding Annual Percentage Rate resulting from a change in the index on the index dates stated above will be effective as of the billing date indicated on your April, July, October and January monthly billing statements respectively. An increase in the Annual Percentage Rate may result in an increase in the amount of your minimum payment. 
8b. Finance Charge on Cash Advances: A ?nance charge will be imposed on each Cash Advance from the day the Cash Advance is obtained until the date it is paid in full. We calculate the Finance Charge on Cash Advances by adding any Transaction Fee applied to new Cash Advances to the amount determined by applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your Cash Advance Account (including current transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your Cash Advance Account each day, add any new Cash Advances, and subtract any payments or credits applied to Cash Advances that day, unpaid ?nance charges, late charges, overlimit fees, transaction fees, and returned item fees. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the �average daily balance� which is shown on your statement as the Finance Charge Balance for Cash Advances. Finally, we multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate of .04904% (corresponding Annual Percentage Rate of 17.90%) and the number of days in the billing period. 
8c. Minimum Finance Charge : There will be a minimum ?nance charge of ?fty cents ($.50) for each billing period in which a ?nance charge is payable on your Purchases Account. 
8d. Cash Advance Transaction Fee: You will pay a transaction fee (?nance charge) each time you obtain a Cash Advance. The transaction fee will be 3% of the amount advanced but not less than $2.00 or more than $30.00. 

9. 	Returned Item Fee: We will charge you a returned item fee of $20.00 whenever your payment is returned to us for insuf?cient funds or any other reason. 

10. Late Charges:You pay a late charge of $25.00 any time a minimum payment remains unpaid for more than one billing period.  

11. Overlimit Fee: You will pay an overlimit fee of $20.00 if the principal balance of Purchases and Cash Advances exceeds your established credit limit on the closing date of your billing period. 

12. Payment: You promise to pay us all the amounts borrowed under this Agreement and any other amounts which you may owe us pursuant to this Agreement. 

At any time and without penalty, you may repay all or part of what you owe. You must, however, make at least the minimum payment each month. This minimum payment will be the total of: (1) the greater of [a] 1/60th of the outstanding principal Cash Advances and Purchases, or [b] $5.00, or the balance due, whatever is less; plus (2) currently calculated ?nance charges, cash advance transaction fees, other fees and charges incurred during the billing period, and insurance premium charges; plus (3) any minimum payment amount which is past due; plus (4) any amount in excess of your credit limit. 
Paying more than the minimum payment for your account for any billing period will not relieve you of the obligation to pay any further minimum payment for your account. 
13. PaymentAllocation:Your payment will be applied in the following order to any of these costs you owe: (1) collection costs, (2) fees and other card charges, (3) late charges, ?nance charges and insurance premiums in manner and order Credit Union elects, 
(4) unpaid principal balance of accrued Purchases and Cash Advances. 

14. Insurance: Credit life insurance and/or credit disability insurance may be made available to you by the Credit Union. Insurance coverage is not required by us as a condition for the extension of credit. If you should elect and qualify for the same, the coverage will be up to the minimum amount of credit extended to you. If you die, the insurance proceeds will be used to pay off your outstanding debt on the account. If you wish to have this coverage, you will give us a dated and signed written statement that you desire to obtain insurance coverage before we make it available. A certi?cate describing the coverage will be mailed to you 30 days after coverage begins. The premiums for this insurance will be due monthly and will be added to your minimum payment each billing period. 

15. Default: 	You will be in default if you fail to make a minimum payment when due. You will be in default if you break any promise you made under this Agreement, or under any other written agreement made in connection with use of the card. You will also be in default if you become insolvent, declare bankruptcy or die. When you are in default, the Credit Union may demand immediate payment of the entire amount you owe under this Agreement without giving you advance notice. 

Also, we may prohibit any further transactions on your Account, cancel the Cards, and revoke any privileges attaching to the Cards. You agree to surrender all Cards to us or our designee upon demand. If you default, we, at our option, may refuse to pay any of your convenience checks that are presented to us.

becomes due. We can do any of the following without notifying you or losing any right against you:

In this Agreement, the words you, your and yours mean the undersigned Cardholder.  The words we, us and our mean LGE Community Credit Union.  
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Your VISA Card may not be used for any illegal transaction.  Such use may subject you to criminal penalties, and will result in your VISA account privileges being terminated.  NO CHARGES OR DEBITS INCURRED FOR GAMBLING TRANSACTIONS WILL BE KNOWINGLY HONORED BY THE CREDIT UNION, and it shall be the Credit Union�s policy to attempt to �block� all such transactions.
Purchases and Cash Advances.  You can use the Card for Purchases and Cash Advances.  You will owe us for these amounts plus Finance Charges and Other Charges, if any, all payable in United States Dollars.  
Monthly Statement.  We will generate one monthly statement provided to you electronically or by email on file at the time the statement is generated.  A statement will generate if your account has activity, including debits, credits, Finance Charges or Finance Charges or other charges during the Billing Cycle.  You must pay us (or if we elect, to any party to whom we transfer and assign your Account) according to the Terms and Conditions of the Account.  
Terms and Conditions (including Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure):
(a) The conditions under which a Finance Charge will be imposed:
Finance Charge � The cost of credit extended to you on the Account resulting from applying the Periodic Rate to the Average Daily Balance.
(1) Purchases.  A Finance Charge will accrue from the date the transaction posts to the account during a Billing Cycle when there is a Previous Balance and it is not paid in full within the first 25 days of the Billing Cycle.  A Finance Charge that will accrue from the first day of the next Billing Cycle will be imposed on Purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the Closing Date.
(2) Cash Advances.  Credit extended by us to you in the form of a loan made when you present the Card to us or to any financial institution honoring the Card, or use of any other credit instrument, device, overdraft coverage plan or automated teller machine we make available to you.  A Finance Charge computed on a Periodic Rate Basis will be imposed on Cash Advances from the date posted to the Account to the date paid.  The Finance Charge accrued on Cash Advances between the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle and the date your Account is credited will appear on your next statement.  There is no grace period within which to pay to avoid this Finance Charge. 

(3) If your Account is subject to a Finance Charge, then the more that you pay and the sooner you pay the less your Finance Charge will be.
(b) The method of determining the balance upon which a Finance Charge will be imposed:
(1) We calculate the Cash Advance Finance Charge on your Account by applying a Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of Cash Advances (rounded to the nearest penny), on your Account (including current transactions for Cash Advances).  To determine the �Average Daily Balance� of Cash Advances we begin with the previous day�s ending, Principal Cash Advance Balance (fees are not included).  To this balance, for each day in the billing period, we add new cash advances, new balance transfers, and other debit transactions; then subtract any principal payments or other credit transactions.  The sum of the ending daily balances for the Billing Period is then divided by the number of days in the Billing Period.  The result is the �Average Daily Balance� of Cash Advances.  
(2) We calculate the Purchase Finance Charge on your Account by applying a Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of Purchases (rounded to the nearest penny), on your Account (including current transactions for Purchases).  To determine the �Average Daily Balance� of Purchases we begin with the previous day�s ending, Principal Purchase Balance (fees are not included).  To this balance, for each day in the billing period, we add new Purchases and other debit transactions; then subtract any principal payments or other credit transactions.  The sum of the ending daily balances for the Billing Period is then divided by the number of days in the Billing Period.  The result is the �Average Daily Balance� of Purchases.  If the entire Previous Balance is paid in full within the first 25 days of the Billing Period, the Average Daily Balance of Purchases will be considered to be $0.
(c) The method of determining the amount of the FINANCE CHARGE:  The FINANCE CHARGE imposed during a Billing Cycle will be determined by:
(1) Multiplying the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances by the Monthly Periodic Rate for Cash Advances; the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is determined by multiplying the Monthly Periodic Rate by 12.
(2) Multiplying the Average Daily Balance of Purchases by the Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases; the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RAGE is determined by multiplying the Monthly Periodic Rate by 12.
(3) Adding the results of (1) and (2).
(4) The FINANCE CHARGE and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are determined by the application of a Variable Rate and may vary monthly:  The Monthly Periodic Rate will be determined monthly in advance of the Billing Cycle to which it will be applied, during the last week of the preceding month, in the following manner:  (a) We will determine the average of the 26-Week Treasury Bill (�T-Bill�) Rates for the preceding four weeks, (b) then we may add up to 18% percentage points to such T-Bill Rate, as announced, for Purchases and Cash Advances; (c) We will then divide the resulting percentage by 12 to determine the Monthly Periodic Rate applicable to Cash Advances and Purchases for the next Billing Cycle.  If the Federal Reserve Bank should cease publishing the 26-Week T-Bill Rate, then we reserve the right to change the index or method of computing your interest.   If we do change the index, we will notify you.
(5) An increase/decrease in the 26-week T-Bill may cause a corresponding increase/decrease in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, and may increase/decrease the number of your payments of the same amount.  An increase/decrease in the T-Bill will take effect on the first day of the Billing Cycle.
(6)The Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases or Cash Advances will not exceed 1.5000% (corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 18%).
(7) Please see Attachment �A� for the current ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE.

(d) The conditions under which any Other Changes may be imposed:

(1) Late Payment Charge.  If you do not pay a Minimum Payment within 10 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle within which it is due, a Late Payment Charge will be imposed on your Account.  Please see Attachment �A� for current Late Payment Fee.
(2) Returned Check Fee.  If any check in payment of your Account is returned unpaid for any reason we may charge a returned check  fee.  Please see Attachment �A� for current Returned Check Fees.
 (3) Statement/Charge Slip Copy Fee.  We may impose a charge for each copy of your monthly statement that you request.  We may impose a charge for each copy of a standard transaction-charge slip you request and for each copy of a travel and entertainment transaction-charge slip you request the charge.  No charge will be imposed in connection with any good faith assertion of a billing error given to us in writing. Please see Attachment �A� for current Statement/Charge Slip Copy Fees.

(4) Stop Payment Fee.  If we accept a stop payment order from you on a Convenience Check, we will charge your Account a stop payment fee.  Please see Attachment �A� for current Stop Payment Fees.

(6) Convenience Check Copy Fee.  Unless your request is a Billing Error Inquiry as defined by the Federal Fair Credit Billing Act, we will charge you a fee for each copy of a Convenience Check, which we provide.   Please see Attachment �A� for current copy charges.

  (e) The conditions under which we may retain or acquire any security interest in any property to secure the payment of any credit extended on the Account:  The line of credit applied for herein shall be unsecured, and we waive and disclaim the attachment of this Agreement, or any debt created or incurred pursuant hereto, of any and all security interest which may arise or result by operation of Law prior to judgment or under the terms of any other agreement, note or security deed in any property of any kind belonging to you.

If you elect not to pay your balance in full, a payment according to the following schedule must be made by you within 25 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle as shown on your statement.

PERIODIC FINANCE CHARGE CALCULATION METHODS

The Periodic Finance Charge Calculation Method applicable to your account for Cash Advance and Credit purchases of goods and services that you obtain through the use of your Card is specified in the Interest Charge Calculation/Plan Level Information box on your credit card statement and explained below:

	Method A � Average Daily Balance (including current transactions). The Finance Charge on purchases begins from the date the transaction is posted to your account and the Finance Charge on cash advances begins from the date you obtained the cash advance, or the first day of the billing cycle in which it is posted to your account, whichever is later. There is no grace period.
      The Finance Charges for a billing cycle are computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the �average daily balance� of your account. To get the average daily balance, we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, subtract any payments, credit, non-accruing fees and unpaid finance charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle.
	
	Method E � Average Daily Balance (excluding current transactions). To avoid incurring an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases (and cash advances if Method E is specified as applicable to cash advances) reflected on your monthly statement, you must pay the New Balance shown on your monthly statement on or before the Payment Due Date. The grace period for the New Balance of purchases extends to the Payment Due Date.

This gives us the daily balance. Then we add all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle.
      
      Method F - Average Daily Balance (including current transactions). To avoid incurring an additional Finance Charge on the balance of cash advances (and purchases if Method F is specified as applicable to purchases) reflected on your monthly statement, you must pay the Beginning Balance shown on your monthly statement on or before the Payment Due Date. No grace period is provided for current cycle transactions.

      Method G - Average Daily Balance (including current transactions). To avoid incurring an additional Finance Charge on the balance of purchases (and cash advances if Method G is specified as applicable to cash advances) reflected on your monthly statement and, on any new purchases (and if applicable, cash advances) appearing on your next monthly statement, you must pay the New Balance shown on your monthly statement, on or before the Payment Due Date. The grace period for the New Balance of purchases extends to the Payment Due Date.
      The Finance Charges for a billing cycle are computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the �average daily balance� of your account. To get the average daily balance, we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, subtract any payments, credit, non-accruing fees and unpaid finance charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle.

In this Classic VISA Credit Card Agreement and Federal Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statement (�Agreement�) the words �I�, �me�, �my� and �mine� mean each and all of those who apply for, or who sign for or use the Card and/or Account.  The words �Credit Union�, �LAPFCU�, �you�, �your�, and �yours� mean Los Angeles Police Federal Credit Union. �Card� means the Classic VISA Credit Card(s) issued to me and any duplicates and/or renewals you may issue. �Account� means my Classic VISA Credit Card Account with you. 
By requesting and receiving, signing, using or permitting others to use the Card and/or Account issued to me by you, I agree to be bound by the terms and conditions as set forth herein and any amendments and/or change in terms thereto. 
AUTHORIZATION AND PAYMENT:  I authorize you to pay and charge my Account for all Purchases and Cash Advances made or obtained by me or anyone I authorize to use my Card or Account.  I will be obligated to pay all such Purchases and Cash Advances charged to my Account whether resulting from: (1) actual use of my Card or Convenience Checks; (2) mail order or telephone, computer, or other electronic Purchases made without presenting the Card; or (3) any other circumstance where I authorize a charge, or authorize someone else to make a charge, to my Account (collectively, �authorized charges�).  I promise to pay you or to your order in U.S. Dollars with an instrument drawn on a financial institution in the United States at your office or at the address set forth on my periodic statement all authorized charges on the terms and at the rates set forth herein, plus any FINANCE CHARGES assessed on my Account, and any other charges and fees which I may owe you under the terms of this Agreement (the �Account Balance�).  Payments will continue until I have paid in full the Account Balance.  To protect me and you, you may, in your sole discretion, place a temporary hold on the credit available to me any time you receive a payment of $1,000 or more from me via a payment method other than cash, certified funds or electronic transfer.  In such cases, the hold on my available credit will remain in place until payment is actually collected by you.
CHANGE OF TERMS:  Account and agreement terms are not guaranteed for any period of time.  I understand and agree that you may amend, modify, add to, or delete from this Agreement any of its terms and conditions, including financial terms such as the method of application and the amount of any FINANCE CHARGE, ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, monthly periodic rate and/or fee in accordance with applicable laws, by mailing a notice of the change to me at my last known address.  I also understand that in the event of a significant change, as defined under the federal Truth in Lending Act, any such notice will be mailed at least forty-five (45) days prior to the effective date of the significant change as required by applicable law.  I will have the right to reject significant changes to this Agreement prior to the effective date of such changes, unless I fail to make a required minimum payment within sixty (60) days after its due date.  If I reject any such significant change, you reserve the right to close my Account and require me to repay the Account Balance at terms no less favorable to me than your choice of the following:  (1) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement in effect as of the date I notify you of my rejection; (2) by recalculating my Minimum Monthly Payment based on a five (5) year amortization of my Account Balance from the date I notify you of my rejection; or (3) by recalculating my Minimum Monthly Payment based on a percentage of the Account Balance that is no more than twice the percentage required on the date I notify you of my rejection.  Regardless of whether I reject the significant changes, the new terms will apply to any transactions that occur more than fourteen (14) days after you provide notice of the change in terms to me.  You may change the terms of this Agreement based on information in my credit report, market conditions, business strategy or for any other reason.  Notice of a change in terms is required, but may be sent as late as the effective date of the change where the change has been agreed to in writing, by me.
FINANCE CHARGES: The FINANCE CHARGE for a billing cycle will be the sum of three (3) components set forth below.  I understand and agree that under the �Change of Terms� section above, you have the right in your sole and absolute discretion to change the amount of any ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, Monthly Periodic Rate and/or FINANCE CHARGE that may apply to my Account.
Cash Advance Fee:  One (1) component of the FINANCE CHARGE is the Cash Advance Fee. Cash Advance transactions are subject to a Cash Advance Fee which shall be the greater of $2.00 or 2% of the amount of the advance which is posted to the Account during the billing cycle, but not to exceed $25.00 per Cash Advance.  In addition, a Cash Advance Fee may not cause the FINANCE CHARGE to exceed the maximum rate permitted for a federal credit union. Cash Advances are subject to the Monthly Periodic Rate (see below) during the billing cycle in which the Cash Advance Fee is imposed. 
Foreign Transactions Fee:  The second (2nd) component of the FINANCE CHARGE is the Foreign Transactions Fee.  Purchases, Cash Advances, and credit transactions made in foreign currencies are subject to a Foreign Transactions Fee FINANCE CHARGE of 1.0% of the amount of the Purchase, Cash Advance, or credit transaction which is posted to the Account during the billing cycle. International Purchases, Cash Advances, and credit transactions that are not made in foreign currencies are subject to a Foreign Transactions Fee FINANCE CHARGE of .8% of the amount of the Purchase, Cash Advance, or credit transaction which is posted to the Account during the billing cycle.
Monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE, Monthly Periodic Rate, and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE :  The third (3rd) component of the FINANCE CHARGE is the Monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE.  The initial monthly periodic rate is a discounted monthly periodic rate with an initial discounted ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, as disclosed on the enclosed insert.  The initial discounted monthly periodic rate will remain in effect during my first six (6) monthly billing cycles unless I fail to make a payment when due or I make a payment that is returned (for further information, please refer to the PENALTY ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE section below).  Thereafter, the Monthly Periodic Rate used in calculating the monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are disclosed on the enclosed insert.  The Monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE is imposed as follows: 
Cash Advances:  A periodic FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on Cash Advances that I obtain through the use of my Card as of the date of each such Cash Advance and will continue to accrue until the Cash Advance is repaid. 
Credit Purchases of Goods and Services:  A periodic FINANCE CHARGE will be calculated on credit purchases that I obtain with my Card as of the date such credit purchase is posted to my Account and will continue to accrue until the date of repayment.  Periodic FINANCE CHARGES will be imposed on credit purchases only if they are not paid in full within twenty-five (25) days after the Statement Closing Date (�Grace Period�). 
MINIMUM FINANCE CHARGE:  A minimum FINANCE CHARGE of $0.50 will be assessed whenever a monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE is imposed.
MONTHLY PERIODIC FINANCE CHARGE, MONTHLY PERIODIC RATE AND ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE:  The Monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE for each billing cycle will be calculated by applying the Average Daily Balance (described below) for my Account for the billing cycle by the Monthly Periodic Rate.  The Monthly Periodic Rate is determined by dividing the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE by 12. 
PENALTY ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE:  A penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 17.90% (corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate of 1.492%) may be applied to my Account Balance if I fail to make a payment when due or I make a payment that is returned.  You will provide me notice of such penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE at least forty-five (45) days prior to the effective date of the penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE.  I will have the right to reject the penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE prior to the effective date of such penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, unless I fail to make a required minimum payment within sixty (60) days after its due date.  If I reject the penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, you reserve the right to close my Account and require me to repay the Account Balance at terms no less favorable to me than your choice of the following:  (1) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement in effect as of the date I notify you of my rejection; (2) by recalculating my Minimum Monthly Payment based on a five (5) year amortization of my Account Balance from the date I notify you of my rejection; or (3) by recalculating my Minimum Monthly Payment based on a percentage of the Account Balance that is no more than twice the percentage required on the date I notify you of my rejection.  Regardless of whether I reject the penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, such rate will apply to any transactions that occur more than fourteen (14) days after you provide notice of the penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE to me.  My ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will revert to the applicable �standard� ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE provided for in this Agreement, provided that I make six (6) consecutive Minimum Monthly Payments when due.
HOW TO COMPUTE THE CASH ADVANCES BALANCE (CONSISTING OF TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO CASH AND OTHER ADVANCE TRANSACTIONS) UPON WHICH PERIODIC FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED: 
Average Daily Balance (including current Cash Advance transactions):  You figure a portion of the FINANCE CHARGE on my Account by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate to the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including current Cash Advances).  To get the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advance transactions you take the beginning balance of Cash Advance transactions on my Account each day, add any new Cash Advances, and subtract any payments or credits, and unpaid FINANCE CHARGES.  This gives you the daily balance of Cash Advance transactions.  Then, you add up all the daily balances of Cash Advance transactions for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle.  This gives you the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advance transactions.  There is no grace period in order to avoid the imposition of FINANCE CHARGES on Cash Advances.  However, the combination of periodic FINANCE CHARGES, Cash Advance Fee and Foreign Transactions Fee, will not exceed the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE permitted under applicable law.
HOW TO COMPUTE THE PURCHASE BALANCE (CONSISTING OF TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES) UPON WHICH PERIODIC FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED: 
Average Daily Balance (including current Purchase transactions):  To avoid incurring an additional Periodic FINANCE CHARGE on the balance of Credit Purchases reflected on my periodic statement and on any new Credit Purchases appearing on my next periodic statement, I must pay the New Balance shown on my statement on or before the Payment Due Date.  You figure a portion of the FINANCE CHARGE on my Account by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate to the Average Daily Balance of Credit Purchases (including current Purchase transactions).  To get the Aver-age Daily Balance of Purchase transactions you take the beginning balance of Purchase transactions on my Account each day, add any new Purchases, and subtract any payments or credits, and unpaid FINANCE CHARGES.  This gives you the daily balance of Purchase transactions.  Then, you add up all the daily balances of Purchase transactions for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle.  This gives you the Average Daily Balance of Purchase transactions.  I have a 25 day grace period from the close of the statement period to pay the New Balance of Purchase transactions without incurring additional FINANCE CHARGES.  If the New Balance of Purchase transactions is not paid in full during this grace period, FINANCE CHARGES will be assessed using the Average Daily Balance method as explained above.
This determines my total periodic FINANCE CHARGES for the billing cycle.  Actual periodic FINANCE CHARGES will be shown on my periodic statement. 
CREDIT LIMIT:  You will establish a Credit Limit for me. At your discretion, you may increase or decrease my Credit Limit at any time, and may provide separate limits for Purchases and Cash Advances.  You will notify me if you do, either by mail or through my periodic statement.  If I object to any Credit Limit increase, I must notify you immediately in writing.  Upon receipt of such notice, my Credit Limit will be reduced to its prior limit, however, I will be responsible to pay any amounts by which I have exceeded the reduced limit.  I agree not to allow my Account Balance to exceed my Credit Limit.  I agree to advise you of any change in my financial condition which may affect my creditworthiness.  I agree to update the credit information that I have provided you, from time to time, on your demand.  I or my joint applicant for the Account may request a change to the Credit Limit orally, in writing, or electronically, but any such request must be approved by you.  If my Credit Limit is increased, I am immediately responsible for the new Credit Limit and any increase in the Account Balance even when it differs from an amount previously agreed to orally or in writing. 
MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT:  Every month, I must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date shown on my periodic statement.  By separate agreement, I may authorize you to automatically transfer the Minimum Payment Due from my Credit Union share or share draft account.  I may, of course, pay more frequently, pay more, or pay the Account Balance in full, and I will reduce my periodic FINANCE CHARGE by doing so.  The Minimum Payment Due will be either:  (a) 2% of my Account Balance, or $20, whichever is greater; or (b) my Account Balance, if it is less than $20.  In addition, I must pay any amount on my periodic statement listed as past due and any late charge.  At any time my Account Balance exceeds my Credit Limit, I must pay the excess. 
The �Payment Due Date� will be shown on my periodic statement. 
I understand and agree that any Minimum Monthly Payment made by me will be applied in the following order:  (a) unpaid fees and charges, if any; (b) unpaid periodic FINANCE CHARGE due on both Purchases and Cash Advances; (c) outstanding balances of Cash Advances and Purchases previously billed; and (d) current Cash Advances and Purchases.  Any payment I make in excess of the Minimum Monthly Payment will be applied in the following order:  (a) my Account Balance subject to a penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE; (b) my Cash Advance Balance; (c) my Purchases Balance; and (d) any remaining portion of my Account Balance in the order that my Minimum Monthly Payment would be applied.  
LATE PAYMENT FEE:  If you have not received my Minimum Payment Due within ten (10) days after the �Payment Due Date� listed on my periodic statement, I agree to pay a Late Payment Fee as set forth in the enclosed Schedule of Fees which accompanies this Agreement and is incorporated by reference herein as though set forth in full.  
RETURNED PAYMENT FEE:  If a payment that was applied to my Account is returned to you unpaid for any reason I agree to pay a Returned Payment Fee as set forth in the enclosed Schedule of Fees.  This fee will also apply to any payments made by automatic transfer that cannot be posted due to insufficient funds in my regular share or checking account.  
CASH ADVANCE FEE:  For each Cash Advance, a Cash Advance Fee of either $2 or 2% of the amount of the Advance will be charged, whichever is greater, subject to a maximum fee of $25 for each Cash Advance transaction.  Cash Advance transactions include ATM withdrawals, online funds transfers, telephonic funds transfers, and in person Cash Advances at a financial institution�s branch from the Account.  
CREDIT LIFE AND/OR DISABILITY INSURANCE: The purchase of this insurance is entirely voluntary and is not a factor in the approval of the extension of credit.  If credit life and/or disability insurance is available to me on the Account, and I request it by completing the Credit Insurance Application/Schedule which contains current rates and qualifying information, the premium will be calculated monthly by multiplying the premium rate by the outstanding balance on the Account.  You will add the premium amount to my Account Balance on each Billing Cycle Close Date.  I acknowledge receiving a copy of the Credit Insurance Application/Schedule. 
PREPAYMENT OR IRREGULAR PAYMENTS: Though I need only pay the Minimum Payment Due, I understand that I have the right to repay my Account Balance at any time without penalty.  I also understand and agree that I will only be charged periodic FINANCE CHARGES to the date I repay my entire Account Balance.  I may make larger payments without penalty and this may reduce the total amount of periodic FINANCE CHARGES that I will repay.  If I pay more than the Minimum Payment Due in any month and there is still a balance due, I must continue to make Minimum Payments in future months.  Any partial payment of my Account Balance will not advance my next payment due date(s).  I understand and agree that any payment that: (a) delays or (b) accelerates the repayment of my Account Balance will:  (a) increase or (b) decrease my Monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE. 
PAYMENTS BY AUTOMATIC TRANSFER:  If I request payment by automatic transfer, I understand and agree that no payment can or will be made if there are insufficient or uncollected funds in the designated account to make the scheduled payment.  Should this event occur, I under-stand and agree that I will not be released from making the payment.  Any automatic transfer I have requested will remain in effect until I cancel it in writing or the Account Balance is paid in full.  You may cancel this service at your discretion.
DEFAULT:  I will be in default if: (1) I do not pay on time or in the proper amount(s); (2) I have made a false or misleading statement on my application; (3) I fail to live up to any of the terms of this Agreement; (4) my creditworthiness is impaired; or (5) I die, become insolvent or am the subject of bankruptcy or receivership proceedings.  In the event of any action by you to enforce this Agreement, I agree to pay the costs thereof, including reasonable attorneys� fees, and other expenses.  I understand and agree that FINANCE CHARGES at the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE as permitted under this Agreement will continue to accrue until I repay my entire Account Balance.
ACCELERATION AND COLLECTION COSTS:  Upon my default, I understand and agree that you have the right to temporarily or permanently suspend any and all Account and Card privileges and/or you may demand immediate payment of the Account Balance, including FINANCE CHARGES, Late Payment Fees, and your collection costs, reasonable attorneys� fees, and court costs (collectively �collection-related charges�), and all other fees and charges hereunder.  I understand and agree that I will be subject to FINANCE CHARGES (at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate), Late Payment Fees, collection-related charges, and all other fees and charges under the terms disclosed in this Agreement, until I repay my entire Account Balance.  In the event of any action by you to enforce this Agreement, I agree to pay the costs thereof, reasonable attorneys� fees, and other expenses.
ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER:  In the event the use of the Card, the Account or the Account number of the Card constitutes an Electronic Fund Transfer, the terms and conditions of my Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement with you shall govern such transactions to the extent the Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement expands or amends this Agreement. 
PURCHASES AND ADVANCES:  I may make purchases and request advances in accordance with then current loan policies up to my Credit Limit.  I understand and agree that all purchases and other transactions requested by me or anyone I have permitted to use the Card(s) and/or Account are subject to your approval. 
USING THE CARD:  To make a Purchase or obtain an Advance, I may present the Card or Card number to a participating VISA plan merchant, to you or to another financial institution that accepts Classic VISA Credit Cards and sign or authorize a sales or Cash Advance draft.  Certain purchases and Cash Advances will require an authorization prior to completion of the transaction.  In some cases, I may be asked to provide identification. If I have received a personal identification number (�PIN�), I may also use my Card and PIN to obtain Cash Advances at any Automatic Teller Machine (�ATM�) that accepts my Card or other type of electronic terminal that provides access to the VISA system.  (Not all ATMs accept Classic VISA Credit Cards.)  My PIN is confidential and should not be disclosed to anyone.  I agree not to write my PIN on my Card, I will not keep my Card and PIN together, and I will not provide my PIN to anyone who is not an authorized user.  Advances through ATM access will be treated as Cash Advances.  Advances at authorized ATMs are limited to a total of $300.00 per day.  I may also provide my Card number verbally, electronically, or in writing to a merchant to complete a mail, electronic or telephone transaction.
If your authorized system is not working, I may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if I have sufficient available credit. Occasionally for security reasons, you may block usage of my Card and/or Account in certain foreign countries or geographical areas.  You will not be liable to me if any of these events happen. 
My Card and/or Account may not be used directly or indirectly for:  (1) any illegal activity or transaction; or (2) any gambling, gaming, betting or similar activity or transaction. Further, I may not utilize my Card and/or Account for the purchase of any goods or services on the Internet that involve gambling, betting or any similar activity or transaction. Such transactions include, but may not be limited to, any quasi-cash or online gambling transaction, any electronic commerce transaction conducted over an open network, and any betting transaction including the purchase of lottery tickets or casino gaming chips or off-track betting or wagering.  However, in the event that a charge or transaction described in this paragraph is approved and processed, I will still be responsible for such charges. 
FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS:  Purchases, cash advances and credits made in foreign currencies will be billed to my Account in U.S. dollars.  The conversion to U.S. dollars will be made in accordance with the VISA operating regulations for international transactions.  Such regulations provide for either a .8% currency exchange fee for single currency transactions (transactions made internationally without a currency conversion) or 1% currency exchange fee for multi-currency international transactions (transactions made internationally that require a currency conversion), which is added to the amount of the purchase, cash advance, or credit and retained by VISA.  Transactions conducted in U.S. military bases, territories, embassies, or consulates are not considered international transactions and will not be subject to the .8% currency exchange fee.  The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by VISA from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date.  The conversion rate may be different than the rate on the day of the transaction or date of the posting of the Account.  When a credit to the Account does not fully offset a charge to the Account due to changes in the rate, I am responsible for the differences. 
RESPONSIBILITY:  I agree to repay you according to the terms of this Agreement for all purchases, advances, FINANCE CHARGES, Late Payment Fees, and all other fees and charges, if any, arising from the use of the Card and/or Account by me or any other person I permit to use the Account, even if that person exceeds my permission.  I cannot disclaim responsibility by notifying you, although you will close the Account if I so request and I will return all Cards to you and I will repay the unpaid balance to you.  My obligation to pay the Account balance continues even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which you are not a party may direct me or one of the other persons responsible to pay the Account.  Any person using the Account and/or Card is jointly and severally responsible with me for charges he or she makes, but if that person signs the Card he or she becomes a party to this Agreement and is also responsible for all charges on the Account, including mine.  The Cards remain your property and I must recover and surrender to you all Cards upon your request and/or upon termination of this Account. 
TRANSACTION SLIPS:  My periodic statement will identify the merchant, electronic terminal or financial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, Cash Advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the periodic statement.  I will retain the copy of such slips furnished at the time of the transaction in order to verify my periodic statement.  You may assess a reasonable fee for any photocopies or slips I request. 
PLAN MERCHANT DISPUTES:  You are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution or electronic terminal to honor the Account and/or Card.  You are subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services I purchase with the Card only if I have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant, and: (a) my purchase was made in response to an advertisement you sent or participated in sending me; or (b) my purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made from a plan merchant in my state or within 100 miles of my current mailing address.  Any other dispute I must resolve directly with the plan merchant. 
RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS:  Merchants and others who honor the Account and/or Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending you a credit slip which you will post to my Account.  If my credits and payments exceed what I owe you, you will hold and apply this credit balance against future Purchases and Advances, or if it is $1.00 or more, refund it on my written request. 
UNAUTHORIZED USE:  If I notice the loss or theft of my Card 
or a possible unauthorized use of my Card, I should write to you 
immediately at:  P. O. Box 10188, Van Nuys, California 91410-
0188, or call you at (877) 695-2732.  I will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after I notify you.  I may, however, be liable for unau-thorized use that occurs before my notice to you.  In any case, my liability will not exceed $50.   My liability may be zero ($0) in cases of VISA Credit Card fraud in accordance with current VISA U.S.A., Inc. Operating Regulations.  This does not apply to ATM transactions using the Card and PIN. 
SURRENDER OF CARD(S):  The Card(s) remains your property and, if you request, I must surrender to you all Cards you have issued on the Account. 
LOST OR STOLEN CARD(S) NOTIFICATION AND LIABILITY:  
I will notify you AT ONCE by immediately calling you at (866) 604-
0381 or, if I am outside the U.S., call collect at (727) 570-4881 if I believe that the Card, Account number, PIN or any combination of the three has been lost or stolen.  Telephoning is the best way of keeping my possible losses down.  I understand that my total liability to you shall not exceed $50.00 for any Account and/or Card transactions resulting from the loss, theft or unauthorized use of the Account and/or Card that occurs prior to the time I give notice to you.  Such liability does not apply when the Account and/or Card is used to make an electronic transfer.
PAYMENTS MARKED �PAID IN FULL�:  You may accept checks, money orders, or other types of payment marked �payment in full� or using other language to indicate full satisfaction of indebtedness, without being bound by such language or waiving any rights under this Agreement.  Full satisfaction of indebtedness shall be accepted by you only in written agreement, signed by an authorized representative of the Credit Union. 
DELAY IN ENFORCEMENT:  You can delay enforcing any of your rights under this Agreement without losing them. 
GOVERNING LAW:  I understand and agree that this Agreement is made in California and shall be governed by the laws of the State of California to the extent that California law is not inconsistent with controlling federal law.  I also understand and agree that California�s choice of law rules shall not be applied if they would result in the application of non-California law. 
INTEGRATED DOCUMENT(S):  Any separate sheet of paper labeled �Addendum to the Classic VISA Credit Card Agreement and Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement� which is delivered together with this form is an integral part of the Agreement and is incorporated herein as if set forth in full. 
MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENT:  I understand and agree that I must be and remain a member in good standing with you to be eligible for continuing Account and/or Card privileges including future purchases and advances.  I understand and agree that you may suspend the Account and/or Card privileges during any period in which I do not maintain my membership in good standing with you. 
TERMINATION:  You may terminate this Agreement upon my default.  Either you or I may terminate this Agreement for other good cause.  In no event shall any termination relieve me of my obligation to repay sums already borrowed, FINANCE CHARGES, Late Payment Fees, and all other fees and charges hereunder, if any.  I agree to return all of the Cards issued to me or any party designated by me. 
CREDIT INFORMATION:  I authorize you to investigate my credit when opening, renewing or reviewing the Account, and I authorize you to disclose information regarding the Account to credit bureaus and other creditors who inquire of you about my credit standing to the extent authorized by law.  I understand that you may provide information to credit bureaus about negative information concerning my Account (such as my insolvency, delinquency, late payment or default on my Account) which the credit bureaus may include in my credit report. 
CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, EMPLOYMENT STATUS:  I understand and agree that I must report to you any change in my name, address, employment status, or any other information that may negatively affect my creditworthiness. 
ACCURACY OF INFORMATION:  The information provided in my request for credit (Application) is accurate and I will notify you in writing imme-diately if there is a change in my financial condition.  You may retain the Application.  I understand that it is a violation of Section 1014,",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

You agree not to let the account balance exceed this approved Credit Line. Each payment you make on the account will restore your Credit Line by the amount of the payment which is applied to principal. You may request an increase in your Credit Line by contacting us, and approval by a loan officer. By giving you written notice we may reduce your Credit Line from time to time, or with good cause, revoke your 

Card and Credit Line. Good cause includes your failure to comply with this Agreement, or our adverse reevaluation of your creditworthiness.

5. Credit Information.  Your account is being established without credit information being obtained.  We will not report this account to any credit reporting agency until after you reach the age of 18 or unless you are currently age 18.

6. Monthly Payment.  We will mail you a statement every month showing your Previous Balance of purchases and cash advances for the VISA Credit Card and or withdrawals for VISA Debit Card, the current transactions on your account, the remaining credit available under your Credit Line, the New Balances of purchases Student VISA Platinum credit Card cash advances and VISA Debit withdrawals, the Total New Balance, the FINANCE CHARGE, any other billed fees, and the Minimum Payment required. Your statement will show the required payment you must make for that statement and the date it is due.  By separate agreement you may authorize us to charge the minimum payment automatically to your Share Savings or Checking Account with us.  You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment or pay the Total New Balance in full, and you will reduce the FINANCE CHARGE by so doing.

	a. VISA Credit Card Monthly Payment. Every month you must pay at least the Minimum Payment upon receipt of your statement. The Minimum Payment will be either (a) 3% of your Total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater; or (b) your Total New Balance, if it is less than $25.00, plus any portion of the Minimum Payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid.  In addition, if at any time your total New Balance exceeds your Credit Line, you must immediately pay the excess amount.  We will apply your payments first to the FINANCE CHARGE on both purchases and cash advances, then to any billed fees, then to the principal balance of purchases and cash advances.

b. VISA Debit Card Monthly Payment.  The Minimum Payment will be either (a) 3% of your Total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater; or (b) your Total New Balance, if it is less than $25.00, plus any portion of the Minimum Payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid.  In addition, at any time your total New Balance exceeds your Line of Credit, you must immediately pay the excess amount. We will apply your payments first to the FINANCE CHARGE on both purchases and withdrawals, then to any billed fees, then to the principal balance of purchases and withdrawals. 

7. Finance Charges.  
     a. VISA Credit Card.  You can avoid FINANCE CHARGES on purchases by paying the statement balance in full each month within 25 days of the statement closing date.  If you pay part of the purchases included in the statement balance within 25 days of the statement closing date, FINANCE CHARGES will not apply to the amount paid. However, cash advance fees may still apply.  If the payment due date falls on a non-business day, payment must be received by the last business day prior to the due date.
     You may be subject to a fixed rate or variable rate of interest.  The applicable rate will be disclosed to you on your Disclosure Statement and monthly statements.  Interest is calculated by multiplying the applicable daily interest rate times the average daily balance of purchases and cash advances.  The daily interest rate is calculated by dividing the applicable rate by 365.  The principal balances of purchases and cash advances are determined each date during the statement period beginning with the principal portion of your Previous Balances, reduced by payments you make and credits we apply, and increased by purchases and cash advances you make and debit adjustments we make during the statement period.  The daily principal balances are totaled and divided by the number of days in the statement period.  This produces separate average daily principal balances for purchases and cash advances to which the daily periodic rate is applied.  The variable rate is the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate published on the last day of the month plus a margin.  The margin for the VISA Platinum and VISA Platinum Plus is based on your credit risk and will be disclosed to you on your Disclosure Statement.  The maximum variable ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is the highest legal rate.  The maximum increase or decrease your rate can change per calendar year is 3.0%.
	
	b. VISA Debit Card. Your interest is calculated by multiplying the applicable daily rate times the average daily balance of purchases and withdrawals.  The fixed rate is 12.90%. The daily rate is calculated by dividing the applicable rate by 365.  The principal balances of purchases and withdrawals are determined each day during the statement period, beginning with the principal portion of your Previous Balances, reduced by payments you make and debit adjustments we make during the statement period. 

8. Default.  You will be in default if you fail to make any Minimum Payment within 10 days after your statement due date.  You will also be in default if your ability to repay us is materially reduced, you are a debtor in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, you pass away, you fail to abide by this Agreement or if the value of our security interest materially declines.  We have the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance if you default.  To the extent permitted by law, you will also be required to pay our collection expenses, including court costs and reasonable attorneys� fees.

9. Using the Card.  To make a purchase or cash advance, there are several methods for use of the Card.  You may present the Card to a participating VISA plan merchant, to us, or to another financial institution. You may complete the transaction by using your Personal Identification Number (PIN) in conjunction with the Card in an Automated Teller Machine or other type of electronic terminal that provides access to the VISA system. You may provide your VISA Card information to merchants either by phone or by mail. The monthly statement will identify the merchant, electronic terminal, or financial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advance, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. The Credit Union may make a reasonable charge for photo copies of documents you request.

10. Returns and Adjustments.
	a. VISA Credit Card.  Merchants and others who honor the Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending us a credit slip which we will post to your account.

	b. VISA Debit Card.  Merchants and others who honor the Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending us a credit slip which we will post to your Checking Account.

11. Foreign Transactions.  Purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. Dollars.  The conversion rate will be made in accordance with the operating regulations for international transactions established by VISA International, Inc.  VISA has the right to assess a Foreign Conversion Fee.  This fee could be up to 1.5% of the transaction amount

12. Plan Merchant Disputes.  We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor your Card.  We are subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods and services you purchase with the Card only if you have made a good faith attempt, but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant, and: (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement we sent or participated in sending you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made from a plan merchant in your state or within 100 miles of your home.

2. 
Credit Limit: We will provide you notice of your credit limit when we send you your Card, and it will also be listed on each Billing Statement we send you. At our discretion, we may change your limit at any time as permitted by law and after providing you with appropriate notice as required. We do not automatically increase your credit limit if you make a payment that results in your Account having a credit balance. You may request a change to your credit limit by contacting the Bank at the toll free number listed on the back of your Card and on your Statement. We do not have to pay any Convenience Check or honor any cash advance or purchase with your Card that puts your Account balance over your credit limit. You agree not to exceed your credit limit, but if you do, and we pay or accept any Checks, advances or purchases that put your unpaid Account balance over your credit limit, you promise to pay these amounts without our notice or demand. 

3.	
Additional Cards and Convenience Checks: You may request additional Cards on your Account for yourself or for one or more Authorized Users by contacting the Bank at the toll free number listed on the back of your Card and on your Statement. You are responsible for your Authorized User�s use of the Card. If you want to remove an Authorized User from the Account your must 


F03-J407-1 (6/10) 
contact us at the number provided on your Statement and destroy all Cards in his or her possession. Authorized Users may remove themselves from the Account upon request. From time to time, we may provide you with Convenience Checks to access your Account that you can use like any other personal checks except they cannot be used to make payments to us under this Account or, without our written consent, to pay any other amount you owe us. Purchases made via Convenience Checks are treated as cash advances for the purpose of calculating Interest Charges. 

4.	
Card Use: You or an Authorized User on your Account must sign your Card in order to use it. You may use your Card to buy goods and services from Merchants or to borrow cash from us at one of our branches or at other banks where the Card is honored up to the credit limit we establish for you. You must follow any and all reasonable and proper procedures required by us or the other bank or Merchant honoring the Card. 

5.	
Transaction Limitations/Suspensions: There is no minimum dollar amount for Card purchases; however, there is a $50 minimum on cash advances. At our discretion, we may limit the number of transactions that may be approved in any one day. If we detect unusual or suspicious activity on your Account, we may temporarily suspend your credit privileges until we can verify the activity. We are not responsible if a transaction on your Account is not approved, either by us or by a third party, even if you have sufficient credit available. We may, in our discretion, approve transactions that cause your balance to exceed your credit limit without waiving any of our rights under this Agreement. 

6.	
Finance Charges: The total Finance Charge imposed on your Account each Billing Cycle is the sum of the Interest Charges plus all Transaction Fees imposed during that Billing Cycle. 


(a) Interest Charges 
� 
Interest Charges on Goods and Services Purchased by Card: We will impose no Interest Charge to your Account if we credit you for payment of the entire New Balance shown on your Statement by the Payment Due Date. If your payment is not credited to your Account by the Payment Due Date (see Section 11), or you do not pay your New Balance in full, we will impose an Interest Charge on the average daily balance outstanding on your Account for the number of days in your Billing Cycle. 

� 
Interest Charges on Cash Advances and Balance Transfers: We will impose an Interest Charge for your cash advances (whether they are obtained by Check or Card), including any balances you transfer, from the date of the cash advance or the date the balance transfer posts. 

� 
Calculation of Average Daily Balance(s): We use the average daily balance method (including current transactions) for calculating your average daily balance(s). We will determine an average daily balance for (1) each of your purchase balances, and (2) each of your cash advance (including balance transfers) balances. To get the daily balance for your purchase and cash advance (including balance transfer) amounts, we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchase, cash advance and balance transfer amounts, as applicable, add any new charges and fees, subtract any applicable portions of payments and credits, and add applicable unpaid Interest Charges from the application of the daily periodic rate to each day�s ending balance. 

� 
Calculation of Your Interest Charge: Your Interest Charge for the period is based on the applicable Annual Percentage Rate (APR) associated with each balance. We disclose the currently effective APR in our Pricing Information Disclosure, which is part of this Agreement and is included with our letter to you advising you that your Account has been approved. Portions of your Balance, however, may be subject to prior APRs. We calculate Interest Charges separately for your purchase and cash advance (including balance transfer) balances under each applicable APR. We list each balance and the applicable interest rate in the Interest Charge Calculation section of your Statement. We compute each Interest Charge by: 

(1) 
calculating the daily periodic rate, 

(2) 
multiplying the average daily balance for each balance by the applicable daily periodic rate (which is based on the APR applied to that balance), 

(3) 
multiplying each of the products in (2) by the number of days in the Billing Cycle, and 

(4) 
adding together all the products obtained in (3) to obtain your Total Interest for the period. 




(b) Transaction Fees: You will pay additional Finance Charges, called �Transaction Fees,� if incurred. A description of these fees is included below; however, the actual fee for these transactions is listed in our Pricing Information Disclosure at the end of this Agreement. In the first Billing Cycle in which a Transaction Fee is posted, the Transaction Fee may cause the APR shown on your Statement for that Billing Cycle to exceed the nominal APR. 
� Foreign Transaction (Foreign Currency Conversion) Fee. MasterCard International, Inc. or Visa International, as applicable, will convert any charges you incur in currency other than U.S. dollars into a U.S. dollar amount under the currency conversion procedures set forth in their respective Operating Regulations in effect at the time the transaction is processed. The non-U.S. dollar transaction amount is converted into a U.S. dollar amount by multiplying the transaction amount in the non-U.S. dollar currency by a currency conversion or exchange rate. The currency conversion rate is either (1) a government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable processing date; or, 
(2) for MasterCard, a wholesale rate provided to MasterCard for the applicable processing date; or, (3) for Visa, a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives. The currency conversion rate is determined as of the date the transaction is processed and may differ from the rate in effect on the date the transaction occurred or posted to your account. Both MasterCard and Visa charge us, as the processing bank, a percentage of the transaction amount. The fee we charge you for foreign currency conversions is contained in our Pricing Information Disclosure at the end of this Agreement. 
� 
Cash Advance Fee. We charge you a fee for cash advances you make. For purposes of the imposition of Cash Advance Fees, the term �cash advance� means a cash advance loan made to you or on your behalf through the use of a Card, but does not include purchases, the use of Checks, or balance transfers to your Account from credit card accounts you maintained at other financial institutions. See your Pricing Information Disclosure at the end of this Agreement for the amount of the fee. 

� 
Balance Transfer Fee. We do not charge a Balance Transfer Fee. 


(c) 
Compounding of Finance Charges and Unpaid Finance Charges: Finance Charges compound daily. We will consolidate unpaid Finance Charges and other unpaid charges into your Account balance daily. In this way, unpaid Finance Charges and other unpaid charges from the previous day will be subject to and included in the calculation of the new Finance Charge. 

(d) 
Penalty Pricing: We will not increase your APR if your Account becomes delinquent; however, if your Account was already in Penalty Pricing prior to August 21, 2009, it will remain so until the Account is in non-delinquent status for three consecutive Billing Cycles, at which time the Penalty Pricing will be removed and the Account will revert to standard pricing. 



7.	
Rates: Your APR and Daily Periodic Rate are based on the highest prime rate as published in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of the month (the �Prime Rate�). Your APR and Daily Periodic Rate are subject to increase (or decrease) monthly if the Prime Rate increases or decreases. Your APR will be equal to the Prime Rate as published on the last business day of the preceding calendar month, plus a 6.9% margin. The APR will never increase above the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. An increase in the Prime Rate, which causes the APR to increase, will result in an increase in the amount of the Finance Charge. This may cause an increase in the Minimum Payment Due or cause a smaller amount of your payment of the Minimum Payment Due to be applied to principal. 

8.	
Fees: Annual Fees, if any, Transaction Fees (e.g., Balance Transfer Fees, Cash Advance Fees, Foreign Currency Conversion Fees), and Penalty Fees (e.g., any Late Payment Fee, Overlimit Fee, or Returned Payment Fee) are disclosed in our Pricing Information Disclosure at the end of this Agreement. You also agree to pay the following one-time fees if incurred: 

(a) 
Expedited Card Fee (for requests of expedited delivery of Cards): $25 

(b) 
Document Fee (for duplicate copies of Statements and copies of charge slips or other documents not requested in connection with a billing error): $5 per Statement or item 

(c) 
Expedited Delivery of Payment Fees (for rush payments): 

� 
Automated Clearing House (�ACH�) payment transfers that you initiate through a Bank customer service representative whom you contact by using the 800 telephone number listed on your Statement: $5 

� 
Payment transfers you make from one of your Bank checking or savings accounts with the assistance of a Bank Customer Contact Center representative: $2 





9.	
Changes to Rates, Fees and Terms: We may add, delete or change any term of this Agreement at any time unless the law prohibits us from doing so. We can increase your Interest Charge for new transactions and your Fees one year after your Account has been opened. We will send notice of any changes to you at the address you have given us as required by law. 

(a) 
If we increase your fees, we will inform you of your options in advance, including any right you may have to opt out of some of these changes. If you do opt out, we will close your line of credit to new purchases and cash advances, and we will not permit you to transfer balances to your Account from another credit card account. However, if you have failed to make the required Minimum Payment Due within 60 days after the Payment Due Date for that payment, you agree that any new or changed fee(s) shall apply both to existing balances and new transactions. 

(b) 
Your variable APR can go up or down monthly as the index for the rate goes up or down. If we increase your Interest Charge for any other reason, we will notify you in writing; however, we will not apply any such increase to the existing balance in your Account. 




(c) 
If the Bank has temporarily reduced your APR in connection with a hardship arrangement, we will notify you in writing when the arrangement ends and the temporary APR reverts to your prior APR. The prior APR will then apply to your outstanding balance as well as to any new transactions. 

(d) 
If you are a service member on special APR, we will notify you in writing, in accordance with federal regulations, when your APR reverts to your prior APR. The prior APR will apply to your outstanding balance as well as to any new transactions. 



10. 
Billing Statement and Notification of Billing Error: We will send you a periodic Billing Statement every month. It is your responsibility to review the Statement and notify us promptly of any charge or item you believe to be in error or subject to dispute. If you do not notify us of any disputed items within sixty (60) days after the date we send you the Statement on which the error first appears, the item(s) will be conclusively deemed as correct to the extent permitted by law. You will not receive any cancelled Checks with your Statements; however, you may obtain a photocopy of an electronic image of any Check we have in our records that you request. You may be required to pay a Document Fee for such copies. (See Section 8 for fee.). 

11. 
Payments and Late Payment Fee: You can pay off your Account balance in full each month or you can pay in monthly installments. 

(a) 
Crediting Your Payment: Payments must be made to us in U.S. dollars from a U.S. deposit account and otherwise be acceptable to us. We do not accept cash payments through the mail. We will credit your payment to your Account on the date we �receive it� as follows: 

� 
If you make your payment in person at one of our branches on a Bank business day (any day except Saturday, Sunday or a bank holiday), we will credit your payment on that day if we receive your payment prior to branch closing and you provide your payment coupon with your payment. Otherwise, crediting of your payment will be delayed. 

� 
If you make your payment by mail, we must receive it at the specific address we publish on your Billing Statement. Your payment coupon must be included with the payment. Otherwise, our receipt and crediting of your payment will be delayed. 

� 
If you make your payment at one of our ATMs on a Bank business day, we will credit your payment on that day if you make the payment prior to the ATM cutoff time for that ATM and you include your payment coupon. 

� 
If you make your payment via an electronic transfer (ACH transfer, bill pay, transfer from another account, etc.), we will credit your payment on the day that it posts to your Account. 

� 
If our crediting of your payment is delayed because your payment is mailed to the wrong address, does not meet our branch or ATM cutoff time, or does not include your payment coupon (when applicable), we will generally credit your payment to your Account the next Bank business day, but no later than 5 days after we receive it. 



(b) 
Minimum Payment Due: Your Minimum Payment Due is listed on your Statement and equals the lesser of: 

� 
the amount of your New Balance, or 

� 
the greater of: 

� 
$30, or 

� 
3% of the amount you owe, or 

�	
the sum of Finance Charges accrued since the last Billing Cycle (including Interest Charges and Transaction Fees), plus any Penalty Fees, Annual Fees (if applicable), and one-time fees that have been posted to your Account, plus 1% of the amount you owe. 








Making only the Minimum Payment Due will increase the amount of interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance. 
(c) 
Late Payment Fee: If payment of the Minimum Payment Due amount on your Account is not credited to your Account by Payment Due Date, we will charge you a Late Payment Fee unless your Minimum Payment Due is less than $30, in which case we will not assess a late Payment Fee. (See our Pricing Information Disclosure at the end of this Agreement for a description of the fee.) 

(d) 
Prepaid Status: If you pay more than the Minimum Payment Due during any particular Billing Cycle, you still must pay the Minimum Payment Due in subsequent Billing Cycles unless we notify you that you are in �prepaid status.� Your Account can achieve �prepaid status� if you pay at least twice the amount of the Minimum Payment Due but less than the New Balance, whichever is less. Your Account can be in prepaid status without a payment being required for a maximum of three consecutive months. If your Account is in prepaid status and you continue to make payments, the prepaid status will remain in effect until the prepaid amountisequal toorlessthantheMinimumPayment Due. YourAccount cannot be in prepaid status if your Account is in an adverse condition (delinquent, overlimit, etc.) or if the entire Balance is due. If you pay the New Balance in full or make a payment that is greater than the balance, your Account cannot be in a prepaid status and any existing prepaid status that may exist is cancelled. 

(e) 
Application of Payments: We apply your Minimum Payment Due amount to your lower APR balances before higher ones. We apply any portion of your payment in excess of your Minimum Payment Due to higher APR balances before lower ones. 


(f) Skip Payments: We may allow you to skip a payment during certain Billing Cycles (a �payment holiday�). If you accept a payment holiday, we will continue to apply Interest Charges but will not impose a Late Payment Fee. All credit terms and provisions contained in this Agreement (including Minimum Payment Due and any applicable Late Payment Fee) will apply for the Billing Cycle following a payment holiday. 

12. Credit Obtained by Checks: To obtain credit by using Convenience Checks, you must use the Checks we provide to you that are imprinted with your name and Account number. You are liable and responsible for all Checks written against your Account if they are signed by anyone whom you authorized to do so. We are not liable or responsible for paying postdated Checks. We are also not liable or responsible if, due to our paying a postdated Check or other Check you have asked us not to pay, other Checks are dishonored or returned unpaid. We are not liable or responsible for dishonoring and returning a Check unpaid if 
(1) 
payment of the Check would cause you to exceed your available line of credit, 

(2) 
because you are then in default under, or in breach of the terms of this Agreement, or (3) because your privileges under this Agreement have been revoked. If, however, we pay any Check in our discretion that we could have properly dishonored or returned unpaid for any reason (including the above reasons), then you, nevertheless, agree to pay the amount of the Check. Payment of a Check shall not constitute our waiver of amounts due and unpaid at that time. 



13. 
Ownership of Checks and Cards: Cards are issued by, and are the property of, First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company. Cards and related Convenience Checks remain our property at all times and may be repossessed by us at any time. We may refuse to issue or reissue you a Card or Checks, revoke your Card or limit Card use, and/or revoke your privileges relating to the use of Checks, without your knowledge and without notice to you. If we revoke your Card or withdraw your privilege to use any Checks, and you become aware of such revocation/withdrawal, you must surrender to us or our agent the Card, the Checks, and any other cards or devices that may be used to access the Account. You must not use any expired, revoked or otherwise invalid Card or Checks to obtain, or attempt to obtain, credit. You must not use the Card, Checks and/or the Account for any illegal transactions. 

14. 
Responsibility for Charges to Your Account: We may charge your Account for any transaction authorized either by you or by any Authorized User. Valid authorization for a transaction may be given (1) in writing (e.g., by signing a sales slip or cash advance slip), (2) verbally (e.g., by telephone), or (3) electronically (e.g., over the Internet). If you or any Authorized User gives your Account number to any third party who uses that information to initiate a charge against your Account, we will consider the transaction authorized by you. 

15. 
Refusal to Honor Card or Checks; Adjustments: We are not responsible if a Merchant refuses to honor your Card or Checks. If your Account requires an adjustment for goods or services purchased (a return), we will make the adjustment only to your Account and only upon our receipt of a properly executed credit slip. You agree not to accept any cash refunds with respect to any adjustments for goods or services purchased. 

16. 
Default: 

(a) 
Each of the following constitutes an event of default: 

� 
Your failure to make any payment when due and payable. 

� 
Your failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement relating to other cards or devices that access your Account. 

� 
Your death or insolvency, or your making an assignment for the benefit of creditors. 

� 
The filing of a petition or commencement of any other proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership law by or against you. 

� 
Issuance of any writ, order or notice of attachment, levy or garnishment against you or any of your property, assets or income. 

� 
The occurrence of an event that gives us reason to believe that your ability to pay us on time has been impaired, or that you may use your Card or Checks improperly. 



(b) 
Our rights in the event of default: We may, at our option and after giving you all legally required notices and rights to cure, declare all amounts you owe us immediately due and payable with interest at the rate provided in this Agreement. If this occurs, you agree to pay us, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all costs of collection, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys� fees and expenses. Any such attorneys� fees will be added to the unpaid Balance on your Account and interest will be charged on this amount at the rate provided in this Agreement. We also have the right to cancel the Agreement and take immediate possession of all Cards and Checks. 



17. 
Investigating Your Credit; Reporting Your Credit History: You authorize us, at any time we feel appropriate, to obtain or conduct whatever credit investigation we feel is needed to evaluate your credit, personal or financial standing, and/or employment. Upon our request, you agree to provide us with your current financial information. You also authorize us to report information about your Account to consumer (credit) reporting agencies, and share your credit experience, including information on late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your Account, with consumer reporting agencies, creditors and any others. This information may be reflected in your credit report. 


18. 
Contacting You: You expressly authorize us, our affiliates, our agents, and any independent contractors we hire to contact you in person or by using an automated device or prerecorded messaging system or any other way at any telephone number or other electronic device or devices we or our affiliates or agents believe will or may connect us/them with you including, but not limited to (1) cell phone numbers you have given to us or we may acquire by any other means, (2) text messaging, (3) email",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

and ""ours"" means this Credit Union. 

Responsibility 

If we issue you a card, you agree to repay all debts and the Interest 
Charge arising from the use of the card and the card account. For 
example, you are responsible for charges made by anyone else to whom 
you give the card, and this responsibility continues until the card is 
recovered. You cannot disclaim responsibility by notifying us, but we will 
close the account for new transactions if you so request and return all 
cards. Your obligation to pay the account balance continues even though 
an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment in which we are not 
a party may direct you or one of the other persons responsible to pay the 
account. Any person using the card is jointly responsible with you for 
charges he or she makes, but if that person signs the card he or she 
becomes a party to this Agreement and is also jointly responsible for all 
charges on the account, including yours. 

Authorized Signer: Anyone who uses your credit cards with your 
permission. More specifically, someone who has a credit card from your 
account with their name on it. An authorized user is not legally responsible 
for the debt and cannot receive information regarding the account. 

Joint Account: An account shared by two or more people. Each person 
on the account is legally responsible for the debt and the account will be 
reported to each person's credit report. 

If Your Card is Lost or Stolen or if an Unauthorized Use Occurs 

You agree to notify us immediately if your card is ever lost or stolen or if an 
unauthorized use may have occurred. The telephone number to call during 
regular credit union business hours is (800) 562-0999 and (866) 861-5416 
on weekends or after business hours. You agree to follow up your call with 
notice in writing to us at: Washington State Employees Credit Union, P.O. 
Box WSECU, Olympia, WA 98507. You also agree to assist us in 
determining the facts, circumstances and other pertinent information 
relating to any loss, theft or possible unauthorized use of your credit card 
and comply with such procedures as we may require in connection with 
our investigation, including assisting in the prosecution of any 
unauthorized user. You will be liable for any unauthorized use only if we 
can prove that you were grossly negligent in your use or handling of your 
Credit Card, or if we can prove that you used your Credit Card fraudulently. 

Using the Card 

You may use the card issued to you to make purchases in person, by mail, 
by telephone, or by internet from merchants and others who accept VISA 
credit cards. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit 
Union, from other financial institutions participating in the VISA program 
and from ATMs (automated teller machines) that participate in the ATM 
VISA program. You will need to use your PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION 
NUMBER (PIN) to obtain a cash advance from an ATM. 

Rebate on Purchases (Gold Rebate Only) 

The Credit Union will credit to the Account an amount equal to one percent 
of purchases minus any credits in the statement cycle. The Credit Union 
reserves the right to suspend the rebate credit at any time upon any 
breach of the Agreement. No rebate credit will be made for any cash 
advance or balance transfer transaction. The rebate credit will not affect 
any minimum monthly payment requirement. 

Illegal Use and Internet Gambling 

You agree that all transactions that you initiate by use of your VISA Credit 
Card are legal in the jurisdiction where you live and/or where the 
transaction occurred. Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in 
which you are located, including the United States. You may not use the 
card or account for any illegal or unlawful purpose, and we may decline to 
authorize any transaction that we believe may be illegal or unlawful. 
Display of a payment card logo by an online merchant does not mean that 
internet gambling transactions are lawful in all jurisdictions in which you 
may be located. You agree to repay according to the terms of this 
Agreement all transactions you initiate by use of your Credit Card, whether 
deemed legal or illegal. 

Credit Union Business Days 

The Credit Union's business days are Monday -Friday, excluding holidays. 
Business hours are Monday - Friday 7:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. 

Credit Line 

If we approve your application, we will establish a self-replenishing Line of 
Credit for you and notify you of its amount when we issue the card. You agree 
not to let the account balance exceed this approved Credit Line. Each payment 
you make on the account will restore your Credit Line by the amount of the 
payment which is applied to principal. You may request an increase in your 
Credit Line only by written application to us, which must be approved by our 
credit committee or loan officer. By giving you written notice our credit 
committee may reduce your Credit Line from time to time, or with good cause, 
revoke your card and terminate this Agreement. Good cause includes your 
failure to comply with this Agreement, or our adverse reevaluation of your 
creditworthiness. You may also terminate this Agreement at any time, but 
termination by either of us does not affect your obligation to pay the account 
balance. The cards remain our property and you must recover and surrender to 
us all cards upon our request and upon termination of this Agreement. 

Monthly Payment 

We will mail you a statement every month showing your previous balances of 
purchases and cash advances, the current transactions on your account, the 
remaining credit available under your credit line, the new balances of purchases 
and cash advances, the total new balance, the Interest Charge due to date, and 
the minimum payment required. Every month you must pay at least the 
minimum payment by the due date indicated on your statement. If late, we will 
assess, and you will pay a late payment fee as disclosed to you on your Visa 
Disclosures, or as amended. You may, of course, pay more frequently, pay more 
than the minimum payment, or pay the total new balance in full, and you will 
reduce the Interest Charge by doing so. The minimum payment will be 2.5% of 
your New Balance rounded to the nearest dollar, or $25.00. If your outstanding 
balance is $25.00 or less you agree to pay the balance in full, plus any portion 
of the minimum payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid. 
In addition, at any time your total new balance exceeds your credit line, you 
must immediately pay the excess upon our demand. We may accept checks 
marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of our 
rights to collect the full balance of your account with us. 

Credit Information 

You authorized us to investigate your credit standing when opening, renewing or 
reviewing your account, and you authorize us to disclose information regarding 
your account to credit bureaus and other creditors who inquire of us about your 
credit standing, to the extent authorized in our By-Laws. 

Interest Charges 

You can avoid Interest Charges on purchases by paying the full amount of the 
New Balance of Purchases each month on or before your payment due date. 
Otherwise, the New Balance of Purchases, and subsequent purchases from the 
date they are posted to your account, will be subject to an Interest Charge. 
Cash Advances and Balance Transfers - An Interest Charge will be imposed on 
cash advances and balance transfers from the date each cash advance or 
balance transfer is made. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid a 
periodic Interest Charge on cash advances or balance transfers. In addition to 
the Interest Charge imposed by applying the periodic rate, a cash advance fee 
(Interest Charge) equal to the lesser of 2% of the cash advance amount or 
$25.00 will be imposed on each cash advance. An Interest Charge is calculated 
at the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE disclosed to you on your Visa 
Disclosures or as amended on the average daily principal balance of purchases, 
cash advances or balance transfers you make and debit adjustments the credit 
union makes during the statement period. The daily principal balances are 
totaled, and divided by the number of days in the statement period to produce 
separate average daily principal balances for purchases, cash advances, and 
balance transfers to which the periodic rate is then applied.

In this Agreement the words ""you"" and ""your"" mean each and all of those who apply for the card or who sign this Agreement and everyone who receives, signs or uses a card issued 
under this account. ""Card"" means the VISA Credit Card and any duplicates and renewals we issue. ""Account"" means your VISA Credit Card Line of Credit account with us. ""We"", ""us""

Other Charges 

Your account will be subject to other charges as disclosed to you on your 
Visa Disclosures or as amended. These charges may be changed by us 
from time to time in accordance with applicable law. 

Default 

You may be in default if you fail to make any Minimum Payment on or 
before your payment due date. You will also be in default if your ability to 
repay the credit union is materially reduced by a change in your 
employment, an increase in your obligations, bankruptcy or insolvency 
proceedings involving you, your death, or your failure to abide by this 
Agreement, or if the value of the credit union's security interest materially 
declines. The Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of 
your full account balance if you default, subject to the credit union giving 
you any notice required by law. To the extent permitted by law, you will 
also be required to pay the Credit Union's collection expenses, including 
court costs and reasonable attorney's fees. 

Returns, Adjustments, and Overpayment 

Merchants and others who honor the credit card may give credit for 
returns or adjustments, and they will do so by submitting a credit voucher 
which will post to your account. If your credit voucher and/or payments 
exceed what you owe us, we will post the credit balance to your credit 
card. If the credit stays on your account for 60 days or more the funds will 
be transferred to your share account. WSECU will not accept 
overpayment to inflate the credit limit. 

Foreign Transactions 

Purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign 
currencies will be billed to you in U.S. Dollars. Transactions processed 
outside of the United States will be charged a foreign transaction fee in an 
amount to be determined by the Credit Union, regardless of whether there 
is a currency conversion associated with the transaction. The conversion 
exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency 
used for processing international transactions to U. S. Dollars will be from 
a range of rates which may vary selected by VISA USA from the wholesale 
currency market rate or the government mandated rate in effect for the 
applicable Central Processing Date (CPD), in each instance, plus or minus 
any adjustment determined by the Credit Union as a VISA Issuer. A VISA 
International Service Assessment (ISA) Fee will be billed to you separately 
as the Foreign Currency Conversion Fee on all cross border transactions. 
A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant 
completes on your card outside of the U.S., Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin 
Islands; this may include internet transactions. 

Plan Merchant Disputes 

We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial 
institution to honor your card. We are subject to claims and defenses other 
than tort claims arising out of goods or services you purchase with the 
card only if you have made a good faith attempt, but have been unable to 
obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant, and: (a) your purchase was 
made in response to an advertisement we sent or participated in sending 
you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50 and was made from a plan 
merchant in your state or within 100 miles of your home. Any other 
disputes you must resolve directly with the plan merchant. 

Security Interest 

To secure your account, you grant us a purchase money security interest 
under the Uniform Commercial Code in any goods you purchase through 
the account. If you default, we will have the right to recover any of those 
goods which have not been paid for through our application of your 
payment in the manner described in the Monthly Payment section on page 
1 of this document. With respect to this account only, we will not assert 
any statutory right we may have if you are in default to prevent withdrawal 
of your unpledged Credit Union shares (deposits) below the unpaid 
balance of your account. 

Pledge of Share Account(s) -Note: You pledge to grant a security 
interest in all joint and individual accounts you have with us now and in 
the future to secure your credit card account. You authorize us to apply 
the balance in these account(s) to pay any amounts due under this 
agreement if you should default. 

Cross-Collateralization 

Your account is also secured by any and all property that you have given as 
security or may give as security in the future under any other credit or loan 
agreements or security agreements with us. The terms and conditions of those 
credit or loan agreements and security agreements are hereby incorporated into 
this VISA Credit Card Agreement as if fully set forth herein. 

Effect of Agreement 

This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account 
even though the sales, cash advance, credit or other slips you sign or receive 
may contain different terms. Subject to applicable law, we may amend this 
Agreement from time to time by sending you the advance written notice required 
by law. Your use of the card thereafter will indicate your agreement to the 
amendments. To the extent the law permits, and we indicate in our notice, 
amendments will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future 
transactions. 

No Waiver 

The Credit Union can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times 
without losing the ability to exercise those rights in the future. 

Statements and Notices 

Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the most recent address you 
have given the Credit Union. Notices sent to any one of you will be considered 
notice to all. 

Final Expression 

This Agreement is the final expression of the terms and conditions of this VISA 
line of credit between you and the Credit Union. This written Agreement may not 
be contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement. 

Record Keeping 

You hereby agree that the credit union may keep the portion of the Agreement 
which bears your signature so we can comply with federal and/or state law 
relating to loan documents the credit union is required to keep in its file. 

Non-Transferability 

I agree that my account(s) are not assignable or transferable except to the 
Credit Union unless specifically authorized in writing by you. 

No Liability for Dishonor 

The Credit Union will not have any responsibility or liability to me or others 
relating to the dishonor or other return of any check, draft, ACH transaction or 
other order occurring as a result of you exercising your lien rights or freezing 
any accounts in order to protect or preserve such rights.

payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be 
reflected in your credit report.

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS: KEEP THIS DOCUMENT FOR FUTURE USE 

This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under 
the Fair Credit Billing Act. 

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement 

If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at the address(es) 
listed on your statement. 
In your letter, give us the following information: 


1. 
Your name and account number. 
2. 
The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
3. 
If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is 
wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. 
You must contact us: 
-Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. 
-At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if 


you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. 
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if 
you do, we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may 
have to pay the amount in question. 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 
When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 

1. 
Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received 
your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 
2. 
Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or 
explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. 
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 

-We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as 
delinquent on that amount. 
-The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may 
continue to charge you interest on that amount. 
-While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are 
responsible for the remainder of your balance. 
-We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 

-If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or 
any interest or other fees related to that amount. 

-If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the 
amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send 
you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. 
We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we 
think you owe. 

If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must 
write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, 
we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are 
questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we 
reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when 
the matter has been settled between us. 
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 
of the amount you question even if your bill is correct. 

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases 

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased 
with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem 
with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount 
due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true: 

1. 
The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 
miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have 
been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your 
purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own 
the company that sold you the goods or services.) 
2. 
You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made 
with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your 
credit card account do not qualify. 
3. 
You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the 
purchase, contact us in writing at the address(es) listed on your statement. 
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as 

discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our 
decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, 
we may report you as delinquent.

ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES (APRs):  Your APRs will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.  Your monthly periodic rates and corresponding APRs may increase or decrease if the Prime Rate changes.  Changes in the Prime Rate will apply to your entire Account balance, will take effect on the first day of the billing period following the change and may result in increases or decreases in the amount of interest, minimum payments and/or number of payments.

	The Rates for Purchases are:
		Prime Rate plus 4% to Prime Rate plus 9.5%
		Current Periodic Rates (as of 6/30/10):  0.604% to 1.063%
			Corresponding APRs (as of 6/30/10):  7.25% to 12.75%

INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION FEE:  3% of transaction amount

PAYING INTEREST:  Except as provided below, Purchases, Advances and Balance Transfers begin to accrue interest from the date of the transaction (or, at our option, from the date they are posted to your Account) and continue to accrue interest until the charge is paid in full.  You will have at least a 25 day grace period (Grace Period) on Purchases.  This means you have at least 25 days from the closing date on your monthly statement to pay for new Purchases before we charge interest on them.  However, the Grace Period will apply only in billing periods when (1) you paid the previous balance in full or (2) you had a previous balance of $0.00 or a credit balance.  (The previous balance is the balance identified as the New Balance on the monthly statement for the previous billing period.)  When the Grace Period applies, we will not impose interest on (1) any new Purchases if we receive the full New Balance on the monthly statement for that billing period by the due date shown on that statement or (2) the portion of the Purchase balance repaid if we receive only part of the New Balance by the due date.  There is no grace period within which you can avoid interest on Advances or Balance Transfers.

BALANCE COMPUTATION METHOD:  We figure the interest on your Account by applying the applicable monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of your Account (including current transactions).  To get the average daily balance, we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new Purchases, Advances or fees, and subtract any payments and credits and unpaid interest.  This gives us the daily balance.  Then, we add up the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period.  This gives us the average daily balance.

TRANSACTION FEE FOR CASH ADVANCES:  3% of each advance (minimum $5)

LATE PAYMENT FEE:  $15 for a balance up to $99.99; $29 for a balance of $100 to $999.99; or $39 for a balance of $1,000 or more

RETURNED PAYMENT FEE:  $25

Subject to the limitations of applicable law, we may at any time change, add to or delete any of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, interest rates and fees and this Changing This Agreement section.  Such changes may be based, in whole or in part, upon factors including, but not limited to, anti-fraud policies and procedures, your record of making timely payments and staying within the established Credit Limit on your Account with us, or your credit score and information contained in your credit report.  We will give you notice of any change, addition or deletion as required by applicable law.  As of the effective date, the changed terms, at our option, will apply to new Purchases, Advances and Balance Transfers and to the outstanding balances of your Account, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

CREDIT LIMIT.  We will grant you credit up to a maximum amount (your Credit Limit).  You will be informed of your initial Credit Limit when you receive your Card.  Your current Credit Limit will be shown on each monthly statement.  You promise not to exceed your Credit Limit.  However, if you exceed your Credit Limit, we can still charge you for all Purchases, Advances, Balance Transfers, interest and fees without giving up any of our rights.  At our discretion, we may change your Credit Limit at any time without advance notice to you.

USE OF ACCOUNT.  You may use your Account to make Purchases, Advances and Balance Transfers as described below.  Any use of your Account number will be considered to be a use of the Card.  Please sign the Card before you use it.  The Card is our property.  You must return it to us or our agent upon request.

	1.	Purchases.  You may use your Card at participating merchants to purchase goods and services (Purchases).

	2.	Advances.  You may use your Card or Account to obtain cash loans (Advances) from an authorized automated teller machine (ATM), bank or others who agree to accept your Card.  To obtain Advances at authorized ATMs, you must request and use a personal identification number (PIN).  You agree to keep your PIN confidential and not write it on or leave it near your Card.  ATM Cash Advance limitations and charges are shown on the Account Disclosures Insert and also are available upon request.

You may use your Card or Account to transfer balances from other credit card accounts to this Account (Balance Transfers) by means (including balance transfer forms) we may make available from time to time.  Balance Transfers will be treated as Cash Advances unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or any applicable balance transfer offer.  You may not transfer balances from any other account you have with us.

PROMISE TO PAY.  When you use your Account or permit someone else to use it, you promise to pay the total amount of all Purchases, Advances and Balance Transfers as well as any interest or fees that may be due under the terms of this Agreement.  If your Account is a joint Account, all of you are bound by this Agreement and each of you jointly and individually promises to pay all amounts owed to us for transactions made by any joint Account holder.

MONTHLY STATEMENT.  We will send you a monthly statement for any billing period in which there is activity on your Account, or as otherwise required by applicable law.  Your monthly statement will show, among other things, (1) the unpaid balance on your Account at the beginning of the billing period (the New Balance); (2) any Purchases, Advances, Balance Transfers, interest, fees and other debits posted to your Account in that billing period; (3) any payments and credits posted to your Account in that billing period; and (4) the minimum payment you must pay and the date your minimum payment is due (approximately 25 days after the billing date on your monthly statement).  We will send the monthly statement to the address specified on your Application or to the address you designate from time to time.  If this is a joint Account, each of you appoints the other as his or her agent to designate the address to which we may send your monthly statements and any other notices.

PAYMENTS.

	1.	Minimum Payment; Application of Payments.  You must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your monthly statement each billing period.  If the New Balance is more than $15, the minimum payment is $15 or 2.5% of the New Balance, whichever is greater.  The minimum payment will be rounded to the nearest dollar.  If the New Balance is less than $15, the total New Balance is due.  Any amounts past due or in excess of your Credit Limit will also be added to the minimum payment.  Payment for more than the minimum amount due will be accepted as a single payment for that month.  Any amount over the minimum is not applicable to future amounts due.  In accordance with applicable law, we will choose the order in which payments are applied to your Account.

	2.	Skip Payment Options (If You Have A Union Credit Card).  We may allow you to skip one or more minimum payments if one of the following options is applicable to your Account.  Interest will continue to accrue on any unpaid balance in any billing period in which you skip a minimum payment, but no Late Payment Fee will be imposed on your Account.  An election to skip payments under either option may lengthen the period over which your Account balance must be paid.

		a.	Strike Skip Payment:  You may skip the minimum payment for those months when you are on strike if (1) the strike lasts for at least 30 days and is sanctioned by your Union and (2) your Union notifies us that you qualify for the Strike Skip Payment.

		b.	No-Pay Option Months:  If your Union has chosen no-pay option months, you may skip the minimum payment in those months.

	3.	Making Payments.  All payments must be in U.S. dollars.  All checks must be drawn on funds on deposit in the United States.  Mail your payment to the address shown on your monthly statement.  Your payment will be credited as of the date of receipt by us only if received by 5:00 p.m. (Central Standard Time).  Any payments received after this time will be deemed received by us on the next business day.  Payments made at any location other than the address shown on your monthly statement could be subject to a delay in crediting.  With your payment, include your payment coupon, which is a portion of your monthly statement.  If you do not include your payment coupon, credit to your Account may be delayed.  Delayed crediting may cause you to incur a Late Payment Fee or additional interest.  Do not send us cash.  

	4.	Disputed Payments.  You agree not to send us payments marked paid in full, without recourse or with similar language.  If you send such a payment, we may accept it without losing any of our rights under this Agreement.  All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes payment in full of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, must be mailed or delivered to Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, One West Monroe Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603, Attn: Credit Card Disputed Payments. 

OTHER FEES.  Subject to limitations and requirements of applicable law, you agree to pay the following fees:

	a.	If applicable, an Annual Fee, which will be billed on your first monthly statement and thereafter on the anniversary date of your Account until your Account is terminated or cancelled;

	b.	A Late Payment Fee based on your Account balance contained on your most recent statement if you have not made the required monthly payment by the statement due date;

	c.	A Transaction Fee for each Advance, including Balance Transfers;

	d.	A Returned Payment Fee for any payment that is returned unpaid by your financial institution;

	e.	An International Transaction Fee for each transaction made outside the U.S., including returns;

	f.	A Credit Limit Increase Fee if we approve your request for a same-day Credit Limit increase;

	g.	A Copy Fee for each additional copy of a monthly statement we provide at your request; and

	h.	A Replacement Card Fee for the second and any subsequent replacement Card we provide at your request within a 12 month period.

The specific amounts of these fees and any additional terms or conditions related to these fees are shown on the Account Disclosures Insert.

INTEREST.  The monthly periodic rates used to calculate interest on your Account and the corresponding Annual Percentage Rate (APRs), which depend on the type of Card you have (such as Union, Standard or Gold), are set forth on the Account Disclosures Insert.  The monthly periodic rates and corresponding APRs for each billing period will vary with the market based on the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal on the last business day of the preceding month (the Prime Rate).  Your monthly periodic rates and corresponding APRs may increase or decrease if the Prime Rate changes.  Changes in the Prime Rate will apply to your entire Account balance, will take effect on the first day of the billing period following the change and may result in increases or decreases in the amount of interest, minimum payments and/or number of payments.  We may select a new interest rate index if the Prime Rate is not available.

	1.	Rate for Purchases.  The monthly periodic rate for a billing period for your Purchase balance is the Prime Rate plus a Margin (set forth on the Account Disclosures Insert), divided by 12 and calculated to three decimal places and rounded up. 

	2.	Rate for Advances.  The monthly periodic rate for a billing period for your Advance balance is the Prime Rate plus a Margin (set forth on the Account Disclosures Insert), divided by 12 and calculated to three decimal places and rounded up.

BALANCE SUBJECT TO INTEREST.  We figure the interest on your Account by applying the applicable monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of your Account (including current transactions).  To get the average daily balance, we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new Purchases, Advances or fees, and subtract any payments and credits and unpaid interest.  This gives us the daily balance.  Then, we add up the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period.  This gives us the average daily balance.  

WHEN INTEREST BEGINS TO ACCRUE; GRACE PERIOD.  Except as provided below, Purchases, Advances and Balance Transfers begin to accrue interest from the date of the transaction (or, at our option, from the date they are posted to your Account) and continue to accrue interest until the charge is paid in full.  You will have at least a 25 day grace period (Grace Period) on Purchases.  This means you have at least 25 days from the closing date on your monthly statement to pay for new Purchases before we charge interest on them.  However, the Grace Period will apply only in billing periods when (1) you paid the previous balance in full or (2) you had a previous balance of $0.00 or a credit balance.  (The previous balance is the balance identified as the New Balance on the monthly statement for the previous billing period.)  When the Grace Period applies, we will not impose interest on (1) any new Purchases if we receive the full New Balance on the monthly statement for that billing period by the due date shown on that statement or (2) the portion of the Purchase balance repaid if we receive only part of the New Balance by the due date.  There is no grace period within which you can avoid interest on Advances or Balance Transfers.

AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSACTIONS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  We are not obligated to authorize any transaction (including Purchases, Advances, Balance Transfers or Credit Checks) under the following circumstances or any other circumstances which we deem necessary: (1) your Credit Limit has been exceeded or would be exceeded by the transaction; (2) you have failed to pay amounts owed to us when due or have failed to follow any terms of this Agreement; (3) you have notified us that your Card or Credit Checks have been lost or stolen or may be used by an unauthorized person; (4) your Account has been closed for any reason; or (5) your rights under this Agreement have expired or been revoked for any reason.  If, in our sole discretion, we elect to honor a transaction under any of the above circumstances, we may nevertheless charge the full amount thereof to your Account.  We are not responsible for the failure of any merchant, financial institution or other party to honor your Card or Advance request.

FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS.  The credit card association will convert any transaction in foreign currency into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate for the applicable central processing date that is (1) selected by the association from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets, which rate may vary from the rate the association receives, or (2) the government mandated rate.

DEFAULT.  Subject to limitations required by applicable law, you will be in default if (1) you fail to pay the full minimum payment on time; (2) you file for bankruptcy; (3) you break one of your promises under this Agreement; (4) you have a Union Credit Card and the Cardmember is no longer a member in good standing of the Cardmember's Union; (5) you provide us with any false, misleading, incomplete or incorrect information or signature; or (6) you die.  Upon your default, we may, subject to the limitations of applicable law and without notice: (1) reduce your Credit Limit; (2) close your Account and demand immediate payment of the entire outstanding balance and any other fees or charges that may be imposed under the terms of this Agreement; (3) bring an action to collect all amounts owed; and/or (4) take any action allowed by law.

COLLECTION COSTS.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay all costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by us in collecting or enforcing your indebtedness, whether or not a court proceeding is actually commenced.  We will bill these costs to your Account as Purchases.

OTHERS USING YOUR ACCOUNT.  You promise to pay for all transactions made by any other person you authorize to use your Account, whether or not that person exceeded your permission and whether or not you notified us that the person was using your Account.  If someone else is authorized to use your Card or Account and you want to end that person's privileges, you must let us know in writing.  If he or she has a Card, you must return that Card cut in half with your written notice.

CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT.  You may close your Account at any time by notifying us in writing and returning your Card(s) cut in half.  You remain responsible to pay the amount you owe us according to the terms of this Agreement.  We may close or suspend your Account privileges at any time and without prior notice, unless required by applicable law, for any reason we deem appropriate, including if you are in default under this Agreement.  We may also reissue a different Card at any time.  Upon request, you must destroy the Card by cutting it in half and surrendering it to us or our agent.

ADDRESSES; CHANGE OF ADDRESS.  Your full name, address and any signature on your Application are considered part of this Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement, you agree and represent that you live at the address shown on your Application or from time to time designated by you for the receipt of monthly statements.  You will notify us of any address change in writing before the change becomes effective.

DELAY IN ENFORCEMENT; NO WAIVER BY US.  We can delay enforcing or waive any of our rights under this Agreement without losing them.  If we waive a right, we do not thereby waive the same right in other situations.

ASSIGNMENT.  We can assign your Account and any of our rights under this Agreement without consent or notice to you.  Your Account, Card, this Agreement and your obligations hereunder are not transferable or assignable by you.

GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement and your Account will be governed by federal law applicable to a FDIC insured institution and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of Illinois, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.  This Agreement is entered into between you and us in Illinois and we extend credit to you from Illinois, whether or not you live in Illinois and whether or not you use your Card in Illinois.  We will make the decision whether to open an account for you and issue a Card to you from our offices in Illinois.  All payments under this Agreement are received by us in Illinois.

CREDIT REPORTS AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION.  You give us permission to request information from you and to make whatever inquiries we consider necessary and appropriate (including requesting a consumer report from consumer reporting agencies) in considering your Application and for any lawful purpose, including any updates, renewals or extensions of credit, or reviewing or collecting your Account.  Upon your request to us at Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, P.O. Box A3979, Chicago, Illinois 60690, we will inform you of the name and address of each consumer reporting agency from which we obtained a consumer report, if any, relating to you.  We may also obtain information about your credit worthiness and employment from others and may furnish information concerning your Account as well as information concerning you to consumer reporting agencies and to other proper parties.

Box A3979, Chicago, Illinois 60690.

TELEPHONE MONITORING AND CONSENT TO COMMUNICATION.  From time to time, we may monitor and/or record telephone calls regarding your Account with us to assure the quality of our service, and you agree to any such monitoring or recording.  You also agree that we may communicate with you for any lawful purpose, including collections, using (1) any electronic mail address or cell phone number that you provide to us at the time of application or in the future and/or (2) an automated telephone dialing system and/or artificial or prerecorded voice message, even if you are charged for the call under your phone plan, unless you call (800) 365 6464 to limit this consent.  No such communication will be deemed unsolicited.

LOST OR STOLEN CARDS OR CREDIT CHECKS.  If your Card or Credit Checks are lost or stolen or if you think someone may be using them without your permission, you must notify us at once by calling the telephone number on your monthly statement.  If the Card is returned to you after you have notified us, do not use the Card.  Cut it in half and return it to us.  You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us.  You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us.  In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.

The Cardmember Documents constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to your Account and supersede any other prior or contemporaneous agreement between you and us relating to your Account.

Your Billing Rights: Keep This Document For Future Use

	This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

What to Do If You Find a Mistake on Your Statement

	If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, P.O. Box A3979, Chicago, Illinois 60690.

	In your letter, give us the following information:

*	Account information: Your name and account number.

*	Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.

*	Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.

	You must contact us:

*	Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.

*	At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.

	You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter

	When we receive your letter, we must do two things:

1.	Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 

2.	Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:

*	We cannot try to collect any amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 

*	The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. 

*	While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.

*	We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:

*	If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. 

*	If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount that you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.

	If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.

	If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question, even if your bill is correct.

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases

	If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. 

	To use this right, all of the following must be true:

1.	The purchase must have made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)

2.	You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.

3.	You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

	If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at: 

	Amalgamated Bank of Chicago
	P.O. Box A3979
	Chicago, Illinois 60690

	While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

      its use, not allowing any other person to use the Card. In the event you allow another person to use the Card, you will be liable to us for such
      usage. We extend purchase credit to you on your Account when we pay the merchant on your behalf for the transaction.

      for all charge activity made until we receive notification.
            Each person receiving a Card agrees to sign the Card. Cards are not transferable and should not be given to anyone else to use.
      Additional people who desire an account should apply for their own account. You may apply for an additional Card for Authorized Users. The
      Cards are issued by us and you agree to surrender the Cards to us upon our demand. You also agree to notify us immediately if the Card is
      lost or stolen or you suspect unauthorized use of the Card.
            You promise to pay us all sums you owe on your Credit Account, along with our Interest and other charges, in accordance with this
      Contract.
 3. Using your Account to Obtain Credit: We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit the use, amount, frequency, or number of transactions
      you can make on the Card, including limiting your use of the Card at ATMs. You can use the Card and your Account to make Purchases and
      obtain Cash Advances as long as you do not exceed your Credit Limit and your Account is not closed, suspended, or exceeds authorization
      limits. When you receive your Card, you may be assigned a PIN. If a Pin is assigned to you, you can obtain a Cash Advance at any authorized
      ATM by using the Card and PIN. A Cash Advance must be greater or equal to $20.00 to be approved. Your Card cannot be used for
      illegal transactions.
4.    Your Credit Limit: Your Credit Limit appears on the Card Carrier and on your Statements. You may not exceed your Credit Limit
      at any time. However, if we choose to permit you to obtain additional credit, we may require that you pay us any amount over your
      Credit Limit immediately upon demand rather than in monthly installments and we may suspend your Account privileges or cancel
      your Account as described in Paragraph 28. Your Cash Advance limit is fifty percent (50%) of your total Credit Limit.
5.    Monthly Billing Statements: We will send you a monthly Statement at the end of each billing period. The Statements will reflect the
      account activity and our charges during the Billing Cycle. They will also show your Minimum Payment and the Payment Due Date,
      which is the date we must receive at least the Minimum Payment. If there are more than one of you living at different addresses, we
      will send the Statements only to the person named as the ""Applicant"" on the application.
6.    Payments: Payments will be credited as of the date of receipt if they are received at the address on the payment stub. We may accept
      late payments or partial payments or checks and money orders marked ""payment in full"" or similar language, without losing any of our
      rights under this Contract to receive payment in full. Payments should not be made by postdated check. If we receive payment by
      postdated check, we may deposit it and shall have no liability if it is posted prior to the date that appears on the check. We reserve
      the right to limit available credit resulting from any payment for up to fourteen (14) days. However, for security purposes, we may hold
      a payment longer. By sending your check, please be aware that you are authorizing us to use the information on your check to make
      a one-time electronic debit from your account at the financial institution indicated on your check. This electronic debit will be for the
      amount of your check; no additional amount will be added to the amount. Please contact the Customer Service Department at the
      telephone number on your Statement to learn about other payment options if you prefer to not have your check used in this way. In
      the event that your check is returned unpaid for insufficient or uncollected funds, we may represent your check electronically. In the
      ordinary course of business, your check will not be provided to you with your bank statement, but a copy can be retrieved by contacting
      your financial institution.
7.    Minimum Payment: You may pay your entire balance at any time, without penalty. Whenever a balance is due, you must pay us at
      least the Minimum Payment each month. The Minimum Payment is the sum of (i) the Monthly Payment plus (ii) all past due Monthly
      Payment amounts plus (iii) any amount your Account exceeds the Credit Limit. The Monthly Payment is the greater of: $30.00; 4%
      of your balance or Current Cycle's Interest, Late Payment Fee, and 1% of the balance. If your New Balance is less than the Minimum
      Payment, the New Balance is due in full. We must receive your payment on or before the Payment Due Date shown on the Statement.
      The Payment Due Date will be twenty-five (25) days from the Closing Date.
8.    Applying your Payments: In general, the payment will be applied in the following order: Unpaid Interest, Unpaid Fees and other
      Charges; and then principal balance. Payments applied to the principal balance will first be paid to balances at the highest Annual
      Percentage Rate (APR) and then to balances at lower APR's.
9.    Payment Methods: All payments must be made in U.S. dollars and drawn on a financial institution located in the United States.
      Payments should be made payable to Show MasterCard Credit Card. Do not send cash through the mail. Payments made through
      the mail in the form of cash or third-party checks may not be accepted.
10.   When Interest is Imposed: Interest will be imposed on Purchases only if you elect not to pay the entire New Balance shown on your
      Statement by the Payment Due Date. For Cash Advances, Interest is imposed from the date the Cash Advance is made until it is paid
      in full and there is no grace period in which you may repay a Cash Advance to avoid Interest.
11.   Average Daily Balance: We start with the Previous Balance and add purchases and cash advances as of their post dates and fees
      and charges as of the transaction dates. We subtract payments and credits as of their post dates. Then we add the daily balances
      and divide by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. To calculate the interest, we multiply the Average Daily Balance by the Monthly
      Periodic Rate. The Monthly Periodic Rate is calculated by dividing the Annual Percentage Rate disclosed in the ""Interest Rates and
      Interest Charges"" table on the back of the application by 12 (months). In any Billing Cycle when you are subject to Interest and the
      Interest as computed above is less than the minimum Interest as indicated in the ""Interest Rates and Interest Charges"" table on the
      back of the application, you will be billed the minimum Interest.
12.   Annual Percentage Rate: The Standard Annual Percentage Rate is the Prime Rate plus 18.65%. The Prime Rate is determined by
      using the ""Money Rates"" column in the Wall Street Journal on the first business day of each month, which is identified as ""The base
      rate on corporate loans at large, U.S. money center commercial banks."" If more than one ""Prime Rate"" is listed in that column, the
      largest rate listed will be used. The APR for Cash Advances is the Standard APR.
13.   Account Fees: Please see the ""Fees"" table on the back of the application for the amounts of charges applicable to your Account. Your
      account terms may or may not include all charges listed below. You agree to pay us the following other Fees, each of which will be
      billed to your Account as a Purchase and will accrue Interest:
      a. Annual Fee: We may impose an Annual Fee on your Credit Account. The Annual Fee will be charged on the first Billing Cycle and
            in about the same Billing Cycle of each following year.
      b. Cash Advance Fee: We charge a Cash Advance Fee for each Cash Advance taken on your Account through either an ATM, bank
            withdrawal or other means provided.
      c. Late Payment Fee: In every billing period in which your payment is not received by the payment due date, you will be charged a
            Late Payment Fee.
      d. Returned Payment Fee: If any check or other payment instrument is not honored for any reason by the institution on which it was
            drawn, we will impose a Returned Payment Fee.
      e. Foreign Transaction: We charge a fee for converting transactions to U.S. Dollars if made in another currency.
      f. Authorized User Fee: We will charge a fee if you request an Authorized User on your account.
14.   Other Fees: You agree to pay us the following other Fees, each of which will be billed to your Account as a Purchase and will accrue
      Interest:
      a. Express Delivery Fee: We will charge a $25.00 fee for the express delivery of your Cards sent priority two (2) day courier.
      b. Expedited Payment Fee: We will charge a $9.00 fee if you speak with a customer service representative and request that we
            expedite your payment by withdrawing funds from your checking or savings account to make a payment on your Account. We will
            process your request and post an Expedited Payment Fee to your Account.
      c. Additional Card Fee: If you authorize us to issue additional Cards on the Credit Account for you or for other Authorized Users,
            there is an Additional Card Fee imposed annually.
      d. Returned Payment Charge: If any check or other payment instrument is not honored for any reason by the institution on which it
            was drawn, we will impose a Returned Payment Charge.
      e. Copying Fee: We will charge a $5.00 per item fee if you request a duplicate of any sales draft, statement or other document. We
          will charge you for each copy we provide.
    f     Due Date Change Fee: We will charge $10.00 if you request a change in your payment due date.
    g. Replacement Card Fee: We will charge $10.00 to replace your credit card.
15. Lost or Stolen Cards: If your Card is lost or stolen, or if you believe that it is being used without your permission, you must notify us
     at (866) 205-8313, which is available 24 hours a day. You should also follow up in writing. You should not use the Account or Card
     after you have notified us. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft or possible
     unauthorized use.
16. ARBITRATION: PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. YOU AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE WILL
     BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE
     RIGHT TO A JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. IN ARBITRATION,
     A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE
     SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN COURT PROCEDURES. YOU ALSO AGREE ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE LIMITED TO
     THE DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US AND WILL NOT BE PART OF A CLASS-WIDE OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION
     PROCEEDING.
    a. Agreement to Arbitrate: You and we agree that any Dispute will be resolved by Arbitration. This agreement is governed by the
          Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 USCS � 1 et seq. and the substantive law of the State of South Dakota.
    b. Definitions: Arbitration is a means of having an independent third party resolve a Dispute. A ""Dispute"" is any controversy or
          claim between you and us. The term Dispute is to be given its broadest possible meaning and includes, without limitation, all
          claims or demands (whether past, present or future, including events that occurred prior to the opening of this Account), based
          on any legal or equitable theory (tort, contract or otherwise), and regardless of the type of relief sought (i.e. money, injunctive
          relief or declaratory relief). A Dispute includes, by way of example and without limitation, any claim based upon federal or state
          constitution, statute, ordinance, regulation, or common law, and any issue concerning the validity, enforceability or scope of this
          arbitration agreement. The term ""you"" includes any cosigner, co-obligor, guarantor, joint user or Authorized User and also your
          heirs, guardian, personal representative or trustee in bankruptcy. The term ""us"" includes our employees, officers, directors,
          attorneys, affiliated companies, predecessors and assigns, as well as our marketing, servicing and collection representatives and
          agents.
    c. Selection of Arbitrator. If a Dispute arises, the party asserting the claim or defense must initiate arbitration, provided you or we
          may first try to resolve the matter informally or through customary business methods, including collection activity. The party
          filing an arbitration may initiate and pursue the matter with the American Arbitration Association (""AAA"") or we may agree upon
          a different arbitrator described below. If you claim you have a Dispute with us, but do not initiate an arbitration or select an
          arbitrator, we may do so. You may obtain copies of the current rules of AAA and forms and instructions for initiating an arbitration
          by contacting them as follows:

                  American Arbitration Association
                  335 Madison Avenue, Floor 10
                  New York, NY 10017-4605
                  Website: www.adr.org

          The policies and procedures of the arbitrator will apply provided that they are consistent with this arbitration agreement. To the
          extent the arbitrator's rules or procedures are different than the terms of this arbitration agreement, the terms of this agreement
          shall apply. If the AAA is not available to adjudicate the matter, or if the AAA is not convenient or acceptable to you, you and we
          may agree on one or more neutral arbitrators. If you and we cannot agree on arbitrator(s), an arbitrator will be appointed by a court
          with jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to the FAA.
     d.   Cost of Arbitration: We will pay the filing fee and any costs or fees charged by the arbitrator regardless of whether you or we
          initiate the arbitration. Except where otherwise provided by applicable law, each party will be responsible for its own attorneys'
          fees and other expenses. Unless prohibited by law, the arbitrator may award fees, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the
          party who substantially prevails in the arbitration.
     e.   Place of Arbitration: Unless you and we agree to a different location, the arbitration will be held in the same city as the U.S. District
          Court closest to your then-current mailing address. The arbitrator may decide the matter based upon written submissions by the
          parties if permitted under the arbitration rules.
     f.   Waiver of Rights: You are waiving your right to a jury trial, to have a court decide your Dispute, to participate in a class action
          lawsuit and to certain discovery and other procedures that are available in a lawsuit. The arbitrator has the ability to award all
          remedies available by statute, at law or in equity to the prevailing party. You and we agree that the arbitrator has no authority to
          conduct class-wide proceedings and will be restricted to resolving the individual disputes between you and us. If an arbitration
          firm or arbitrator fails or refuses to enforce the waiver of class-wide arbitration, then the Dispute will proceed in court. The validity,
          effect and enforceability of this waiver of class action lawsuit and class-wide arbitration is to be determined solely by a court of
          competent jurisdiction and not by the arbitration firm or arbitrator. If such court refuses to enforce the class-wide arbitration waiver,
          then it is agreed the Dispute will proceed in court rather than arbitration.
     g.   Review of Arbitration Award. The arbitrator shall apply applicable federal and South Dakota substantive law and the terms of
          your agreements with us. The arbitrator shall make written findings and the arbitrator's award may be filed with any court having
          jurisdiction. The arbitration award shall be supported by substantial evidence and must be consistent with your agreements with
          us and applicable law or may be set aside by a court upon judicial review.
     h.   Other Provisions: If any portion of this arbitration agreement is subsequently deemed unenforceable, the enforceability of any
          other provision of this agreement shall not be affected and the unenforceable term shall be amended such that it is enforceable
          to the maximum extent permitted by law provided that if a class action litigation or a class-wide arbitration is permitted for any
          reason, either party may require that the entire Dispute be heard by a Judge, sitting without a jury, under applicable court rules
          and procedures. This arbitration provision shall survive: (i) termination or changes in your agreements with us, the Account, or the
          relationship between you and us concerning the Account; (ii) the bankruptcy of any party; and (iii) any transfer, sale or assignment
          of the Account, or any amounts owed on the Account, to any other person or entity.
     i.   Right to Opt-Out: If you do not wish to agree to arbitrate all Disputes with us, you must advise us in writing at the following address
          within thirty (30) days of our mailing this agreement to you at the most recent mailing address we have for you: Bryant State Bank,
          PO Box 5161, Sioux Falls, SD 57117-5161.
17. If Your Card is Refused: We are not responsible, and have no liability, if a merchant, a financial institution, an ATM or any third
    party refuses to honor your Card or accept a transaction on your Account. Although you may have the credit available, we may be
    unable to authorize credit due to operational difficulties or mistakes. The number of transactions you make, or transactions above a
    certain dollar amount, may require authorization before the transaction is approved. Neither we nor our agents will be responsible
    or have any liability if authorization for a transaction is not given. If your Account is over limit or delinquent, authorization of credit
    for transactions may be declined. All transactions, even those for which we have provided you with a receipt, are subject to our final
    verification.
18. Cardholder Privacy: We will provide you with a complete Privacy Notice on an annual basis. We may from time to time, review
    your credit, employment and income records. Your telephone calls with our service representatives may be recorded and may be
    listened to in order to evaluate the quality of customer service we provide to you. We may use automated telephone equipment or pre-
    recorded telephone calls to contact you about your Account. We may offer a variety of methods by which you can obtain information
    about your Account. Security measures cannot insure against unauthorized inquiries. You agree that we will not be responsible for
    the release of information to anyone who has gained possession of a Card or Identification Number, Credit Account Number or Social
    Security Number.
19. Calls and Text Messages to Your Cellular Phone: If you provide us with your cellular phone number or contact us from your cellular
    phone, you are providing this phone number for us, our affiliates or any third party acting on our behalf to contact you at this number.
    You agree that we may use this phone number to contact you for any business purpose related to your account and you agree to be
    responsible for any fees or charges you incur as a result of providing this information. You may request this number not be used. We
    may offer options for text messages or other electronic communications that may be received or accessed from your cellular phone
    and you agree that by enrolling in these services, you understand and agree to be responsible for any fees or charges you incur as a
    result of this enrollment.
20. Foreign Currency Conversion: If you make a transaction with your Account in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, Visa or MasterCard
    will convert the charge in a U.S. dollar amount using either (a) a rate selected by Visa or MasterCard from the range of rates available
    in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa or MasterCard
    receives, or (b) the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used by Visa
    and MasterCard for a particular transaction is the rate Visa and MasterCard selects on the processing date and may differ from the
    rate on the date the transaction occurred or the rate on the date the transaction is posted to your Account.

    Fair Credit Billing Act.

(i) ACCOUNT 

This is the Agreement that covers your Banco Popular North America MasterCard credit card account 
(called your �Account�) with us. In this Agreement, and in your Account Statements (each, an 
�Account Statement�), the words �you� and �your� refer to all persons named on the credit card 
application, credit card, or acceptance form, as well as their heirs and executors, and the words �we�, 
�us� and �our� and �Bank� refer to Banco Popular North America. 


 

You can use your credit card (�Card�) to purchase goods and services at participating merchants and 
to take Cash Advances as described in this Agreement. You agree not to use your Card for any 
unlawful purpose. If you use, or allow someone else to use, any Card associated with your Account 
for any other purpose, you will be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us and 
MasterCard� International Incorporated (�MasterCard�) for all amounts or expenses either Banco 
Popular North America or MasterCard pays as a result of such use. 

 

(ii) PROMISE TO PAY 

You promise to pay for (a) credit extended by Banco Popular North America, to you or to anyone 
whom you permit to use any Card associated with your Account; (b) INTEREST CHARGES, late 
charges, and any other fees or administrative charges (e.g., returned check charges) provided in this 
Agreement; and (c) collection costs and attorneys' fees as permitted by applicable law if your Account 
should go into default. 

 

(iii) CASH ADVANCES 

The term �Cash Advance� includes the following transactions: (1) Automated Teller Machine (ATM) 
transactions; (2) convenience check transactions; (3) money orders, cashiers checks, travelers 
checks, wire transfers, foreign currency or other in-bank transactions; (4) tax payments; (5) certain 
permitted gambling transactions; and (6) court costs, bail bonds and fines. Convenience checks are 
used the same as personal checks and are drawn from your Account and billed on your monthly 
Account Statement. 

 

(iv) CREDIT LIMIT 

You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases 
and Cash Advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon 
receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each Account 
Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit 
limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you 
exceed your authorized credit limit, the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return 
or forfeit the Card and close the Account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, 
shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized 
credit limit. 

 

(v) INTEREST CHARGES 

Monthly INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on all balances on this Account. The INTEREST 
CHARGE applied to purchases and balance transfers from other institutions will be based on variable 
Annual Percentage Rates (�APR�). This APR can increase or decrease for each billing period. Different 
APRs can apply to purchases, Cash Advances, balance transfers from other institutions, and 
convenience checks. Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for specific APRs related to your 
Account. 

Variable APRs will be determined by adding the United States Prime Rate as published in The Wall 
Street Journal (�Prime Rate�) to a margin. There is no pre-set limit on rate increases. The amount of 
your margins and current APRs are disclosed in the accompanying card mailer. We determine the 
margins applicable to your Account based on your credit history at the time of approval of your Card 
application. An increase in the Prime Rate will cause an increase in your APR, the INTEREST CHARGE 
and your minimum payment. 

The �Daily Periodic Rate� is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances and is determined 
by dividing the APR by 365 and rounding up. For each billing period, the APR will be based on the 
Prime Rate published two business days prior to the Account Statement/closing date for that billing 
period. In the event the Prime Rate is not available as of that date, we may substitute a similar 
published rate that is outside of our control. To the extent permitted by law, any change in your APR 
will apply to the existing balance on your Account and to new transactions. 

The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances. The INTEREST 
CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the 
number of days in the billing period. 

The Average Daily Balance for purchases is obtained by taking into account the initial daily balance on 
purchases, plus any new purchases, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on purchases, and any 
other fees and charges that we add that day, minus any payments and credits we apply to the 
purchase balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the 
total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. New purchases are added to the daily 
balance on posting date, unless we elect to use a later date. Purchases will begin to accrue INTEREST 
CHARGES on the date of posting. No INTEREST CHARGE will be imposed on a purchase added to your 
daily balance during the billing cycle covered by the Account Statement if that Account Statement 
shows no previous balance or shows that the previous balance was paid in full by its payment due 
date. Also, no additional INTEREST CHARGE will be charged on any purchases included in the new 
balance of a monthly Account Statement if you pay the new balance in full on or before the date 
specified in your Account Statement. The payment due date will be 25 days or more, depending upon 
the payment due date on your Account. 

The Average Daily Balance for Cash Advances is obtained by taking into account the initial daily 
balance on Cash Advances, plus any new Cash Advances, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on 
Cash Advances, and any other Cash Advance fees that we add that day, minus any payments and 
credits we apply to the Cash Advance balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing 
period are added and the total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. The INTEREST 


CHARGE on Cash Advances, balance transfers and convenience checks will be imposed from the date 
the transaction is conducted. There is no �free ride� period for such transactions. 

Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for other terms which are made a part of this 
Agreement. 

 

(vi) ANNUAL FEE 

If applicable, the annual fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is 
issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the first Card. Please refer to the 
accompanying card mailer for specific annual fee information related to your Account. 

 

(vii) MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 

We will not impose any late charges or penalty fees if you pay at least the minimum payment 
reflected on your Account Statement by the specified �Payment Due� date. If you wish, you may pay 
more than the minimum payment and at any time you may pay the entire amount due for the current 
billing cycle. Send payments to Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 
2938, Milwaukee, WI 53201-2938. 

 

Your payment will be credited as of the day we receive it, subject to any applicable cutoff hour. The 
new cutoff time for payments received by mail, telephone and other electronic means is 5:00 p.m. 
Central Time. We offer the convenience of online payments. Please visit www.mypopularcards.com to 
set up an account and avail of this free online payment service. Payments received by 5:00 pm CST, 
Monday through Friday, will be processed the same day. Online payments received on Saturday, 
Sunday or a Bank holiday will be processed the next business day. If the payment is made at a Bank 
branch during business hours in cash or with a check drawn against the Bank, it will be processed the 
same day. Credit for any other payments may be delayed five (5) business days during which interest 
will not accrue. If your payment due date falls on a weekend or legal federal holiday, the payment 
received will be credited to the account on the next business day and will not be considered late. If your 
payment is received after the payment cutoff time on the due date or any time thereafter, a late 
payment fee will be charged to your Account. Please refer to the back of your card mailer for more 
details regarding the minimum monthly payment and other important terms applicable to your Account. 

 

(viii) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS 

If you pay the required minimum payment of the monthly Account Statement, the payment shall be 
applied in the following way: first to INTEREST CHARGES and the rest shall be applied first to the 
debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances, with the lowest APR and then to the debt with the 
higher APR in ascending order. Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until 
the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required 
payment, the excess shall be applied first to the debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances 
with the highest APR and then to the debt with the lowest APR in descending order. 

 

All payments by mail must be made by check or money order. Payments may not be made by 
attempting to effect a transfer or by using a convenience check from this Account or from any other 
Banco Popular North America credit card account. You agree that any payment you make may be, 
but is not required to be, returned to you without applying it to your Account and without 
presentment or protest, for reasons including, but not limited to, that the check or money order: (1) 
is missing a signature; (2) is drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (3) contains a 
restrictive endorsement; (4) is post dated; (5) is not payable to Banco Popular North America; (6) is 
not payable in U.S. dollars; (7) is not paid upon presentment; or (8) results from an attempted 
transfer or is drawn on a convenience check. You agree to pay any Bank collection fees we incur for 
any check payments made in U.S. dollars drawn on a financial institution not located in the United 
States. All payments made by mail under this Agreement must be received at the address specified 
on your Account Statement. 

 

Any conditional check, money order or any other instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a 
disputed debt or as an accord and satisfaction or containing a restrictive endorsement must be sent 
to us at the Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 2938, Milwaukee, 
WI 53201-2938. You must note conspicuously on the face of the payment that it is tendered for this 
purpose. If you make a payment in any other manner and we accept it, we will not have waived our 
rights to collect any amounts owed under this Agreement. Even though your payment may be posted 
to your Account, we may not restore your available credit or Cash Advance available credit 
immediately. 

 

(ix) MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENT 

The Bank shall mail to you a monthly Account Statement at the end of each billing period in which 
you have a balance in excess of $1. You must notify the Bank, in writing, of any error in the Account 
Statement, within sixty (60) days, following the date on which the Account Statement was mailed. 

 

(x) FEES 

Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

a. Penalty fee: A late fee will be added to the standard purchase balance for each billing period you 
fail to pay by its due date the minimum payment due. Returned payment fees may also be charged. 

 

b. Currency conversion fee: If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, other than a cash 
advance made at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, MasterCard will convert the charge into a U.S. 
dollar amount. MasterCard currently uses a conversion rate in effect one day prior to its transaction 
processing date. Such rate is either a wholesale market rate or the government-mandated rate. 
Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

 


If you make a Cash Advance in a foreign currency at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, the 
amount is converted into U.S. dollars by our affiliate in accordance with its foreign currency 
conversion procedures then in effect. Our affiliate currently uses a conversion rate in effect on its 
applicable processing date. Such rate is either a mid-point market rate or the government-mandated 
rate. 

 

The foreign currency conversion rate in effect on the applicable processing date for a transaction may 
differ from the rate in effect on the sale or post date on your Account Statement for that transaction. 

 

If a transaction is converted by a third party prior to such transaction being processed by MasterCard, 
the foreign currency conversion rate for that transaction will be the rate selected by that third party. 

 

c. Administrative charges: We may charge you a fee to take advantage of certain optional 
administrative services we provide our Cardmembers such as copy of Account Statements, additional 
credit cards or express delivery services. Each time an administrative service is offered to you, any 
fee for the service will be reflected on your Account Statement. You agree to pay the fee disclosed 
each time you opt to take advantage of an administrative service. These services are optional and are 
not required to be used by you.

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS: Keep this Document for Future Use 

 

This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing 
Act. 

 

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Account Statement 

If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, write to us at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

In your letter, give us the following information: 

� Account information: Your name and account number. 
� Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
� Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, describe what 
you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. 


 

You must contact us: 

� Within 60 days after the error appeared on your Account Statement. 
� At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment 
on the amount you think is wrong. 


 

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not 
required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 

 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 

When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 

1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also 
tell you if we have already corrected the error. 

2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we 
believe the Account Statement is correct. 

 

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 

� We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
� The charge in question may remain on your Account Statement, and we may continue to impose 
INTEREST CHARGES on that amount. 
� While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your 
balance. 
� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 


 

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 

� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any INTEREST CHARGES 
or other fees related to that amount. 



� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with 
applicable INTEREST CHARGES and fees. We will send you an Account Statement of the amount 
you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the 
amount we think you owe. 


 

If you receive our explanation but still believe your Account Statement is wrong, you must write to us 
within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent 
without also reporting that you are questioning your Account Statement. We must tell you the name 
of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when 
the matter has been settled between us. 

 

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you 
question even if your Account Statement is correct. 

 

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Card Purchases 

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your Card and you 
have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay 
the remaining amount due on the purchase. 

 

To use this right, all of the following must be true: 

1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing 
address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. 

(Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to 
you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 

2. You must have used your Card for the purchase. Purchases made with Cash Advances from an ATM 
or with a check that accesses your Account do not qualify. 

3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 

 

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in 
writing at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we 
finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount 
and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

••• IMPORTANT NOTICE •••
NEIMAN MARCUS/BERGDORF GOODMAN CARDHOLDER

If you refuse to accept this Account, you will be required to return the merchandise or to make other payment arrangements with Neiman Marcus/Bergdorf Goodman for any purchases to date which could have been applied to your Account.
How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called ""average daily balance (including new purchases)""  See your Cardholder Agreement for more details.
Billing Rights: Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided in your Cardholder Agreement.
You may pay the entire New Balance on your Account at any time.
Cardholder Agreement
 and Disclosure Statement
1. GENERAL: Each person whose name appears on the Account has a credit card Account with HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., a national banking association, and requests one or more credit card(s) bearing the name or tradename of Neiman Marcus or Bergdorf Goodman to be used in connection with the Account. The word ""Card"" means any credit card(s) issued to you or an authorized user of your Account. In this Agreement, the words ""you"" and ""your"" refer to the person or persons whose name(s) appear on the Account and the words ""we"", ""us"" and ""our"" refer to HSBC Bank Nevada,N.A. You agree that you will only purchase goods and services for personal, family and household purposes from Neiman Marcus or Bergdorf Goodman.
2. PROMISE TO PAY: You agree to pay all amounts charged to the Account, whether incurred by you or anyone you authorize or permit to use your Account or Card. If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.
3. ABILITY TO REPAY: When you use the Account or permit others to use the Account, you represent that you have the ability and intention to repay all amounts charged to the Account.
4. BILLING STATEMENT: We will send you a billing statement monthly for each billing cycle at the end of which you have a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00, or in which a Interest Charge has been imposed. The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle. The billing statement will show the amount owed on your Account. The total Amount owed is called “New Balance” on your billing statement subject to the terms of Promotional Credit Plan purchases, if any, as indicated below.
5. PROMOTIONAL CREDIT PLANS: The following Promotional Credit Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase: 
Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan – no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase for a specified period, as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle. All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Credit Plan are referred to as Regular Credit Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Card. Call 1-888-367-4310 or review the Application of Payments section of this Agreement for information.
6. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any late fees, returned payment fees and other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If the Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(e) The Daily Periodic Rate which is used to determine your Interest Charges and the corresponding Annual Percentage Rate, will be variable rates which may change monthly. The Daily Periodic Rate will be one-three hundred sixty fifth of the sum of the U.S. prime rate published in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal that is in effect on the last day of the month (“Prime Rate”) plus a “Spread” of 20.74 percentage points for the Standard Rate. Any changes in the Prime Rate will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle beginning in the next month. 
For example, as of the billing cycle beginning September 1, 2011, the Interest Charge for the Standard Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .06573% (corresponding 23.99% Annual Percentage Rate). An increase in the Prime Rate will increase your applicable Daily Periodic Rate which may increase the Interest Charge and the Minimum Payment due on your Account.
7. MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE: A minimum Interest Charge of $.50 will be assessed for each billing cycle in which an Interest Charge is payable.
8. FEES: We may impose on your Account the following fees, which will be added to your Account when assessed:
a)	Late Payment Fee: A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account within 6 days after the Payment Due Date.
	The amount of the Late Payment Fee is shown in the chart below. In no event will your Late Payment Fee exceed the amount of your Minimum Payment Due. 

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - Up to and including $100
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $19
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $19

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $100 and up to and including $300
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $29

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $300
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $35
b)	Returned Payment Fee: A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
	Your Returned Payment Fee is $25.
	In no event will your Returned Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
c)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
9. MINIMUM PAYMENT: You agree to pay us at least the  Minimum Payment Due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due. The Minimum Payment, is the greater of $25 or 5% of the ""New Balance"" of each Promotional Credit Plan which requires a Minimum Payment and all Regular Credit Plans, as shown on your billing statement, plus any late payment fees rounded up to the nearest $5. All Minimum Payments are then combined into the Minimum Payment. Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments, which may affect crediting of your payments.
10. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) missing a signature; (b) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (c) restrictively endorsed; (d) postdated; (e) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (f) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A.-Neiman Marcus/Bergdorf Goodman, P.O. Box 720937, Dallas, TX 75372-0937. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
11. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances.
12. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by Neiman Marcus or Bergdorf Goodman to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of Neiman Marcus or Bergdorf Goodman to accept or honor the Card.
13. SECURITY: Except as indicated below, you grant us a purchase money security interest in the goods purchased with your Card and in all insurance contracts and all proceeds, returned premiums,mechanical failure and extended service contracts, and refunds of charges for mechanical failure and extended service contracts financed therewith. Each good purchased on your Account will secure the entire Account balance until such good is paid in full. For purposes of determining which goods are subject to a security interest, payments received will be deemed to be applied first to any unpaid insurance premiums (if applicable), Interest Charges and fees and then to pay for purchases on the Account in the order in which they were made. When sufficient payments are made to repay the portion of the Account balance attributable to the purchase of a particular good, we will release our purchase money security interest in that good. Goods covered by a security interest may be taken from you if you do not pay on time. We may require you to make them available at a convenient place of our choice. We take no security interest in goods where the original purchase price is less than $200 if you live in New York and in goods where the original purchase price is less than $700 if you live in Maryland. If we repossess any goods purchased with your Card, we may charge you our repossession cost including, but not limited to, necessary repairs, storage fees and costs of sale, when and as permitted by law.
14. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your payment check being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (l) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (m) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.

Federal Arbitration Act

The arbitrator's award shall not be subject to appeal except as permitted by the FAA. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Claims and Arbitration Administrators
This arbitration provision shall apply to any Claim (defined below) by or against us, or you or any other Covered Person (defined below). You agree any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether based upon contract; tort, intentional or otherwise; constitution; statute; common law; or equity and whether preexisting, present or future), including initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third party claims, arising from or relating to (a) this Agreement, the application, your Account, any transaction or activity involving any payment or failure to make payment on your Account, or any solicitation, advertisement, promotion, or oral or written statements related to this Agreement or your Account, (b) the relationships which result from this Agreement and your relationship with any Covered Person pursuant to the criteria in the immediately preceding subsection or (c) the scope, validity or enforceability of this arbitration clause, any part thereof or the entire Agreement (any of the forgoing a ""Claim""), shall be resolved, upon the election of you, us, or any other Covered Person described below, by binding arbitration pursuant to this arbitration provision and the applicable rules or procedures of the arbitration administrator (the “Administrator”) selected at the time the Claim is filed or received by a party to the Claim. The party initiating the arbitration proceeding shall have the right to select one of the following Administrators: Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) or the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). The arbitrator shall be a lawyer with more than ten years experience or a retired or former judge.

Our address for service of process under this provision is HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., P.O. Box 98740, Las Vegas, NV 89193-8740.
Small Claims Exemption
We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim you may bring in small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration at such time.
Location of Arbitration and Fees
Any participatory arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient to you.  On any Claim you file, you will pay the first $50 of the filing fee. At your request we will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the Administrator on any Claim submitted by you in arbitration up to a maximum of $1,500. If you are required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, we will consider a request by you to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, we shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees unless the arbitrator grants you an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in your favor, we will reimburse you for any additional fees paid or owed by you to the Administrator up  to the amount of the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual award in your favor. The parties shall bear the expense of their respective attorney's fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, or the fees paid to the Administrator, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein.

If a Claim that is within the scope of the first paragraph of the “Claims and Arbitration Administrators” paragraph above is advanced by or against any third person, and any of the persons mentioned in the previous sentence is involved as a party, then the entire Claim is subject to arbitration under this Agreement, including any Claim by or against any third person.
Protection of Information
The rules and procedures of the Administrator, which you may obtain from that organization, shall govern the arbitration unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will control. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, nor to state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. If you or we request, the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized under applicable law and will use best efforts to protect confidential information (including through use of protective orders).
Parties to Arbitration
Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.”
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver.  You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules. In the event of such an appeal, an appeal panel consisting of three arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The panel's decision will be final and binding. Any final decision of the arbitrator or of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as provided under the FAA. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the FAA by any court having jurisdiction.
Consequences of Electing Arbitration
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY EITHER PARTY.

CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
1. GENERAL: Each person signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application for a credit card account (“Account”) as applicant or joint applicant applies for an Account with HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., a national banking association, and requests one or more credit card(s) bearing the name or tradename of Helzberg Diamonds to be used in connection with the Account. The word “Card” means any credit card(s) issued to you or an authorized user of your Account. In this Agreement, the words “you” and “your” refer to the applicant and joint applicant named on the credit card application and the words “we”, “us” and “our” refer to HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., located at 1111 Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144.
If your application is approved, “applicant” will be referred to as “primary cardholder” and “joint applicant” will be referred to as “secondary cardholder” for purposes of this agreement.
If we accept your application to open an Account, you agree that you will only purchase goods and services for personal, family and household purposes from merchants which honor the Card.
2. ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT: By a) signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application, using or permitting others to use the Card, b) signing or permitting others to sign sales slips; or c) making or permitting others to make purchases by telephone, Internet, or any other means, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Cardholder Agreement and Disclosure Statement, which includes an arbitration provision.
3. PROMISE TO PAY: You agree to pay all amounts charged to the Account, whether incurred by you or anyone you authorize or permit to use your Account or Card. If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.
4. ABILITY TO REPAY: When you use the Account or permit others to use the Account, you represent that you have the ability and intention to repay all amounts charged to the Account.
5. BILLING STATEMENT: We will send you a billing statement monthly for each billing cycle at the end of which you have a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00, or in which an Interest Charge has been imposed. The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other charges or fees, including credit insurance or debt cancellation (if applicable), and all payments and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle. The billing statement will show the amount owed on your Account. The total Amount owed is called “New Balance” on your billing statement subject to the terms of Promotional Credit Plan purchases, if any, as indicated below.
6. PROMOTIONAL CREDIT PLANS: The following Promotional Credit Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase: a) Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan – no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase for a specified period, as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; b) Same As Cash/Monthly Payment Credit Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase before the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, Interest Charges will be imposed from the purchase date; c) Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; d) Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan – A special repayment factor will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; e) Special Repayment Factor/Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A special repayment factor and a reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle.  All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Credit Plan are referred to as Regular Credit Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Card. Call 1-888-367-4310 or review the Application of Payments section of this Agreement for information.
7. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(iv) a purchase on a Same As Cash Credit Plan if the full cash sales price is paid in full before the promotion expiration date.
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan other than a Same As Cash Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Same As Cash Credit Plan during a cycle, the amount will be the sum of the following daily Interest Charge calculations for the Credit Plan during the current cycle and during each of the prior billing cycles (each a “Prior Cycle”) from the transaction date of the purchase through the current cycle: (i) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for the Current Cycle times the Daily Balance for each day in the current cycle; and (ii) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for each Prior Cycle times the Daily Balances of the Credit Plan for each day during each Prior Cycle.
(e) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) incurred on that day and 4) any late fees, over the credit limit fees, returned payment fees or other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. For any Same As Cash Credit Plan, credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) are not included in the Daily Balance of that Credit Plan during the promotional period. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(f) The Daily Periodic Rate for the Standard Rate will be .07096% (corresponding 25.9% Annual Percentage Rate). The Daily Periodic Rate for the Penalty Rate will be .07918% (corresponding 28.9% Annual Percentage Rate). Your APR may increase to the Penalty APR if we fail to receive your minimum payment with in 60 days when due. You will no longer be eligible for the Standard Rate and all existing Promotional Credit Plans will terminate, and your entire Account balance will be subject to the Penalty Rate. If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the new Penalty APR goes into effect.  If you make the next six consecutive on time minimum payments starting with your first payment due once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APR(s) applicable to your Account.  If you do not make these six consecutive on time minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.
8. MINIMUM Interest CHARGE: A minimum Interest Charge of $2.00 will be assessed for each billing cycle in which an Interest Charge is payable.
9. FEES: We may impose on your Account the following fees, which will be added to your Account when assessed:
a)	Late Payment Fee: A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
	Your Late Payment Fee is $25 for the first occurrence and $35 for additional occurrences during the next six billing cycles. In no event will your Late Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
b)	Returned Payment Fee: A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
	Your Returned Payment Fee is $25.
	In no event will your Returned Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
c)	Research Fees: A Research Fee may be assessed to the Account for each copy of a requested document. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such copies are requested.
d)	Reissued Card Fee: You may be charged $5 each time you request that your credit card be reissued.
e)	Payment by Phone Fee: A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment is requested.
f)	Over the Credit Limit Fee: In the event you exceed your credit limit, you will be charged an Over the Credit Limit Fee of $0.
g)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
10. INSURANCE: If available and you elect any credit insurance coverage, you authorize us to charge the insurance premium for such insurance to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the insurance premium is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the premium is being assessed. Credit insurance charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
11. DEBT CANCELLATION: If available and you elect debt cancellation, you authorize us to charge the fee for such debt cancellation to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the debt cancellation fee is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the fee is being assessed. Debt cancellation charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
12. MINIMUM PAYMENT: You agree to pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due. To obtain your Minimum Payment Due, we add the following amounts (1+2+3):
1) Any delinquent amount you owe us from a previous cycle;
2) the greater of
a.) 4% of your “Minimum Payment Balance” (which is your “New Balance” less balances on Special Repayment Factor Credit Plans)
or
b.) 1% of your Minimum Payment Balance; plus current billed Interest Charges and current Late Fees, plus the Special Repayment Factors for any Promotional Credit Plans with Special Repayment Factors, rounded to the next highest dollar.
If this amount is less than $40, we will use $40.
3) any debt cancellation fees or credit insurance premiums attributable to Promotional Credit Plans with Reduced Rate/Special Repayment Factors.
Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments, which may affect crediting of your payments.
13. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) not drawn in U.S. dollars on funds on deposit in the U.S.; (b) missing a signature; (c) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (d) restrictively endorsed; (e) postdated; (f) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (g) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to HSBC Retail Services, P.O. Box 5226, Carol Stream, IL 60197-5226. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
14. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances. If you have a Same As Cash Credit Plan(s), we will automatically apply payments received during the final two complete billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first to the required Minimum Payment Due and next to the plan(s) that is expiring, in the order of expiration; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0% APR for purposes of determining payment application.
15. CREDIT LIMIT: You agree not to let the Account balance exceed the credit limit established for you by us from time to time. We do not have to honor any use of your Card or honor credit card checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit, but if we do, you agree to repay the amount by which your credit limit is exceeded, plus Interest Charges immediately.
16. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of any merchant to accept or honor the Card or a credit card check.
17. SECURITY: Except as indicated below, you grant us a purchase money security interest in the goods purchased with your Card and in all insurance contracts and all proceeds, returned premiums, mechanical failure and extended service contracts, and refunds of charges for mechanical failure and extended service contracts financed therewith. Each good purchased on your Account will secure the entire Account balance until such good is paid in full. For purposes of determining which goods are subject to a security interest, payments received will be deemed to be applied first to any unpaid insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable), Interest Charges and fees and then to pay for purchases on the Account in the order in which they were made. When sufficient payments are made to repay the portion of the Account balance attributable to the purchase of a particular good, we will release our purchase money security interest in that good. Goods covered by a security interest may be taken from you if you do not pay on time. We may require you to make them available at a convenient place of our choice. We take no security interest in goods where the original purchase price is less than $200 if you live in New York and in goods where the original purchase price is less than $700 if you live in Maryland. If we repossess any goods purchased with your Card, we may charge you our repossession cost including, but not limited to, necessary repairs, storage fees and costs of sale, when and as permitted by law.
18. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Total Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your moving out of the U.S. or Canada or providing us with a non-U.S. or non-Canadian mailing address; (l) your becoming incompetent; (m) your exceeding your credit limit; (n) your payment being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (o) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (p) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.

The party initiating the arbitration proceeding shall have the right to select one of the following Administrators: Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services, Inc.

Our address for service of process under this provision is HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., P.O. Box 98740, Las Vegas, NV 89193-8740.
Small Claims Exemption
We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim you may bring in small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration at such time.
Location of Arbitration and Fees
Any participatory arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient to you. On any Claim you file, you will pay the first $50 of the filing fee.

The parties shall bear the expense of their respective attorney's fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, or the fees paid to the Administrator, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein.

Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.” The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver. You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules. In the event of such an appeal, an appeal panel consisting of three arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The panel's decision will be final and binding. Any final decision of the arbitrator or of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as provided under the FAA. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the FAA by any court having jurisdiction.
Consequences of Electing Arbitration
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY EITHER PARTY.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called �daily balance�. 

During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying 
the periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following 
balance types, as applicable: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or 
special promotions. 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees 
posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type.

GE MONEY BANK 
CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT 


1. CONTRACT. This Agreement (�Agreement�) is a contract for the extension of credit. It controls your credit card account referenced on the document received with your credit card or 
on your welcome letter. This Agreement includes this document and the following documents: 
� The application or any other document you submitted to us in connection with the account; and 
� The privacy policy that is enclosed with or attached to this document. 
By opening or using your account, you agree to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement starts when (i) you give us an account application we approve or (ii) you use your account or 
let someone else use it, whichever occurs first. 

2. PARTIES. The parties to this Agreement are you and GE Money Bank. GE Money Bank is located at 170 West Election Road, Suite 125, Draper, Utah 84020. GE Money Bank 
sometimes is called �us,� �we� or �our� in this Agreement. 

3. PROMISE TO PAY. You promise to pay us for all credit that we extend on your account, including credit extended when you let another person use your account. You also promise to 
pay us for all other amounts owed to us under this Agreement. 

4. CHANGING TERMS. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may change, add to or delete any of the terms of this Agreement, including the interest rates, 
fees and charges. 

5. GOVERNING LAW. Except as provided in the Dispute and Claim Resolution (Including Arbitration) provision, this Agreement and your account are governed by federal 
law and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of Utah without regard to its conflicts of law principles. This Agreement has been accepted by us in Utah. 

6. CREDIT CARD. We have issued or will send you a credit card for your use. You are not permitted to allow anyone else to use your credit card, but if you do, you will be responsible 
for such use. You will destroy all the credit card(s) issued on your account if we ask you to do so. 

7. AUTHORIZED USER/JOINT ACCOUNT. If you ask us to send a credit card to another person that you want to let use your account, you will be responsible for all transactions made 
by that person. That person will be considered an authorized user. If another person is approved on the account, that person will be considered a joint accountholder. Each joint 
accountholder may use the account and agrees to the terms of this Agreement. No matter which joint accountholder uses the account, each of you must pay back the full amount owed 
on the account. We may treat each of you as one accountholder. For example, giving notice to one of you is considered the same as giving notice to both of you. Also, we may follow the 
instructions that we get from one of you even if they differ from instructions given by the other accountholder. 

8. USING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may use your account only as stated in this Agreement. You may use your account for the following: 
� Purchases. You may buy goods or services; 
� Cash Advances. If applicable, you may get cash advances by writing convenience checks we may provide to you from time to time or by other means we may make available. We 
may not honor a convenience check (i) if you filed for bankruptcy, (ii) if the check is expired, (iii) if your account is closed, (iv) if the amount of the check would exceed your available 
credit or cash advance limit, or (v) as otherwise stated on your convenience check; and 
� Balance Transfers. If applicable, from time to time, we may offer you the chance to transfer balances from your other credit card accounts to this account. Unless we tell you 
otherwise, we will treat balance transfers as purchases. We reserve the right to decline to process any balance transfer request for any reason, and will not transfer a balance from 
any of our affiliates. Transfers will be processed in the order determined by us. If the amount you wish to transfer is greater than your available credit limit, we may reject the 
request(s). It may take up to four weeks for a balance transfer request to be credited to your other credit card account(s). It is your responsibility to make any payments required to 
keep your other account(s) current and to close your other account(s), if you desire. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur on your other account(s) as a result of 
your balance transfer(s). If you have a dispute with a creditor, and pay the balance in question by transferring it to your account, you may lose certain dispute rights. 
You may use your account only for lawful personal, family or household purposes. You may not use your account for internet gambling or illegal purposes. You may not use your account 
to pay amounts you owe us on this account or on other accounts you have with us. These restrictions are for our benefit, and we are not responsible to you for enforcing them. 

9. CREDIT AND CASH ADVANCE LIMITS. 
A. Assigning Limits. We will assign the following limit(s) on your account, as applicable. We may increase or decrease either or both of these limits at any time. 
Credit Limit � This is the highest amount of total credit we will extend to you on your account. 

Cash Advance Limit � This is the highest amount of credit we will extend to you for cash advances made on your account, if applicable. Cash transactions will also count 
towards your credit limit. 

B. Exceeding Limits. We may refuse to authorize you to use your account if that use (including any fees associated with that use) will cause the total you will owe on your account to 
be more than your credit limit. If applicable, you may not get a cash advance if that cash advance (including interest and cash advance fees) will cause the total you will owe for 
cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit. If we approve a transaction that causes the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit 
limit or, if applicable, the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit, we do not give up any of our rights under this Agreement 
and we do not treat it as an increase in your credit limit or, if applicable, cash advance limit. 

C. Limiting Transactions. We reserve the right to not approve transactions on your account. To prevent fraud, we may also limit the number or dollar amount of transactions you can 
make in a particular amount of time. 

10. INTEREST. This section explains (i) the interest rates that will apply to your account, (ii) when interest will be charged on your account, and (iii) how the amount of interest is calculated. 

A. Rates. The following rates apply to purchases and, if applicable, cash advances. A higher rate, which we call a �Penalty APR� may apply at certain times as described below. The 
Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account are shown in the table above and will also be shown on your billing statement. 
We calculate interest on the balance of your account each day. We use a daily rate to calculate the interest each day. The daily rate is equal to the APR divided by 365. 

1. Purchase Rate. The daily rate for purchases is .06572% (APR 23.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
2. Cash Advance Rate. The daily rate for cash advances is .08216% (APR 29.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
3. Penalty Rate. The penalty rate may apply if you do not make your total minimum payment by the payment due date and will continue to apply as provided in this section. As 
required by law, we will provide you with advance notice if we are going to apply the penalty rate to your account and we will tell you when the penalty rate will apply. 
a. What is the Penalty Rate? The daily penalty rate will be .08216% (APR 29.99%). 
b. How Long Will the Penalty Rate Apply? If you are not more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to transactions made on your account after a date 
specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make all required payments by the payment due date for six consecutive billing periods, your rate will return to the 
standard APR; otherwise, the penalty rate will apply indefinitely. 
If you are or become more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to all balances and new transactions on your account not already subject to the penalty 
rate as specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make six consecutive minimum payments by the payment due date, starting with your first payment due 
date after the date specified in the advance notice, your rate for any balances created on your account prior to or within 14 days after the date of the advance notice 

that are not already subject to (or scheduled under a prior notice to be subject to) the penalty rate will return to the standard APR. If you do not make these six consecutive 
minimum payments, we may apply the penalty rate to all balances on your account indefinitely. 

B. When We Charge Interest. 
1. Purchases. We charge interest on your purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full, except as set forth below: 
�We will not charge you interest during a billing cycle on any purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the billing cycle or (ii) you had such a balance, you paid 
that balance in full by the due date in that billing cycle. 
� We will credit, as of the beginning of the billing cycle, any payment you make by the due date that we allocate to purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the 
previous billing cycle, or (ii) if you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in the previous billing cycle. 
2. Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. If applicable, we charge interest on your balance transfers and cash advances (and their related fees) from the date you make the 
transaction until you pay them in full. You cannot avoid paying interest on balance transfers or cash advances or on their fees. 

C. How We Calculate Interest. During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the 
periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types, as applicable: 
purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 
� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract 
any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. We charge a minimum of $2 of 
interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest. 

11. FEES. We may charge some or all of the following fees. The table at the beginning of this Agreement shows the amount of each of the maintenance, transaction and penalty fees. 
A. A monthly Maintenance Fee each month your account is open and has a balance greater than zero. 

B. Transaction Fees. 
1. A Balance Transfer Fee for each balance transfer you make. 
2. A Cash Advance Fee for each cash advance you get. 
3. A Promotional Fee related to certain special promotions. For fixed payment promotions, the promotional fee will not be added to the purchase balance for calculation of 
the total minimum payment due; the fee must be paid as part of the promotional balance. The fee will be included in the purchase balance for all other promotions and must 
be paid as part of promotional balance. 

C. Penalty Fees. 
1. A Late Payment Fee if we do not receive at least the total minimum payment due on your account by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the due date shown on your statement. The amount 
of the late payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if you have paid at least your total minimum payment due by the payment due date in each of the prior six billing cycles or 
(2) $35 if you have failed to pay at least the total minimum payment due by the payment due date in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the late 
payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for which the late payment fee is assessed, the amount of the late payment fee will instead be equal to the 
amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 
2. A Returned Payment Fee if any check or other instrument sent to us, or any electronic payment authorization you provide us in payment on your account, is not honored 
upon first presentment, even if the check, instrument or electronic authorization is later honored. The amount of the returned payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if 
your payments have been honored upon first presentment in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any payment has been dishonored upon first presentment in any 
one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the returned payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for the cycle in which the payment was dishonored 
upon first presentment, the amount of the returned payment fee will instead be equal to the amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

D. Other Fees. 
1. A Returned Convenience Check Fee of up to $35 if we do not honor a convenience check because (i) it will cause you to go over your cash advance limit, (ii) you filed a 
petition in bankruptcy, (iii) the check is expired, or (iv) your account is closed. The amount of the returned convenience check fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if your convenience 
checks have been honored in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any convenience check has been dishonored in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. 
However, if the returned convenience check fee would exceed the amount of the dishonored convenience check, the amount of the returned convenience check fee will 
instead be equal to the amount of the dishonored convenience check. 

2. A Stop Payment Fee of $39.99 if we stop payment on any convenience check at your request. 

12. YOUR PAYMENTS. 
A. Required Payment and Crediting of Payment. Each billing cycle you must pay at least the total minimum payment by 5:00 pm (ET) on the payment due 
date. You may at any time pay more than the total minimum payment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payment may reduce the 
amount of interest you will pay. Any payments received after 5:00 pm (ET) will be credited as of the next day. We may delay making credit available 
on your account in the amount of your payment. 

B. Minimum Payment. Your total minimum payment is the greatest of (a) $35, (b) 2.5% of your highest New Balance for the life of your account, or (c) 
the interest and late payment fees billed on your statement plus $20. As used in this paragraph, �new balance� excludes any balance attributable to 
any special promotion that involves delayed or special payments. We round up to the next highest whole dollar in figuring your total minimum 
payment. If your new balance on your billing statement is less than $35, then your total minimum payment will be equal to the new balance. 

C. How to Make a Payment. 
To make a payment you must follow all the instructions below and the instructions on your billing statement. If you do not follow these instructions, credit 
of your payment to your account may be delayed up to five days. 
1. Do the following: (a) make your payment in United States dollars by check, money order, or similar instrument from a bank located in the U.S; (b) send the payment coupon 
from your billing statement with your payment; (c) send the payment and payment coupon in the envelope provided with your billing statement to the payment address listed on 
your billing statement; and (d) send only one payment and one payment coupon in each envelope. Alternatively you may make your payment online at the website address 
shown on your billing statement provided you make your payment in United States dollars from a bank located in the U.S. 
2. Do not do the following: (a) staple, paper clip, tape or fold your payment or payment coupon; (b) include any other papers or items with your payment; (c) use a balance 
transfer or convenience check from your account to pay us; or (d) send us cash. 

D. Other Ways to Make a Payment. 
Certain participating stores or providers may take payments that you make to them as a convenience to you. We may not credit those payments 
to your account until we receive them. We may allow you to make payments over the phone as an accommodation to you, but we may charge you a fee to do so. 

E. Disputed Amounts. 
If you send us correspondence about a disputed amount, you must send it to the address for billing inquiries shown on your billing statement. 
You may not send it to the payment address shown on your billing statement. By �disputed amount,� we mean a payment of less than the full balance on your account 
that is labeled as �payment in full� or similar language, or is given to us as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, or is given to us with other conditions or limitations. 
We may accept these types of payments without giving up any of our rights. 

F. Authorization. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or 
to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon 
as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. 

G. Payment Allocation. We reserve the right to select the method by which the required minimum payment is allocated to different balances on your account. Some or all of the 
required minimum payment on your account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. The payment allocation method that we use may result in higher 
interest on your account or reduced savings attributable to any special promotions. Any payment you make in excess of the required minimum payment will be allocated to 
balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs, unless applicable law requires or permits otherwise (such as when your account has a certain type of special 
promotion). 

13. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS. At times, we may offer you special promotions when you use your account for certain transactions. These special promotions will have some terms that 
are different from the terms in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement apply to any special promotion, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the special promotion. We 
may terminate your participation in any special promotion and/or apply the penalty rate to your account balances (including special promotion balances) if you become more than 60 days 
late on any payment due on your account. If this happens, each special promotion balance will no longer be subject to the terms of the special promotion and will instead be subject to the 
terms of this Agreement. A promotional charge may be charged as part of a special promotion. Please see any special promotion advertising (including in-store signs) or other disclosures 
provided to you for the full terms of any special promotion offered. 

14. SECURITY INTEREST. You grant us a purchase money security interest in each item of merchandise purchased on your account to secure its unpaid purchase price until such 
merchandise is paid in full. Solely for the purpose of determining the extent of our purchase money security interest in each such item of merchandise, your payments will be allocated 
first to interest on the account, and then to pay off each purchase on the account in the order in which the purchase was made (if more than one item was purchased on the same day, 
your payments will be allocated to pay off the lowest priced item first). If you made a purchase pursuant to a credit promotion, the balance with respect to the promotional purchase may 
be shown on statements during the promotional period and may reflect a different payment allocation method. In no event will we assert a security interest in the promotional purchase for 
an amount greater than the lowest balance shown on a statement for that promotional purchase. We agree that no security interest is or will be retained or acquired under this agreement 
in any real property which is used or is expected to be used as your dwelling. Should we feel it necessary, you authorize us to sign and file financing statements regarding any vehicle 
purchased. 
For some individual purchases under your account, we may require you to maintain property/casualty insurance on the purchase as a condition of granting you credit. You will be 
informed of any property/casualty insurance requirement at the time you make the purchase. 

15. UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should call us immediately at 1-800-250-5411. 
You will not be liable for any unauthorized use on your account. 

You agree that unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given your card or allowed use of your account. You will be responsible for all use by such a 
person. 

16. YOUR CREDIT REPORTS AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION. 
A. Using and Sharing Your Information. When you applied for an account you gave us information about yourself. You also agreed that we could ask others for information about 
your creditworthiness and that we could ask consumer reporting agencies for your consumer report. We use this information in considering your application. We also use this 
information for any updates, renewals or extensions of credit on your account. We use this information to review and collect your account. We use this information to provide you 
with offers. We may give information about you or your account to consumer reporting agencies and other proper parties. This information may include your performance under this 
Agreement.

report that includes the wrong information, send a copy of it with your written communication. We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late 
payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. 

17. USE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOUR ACCOUNT. We will give information about you and your account to dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals 
that accept this credit card (and their affiliates) and you consent to this. Dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals will use the information in connection with the credit 
card program and for things like creating and updating their records and offering you special benefits. We will use information about you and your account as set forth in the privacy policy 
that is attached to or enclosed with this document. 

18. CHANGE OF ADDRESS/PHONE NUMBER. You agree to tell us right away if you change your address or phone number(s). We will contact you at the address in our records until 
we are able to update our records with your new address. 

19. CONSENT TO COMMUNICATIONS. You consent to us contacting you using all channels of communication and for all purposes (including collection purposes), using all contact 
information you provide to us. You also consent to us and any other owner or servicer of your account contacting you about your account, including using text messages, any automatic 
telephone dialing system and/or an artificial or prerecorded voice when contacting you, even if you are charged for the call under your phone plan. You are responsible for any charges for 
contacting you that may be billed to you by your communications carriers. 

20. TELEPHONE MONITORING. For quality control purposes, you permit us to listen to or record telephone calls between you and us. 

21. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. 
A. When You May Close Your Account. You may close your account at any time by writing or calling us and asking us to close your account. You must send this writing to the 
address shown on your billing statement or call us at the customer service number shown on your billing statement. We will close your account after we get your request. 
B. When We May Close Your Account. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may close your account at any time and for any reason. 
C. After You or We Close Your Account. If you or we close your account, you must stop using it. You will still have to pay us the full amount you owe on your account. This 
Agreement controls your account until you pay it in full. 

22. DEFAULT. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, you are in default if you: 
� Make a late payment; 
� Do not follow any other term of this Agreement; or 
� Become bankrupt or insolvent. 
If you default or upon your death, we may, subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law: (i) make the full amount owing on your account due right away; (ii) bring a legal 
action to collect all amounts owed; and/or (iii) take any action allowed by law. We may also reduce your credit limit or close your account at any time whether or not you are in default. 

23. COLLECTION COSTS. If we ask an attorney to collect your account, we may charge you our collection costs. Collection costs may include court costs, reasonable attorneys� fees 
and fees for repossession, repair, storage and sale of any vehicle securing a purchase. We will charge these costs only if the attorney we ask to collect is not our salaried employee and 
the law allows us to do so. 

24. DISPUTE AND CLAIM RESOLUTION (INCLUDING ARBITRATION) PROVISION. 
General /Requirement to Arbitrate. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION 
WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A 
COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS 
INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED. This Provision replaces any existing arbitration provision with us and will stay in force no matter 
what happens to your account, including termination. Upon demand, and except as otherwise provided below, you and we must arbitrate individually any dispute or claim between you, any joint cardholder and/or any additional cardholder, 
on the one hand; and us, our affiliates, agents and/or dealers/merchants/retailers or participating professionals, on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises from or relates to your 
account. However, we will not require you to arbitrate: (1) any individual case in small claims court or your state�s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court; or 
(2) any claim by us that only involves our effort to collect money you owe us. However, if you respond to a collection lawsuit by claiming that we engaged in any wrongdoing, we may 

require you to arbitrate.

VISA PLATINUM CONSUMER CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT 
In this Agreement, �Agreement� means this Consumer Credit Card Agreement. �Disclosure� means the Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement. 
1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will not allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that exceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled �Statements and Notices�) explaining your right to opt in to the Credit Union�s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in to such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. 
You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six 
(6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. 
2. 
USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery tickets, and casino gaming chips, as applicable. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal. 

3. 
PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or 



�CUNA MUTUAL GROUP, 1991, 2006, 09, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DTXD40 (MXC500)-e 
another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account. 
4. 
PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement. 

5. 
FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle. Finance charge begins to accrue on those purchases from the first day of the next billing cycle, unless you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle�s billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 


The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the purchase balance. (We do not add in any purchases posted during the billing cycle.) This gives us the daily balance of purchases. Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as purchases. 
For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To get the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. Then, we add all the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. 
6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. 
A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or 
U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
7. FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
a. 
Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency. 

b. 
Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when a payment is returned to you for any reason. 

c. 
Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the credit union, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request. 

d. 
Rush Fee. If your account is subject to a Rush Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each rush card that you request, providing delivery of the card is also available by standard mail service, without paying a fee for delivery. 


8. PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 3.50% of your total new 

DTXD40 (MXC500)-e 
balance, or $10.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, and any amount you are over your credit limit. In addition to the minimum payment, you must also pay, by the date specified above, the amount of any prior minimum payment(s) that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. 
9. 
PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate. 

10. 
SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. 


Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default. 
Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement. 
11. 
DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. 

When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe. 

12. 
LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION � You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at PO Box 58346, Houston, TX 77258 or telephone 866-692-9364 seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00. 

13. 
CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT � As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. 


Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized. 
The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account. 
14. 
CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS � Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user. If you cannot return the authorized user's card or access checks and if you request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for a new account. 

15. 
CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION � You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. If your account is eligible for emergency 



DTXD40 (MXC500)-e 
cash and/or emergency card replacement services, and you request such services, you agree that we may provide personal information about you and your account that is necessary to provide you with the requested service(s). 
16. 
RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS � Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6) months. 

17. 
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS � The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit Union is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time. 

18. 
MERCHANT DISPUTES � The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home. 

19. 
JOINT ACCOUNTS � If this is a joint account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may terminate the account and the termination will be effective as to all of you. 

20. 
EFFECT OF AGREEMENT � This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms. 

21. 
NO WAIVER � The Credit Union can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them. 

22. 
STATEMENTS AND NOTICES � Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the appropriate address you have given the Credit Union. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all.

� 	
Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why 


you believe it is a mistake. You must contact us: 
� 	
Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. 

� 	
At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount 


you think is wrong. You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 
When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 
1. 	
Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 

2. 	
Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is 


correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 
� 	
We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 

� 	
The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. 

� 	
While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. 


� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 
� 	
If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. 

� 	
If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. 


If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay.

We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.

Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases 
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. 
To use this right, all of the following must be true: 
1. 	
The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 

2. 	
You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 

3. 	
You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

JSC Federal Credit Union 
PO Box 58346

www.JSCFCU.org While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

Terms and Conditions
How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called ""average daily balance (including new purchases)"".
Billing Rights: Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided in this Cardholder Agreement.

You may pay the entire New Balance on your Account at any time.
NOTICE FOR MARRIED WISCONSIN RESIDENTS: No provision of a marital property agreement, unilateral statement under Section 766.59 of the Wisconsin Statutes, or court order under Section 766.70 of the Wisconsin Statutes adversely affects the interest of the creditor unless the creditor, prior to the time the credit is granted, is furnished a copy of the agreement, statement or decree or has actual knowledge of the adverse provision when the obligation to the creditor is incurred. If you are married, by submitting your credit card application you are confirming that this credit card obligation is being incurred in the interest of your marriage and your family. If the credit card for which you are applying is granted, you will notify the Bank if you have a spouse who needs to receive notification that credit has been extended to you.
CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
1. GENERAL: Each person signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application for a credit card account (“Account”) as applicant or joint applicant applies for an Account with HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., a national banking association, and requests one or more credit card(s) bearing the name or tradename of Guitar Center to be used in connection with the Account. The word “Card” means any credit card(s) issued to you or an authorized user of your Account. In this Agreement, the words “you” and “your” refer to the applicant and joint applicant named on the credit card application and the words “we”, “us” and “our” refer to HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., located at 1111 Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144.
If your application is approved, “applicant” will be referred to as “primary cardholder” and “joint applicant” will be referred to as “secondary cardholder” for purposes of this agreement.
If we accept your application to open an Account, you agree that you will only purchase goods and services for personal, family and household purposes from merchants which honor the Card.
2. ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT: By a) signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application, using or permitting others to use the Card, b) signing or permitting others to sign sales slips; or c) making or permitting others to make purchases by telephone, Internet, or any other means, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Cardholder Agreement and Disclosure Statement, which includes an arbitration provision.
3. PROMISE TO PAY: You agree to pay all amounts charged to the Account, whether incurred by you or anyone you authorize or permit to use your Account or Card. If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.
4. ABILITY TO REPAY: When you use the Account or permit others to use the Account, you represent that you have the ability and intention to repay all amounts charged to the Account.
5. BILLING STATEMENT: We will send you a billing statement monthly for each billing cycle at the end of which you have a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00, or in which a Interest Charge has been imposed. The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other charges or fees, including credit insurance or debt cancellation (if applicable), and all payments and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle. The billing statement will show the amount owed on your Account. The total Amount owed is called “New Balance” on your billing statement subject to the terms of Promotional Credit Plan purchases, if any, as indicated below.
6. PROMOTIONAL CREDIT PLANS: The following Promotional Credit Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase:   a) Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan – no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase for a specified period, as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; b) Same As Cash/Monthly Payment Credit Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase before the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, Interest Charges will be imposed from the purchase date; c) Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; d) Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan – A special repayment factor will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; e) Special Repayment Factor/Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A special repayment factor and a reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle. All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Credit Plan are referred to as Regular Credit Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Card. Call 1-888-367-4310 or review the Application of Payments section of this Agreement for information.
7. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(iv) a purchase on a Same As Cash Credit Plan if the full cash sales price is paid in full before the promotion expiration date.
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan other than a Same As Cash Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Same As Cash Credit Plan during a cycle, the amount will be the sum of the following daily Interest Charge calculations for the Credit Plan during the current cycle and during each of the prior billing cycles (each a “Prior Cycle”) from the transaction date of the purchase through the current cycle: (i) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for the Current Cycle times the Daily Balance for each day in the current cycle; and (ii) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for each Prior Cycle times the Daily Balances of the Credit Plan for each day during each Prior Cycle.
(e) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) incurred on that day and 4) any late fees, over the credit limit fees, returned payment fees or other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. For any Same As Cash Credit Plan, credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) are not included in the Daily Balance of that Credit Plan during the promotional period. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(f) The Daily Periodic Rate which is used to determine your Interest Charges and the corresponding Annual Percentage Rate, will be variable rates which may change monthly. The Daily Periodic Rate will be one-three hundred sixty fifth of the sum of the U.S. prime rate published in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal that is in effect on the last day of the month (“Prime Rate”) plus a “Spread” of 19.65 percentage points for the Standard Rate and a “Spread” of 23.65 percentage points for the Penalty Rate. Any changes in the Prime Rate will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle beginning in the next month. 
For example, as of the billing cycle beginning August 1, 2011, the Interest Charge for the Standard Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .06274% (corresponding 22.9% Annual Percentage Rate) and the Interest Charge for the Penalty Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .07370% (corresponding 26.9% Annual Percentage Rate). An increase in the Prime Rate will increase your applicable Daily Periodic Rate which may increase the Interest Charge and the Minimum Payment due on your Account. Your APR may increase to the Penalty APR if we fail to receive your minimum payment with in 60 days when due. You will no longer be eligible for the Standard Rate and all existing Promotional Credit Plans will terminate, and your entire Account balance will be subject to the Penalty Rate. If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the new Penalty APR goes into effect.  If you make the next six consecutive on time minimum payments starting with your first payment due once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APR(s) applicable to your Account.  If you do not make these six consecutive on time minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.
8. MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE: A minimum Interest Charge of $2.00 will be assessed for each billing cycle in which an Interest Charge is payable.
9. FEES: We may impose on your Account the following fees, which will be added to your Account when assessed:
a)	Late Payment Fee: A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
	The amount of the Late Payment Fee is shown in the chart below.  In no event will your Late Payment Fee exceed the amount of your Minimum Payment Due.
Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - Up to and including $100
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $19
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $19

b)	Returned Payment Fee: A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
	Your Returned Payment Fee is $25.
	In no event will your Returned Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
c)	Research Fees: A Research Fee may be assessed to the Account for each copy of a requested document. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such copies are requested..
d)	Reissued Card Fee: You may be charged $5 each time you request that your credit card be reissued.

f)	Over the Credit Limit Fee:  In the event you exceed your credit limit, you will be charged an Over the Credit Limit Fee of $0.
g)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
10. INSURANCE: If available and you elect any credit insurance coverage, you authorize us to charge the insurance premium for such insurance to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the insurance premium is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the premium is being assessed. Credit insurance charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
11. DEBT CANCELLATION: If available and you elect debt cancellation, you authorize us to charge the fee for such debt cancellation to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the debt cancellation fee is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the fee is being assessed. Debt cancellation charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
12. MINIMUM PAYMENT: You agree to pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due. Your Minimum Payment due is equal to your Minimum Payment plus the Special Repayment Factor for any Promotional Credit Plans with a special repayment factor plus any debt cancellation fees or credit insurance premiums attributable to any Reduced Rate/Special Repayment Factor Credit plans plus any delinquent amounts. The Minimum Payment is the greater of a.) $25 or b.) 1% of your “New Balance” (which does not include balances on Special Repayment Factor Credit Plans) plus billed Interest Charges plus any Late Fees assessed for that month, rounded to the next highest dollar. Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments, which may affect crediting of your payments.
13. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) not drawn in U.S. dollars on funds on deposit in the U.S.; (b) missing a signature; (c) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (d) restrictively endorsed; (e) postdated; (f) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (g) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to HSBC Retail Services, P.O. Box 5226, Carol Stream, IL 60197-5226. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
14. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances.  If you have a Same As Cash Credit Plan(s), we will automatically apply payments received during the final two complete billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first to the required Minimum Payment Due and next to the plan(s) that is expiring, in the order of expiration; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0% APR for purposes of determining payment application.
15. CREDIT LIMIT: You agree not to let the Account balance exceed the credit limit established for you by us from time to time. We do not have to honor any use of your Card or honor credit card checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit, but if we do, you agree to repay the amount by which your credit limit is exceeded, plus Interest Charges immediately.
16. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of any merchant to accept or honor the Card or a credit card check.
17. SECURITY: Except as indicated below, you grant us a purchase money security interest in the goods purchased with your Card and in all insurance contracts and all proceeds, returned premiums,mechanical failure and extended service contracts, and refunds of charges for mechanical failure and extended service contracts financed therewith. Each good purchased on your Account will secure the entire Account balance until such good is paid in full. For purposes of determining which goods are subject to a security interest, payments received will be deemed to be applied first to any unpaid insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable), Interest Charges and fees and then to pay for purchases on the Account in the order in which they were made. When sufficient payments are made to repay the portion of the Account balance attributable to the purchase of a particular good, we will release our purchase money security interest in that good. Goods covered by a security interest may be taken from you if you do not pay on time. We may require you to make them available at a convenient place of our choice. We take no security interest in goods where the original purchase price is less than $200 if you live in New York and in goods where the original purchase price is less than $700 if you live in Maryland. If we repossess any goods purchased with your Card, we may charge you our repossession cost including, but not limited to, necessary repairs, storage fees and costs of sale, when and as permitted by law.
18. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Total Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your moving out of the U.S. or Canada or providing us with a non-U.S. or non-Canadian mailing address; (l) your becoming incompetent; (m) your exceeding your credit limit; (n) your payment being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (o) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (p) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.

If a Claim that is within the scope of the first paragraph of the “Claims and Arbitration Administrators” paragraph above is advanced by or against any third person, and any of the persons mentioned in the previous sentence is involved as a party, then the entire Claim is subject to arbitration under this Agreement, including any Claim by or against any third person.
Protection of Information
The rules and procedures of the Administrator, which you may obtain from that organization, shall govern the arbitration unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will control. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, nor to state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. If you or we request, the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized under applicable law and will use best efforts to protect confidential information (including through use of protective orders).
Parties to Arbitration
Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.”
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver.  You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules. In the event of such an appeal, an appeal panel consisting of three arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The panel's decision will be final and binding. Any final decision of the arbitrator or of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as provided under the FAA. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the FAA by any court having jurisdiction.
Consequences of Electing Arbitration
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY W",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

Visa Classic, Visa Platinum, Visa Platinum Choice Rewards, Visa Platinum Secured, and Visa Platinum Student 
Credit Card Agreement and Truth in Lending Disclosure 

Effective November 2010

In this Agreement and Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement (�agreement�) the words �you �your� and �cardholder� mean each and all of those who apply for or use the card and or Visa account.  �We�, �us�, �our,� and �credit union� mean California Coast Credit Union. �Account� and �card� mean the Visa Classic, Visa Platinum, Visa Platinum Choice Rewards, Visa Platinum Secured, and Visa Platinum Student credit card, unless otherwise specified.

You agree to the following terms and conditions and any changes or amendments.  By requesting and receiving, signing or permitting others to use the card issued to you by the credit union, you agree to the following terms.
Acceleration and Collection Costs You understand and agree that we have the right to temporarily or permanently suspend any and all account and card privileges and/or may demand immediate payment of the unpaid balance, interest charges, late charges, our collection costs, reasonable attorney�s fees, and court costs (collectively, �collection-related charges�) in the event of (a) your death, insolvency, or failure to pay this obligation or any of your other obligations to us, or (b) any breach or default of this agreement.  You understand and agree that you will be subject to interest charges (at the applicable Annual Percentage Rate), late charges, and collection-related charges under the terms disclosed in this agreement until you repay your entire loan.
Accuracy of Information The information provided in your application for credit is accurate and you will notify us in writing immediately if there is a change in your financial condition. The credit union may retain the application.  You understand that it is a violation of Section 1014, title 18, US Code to make false statements or over value security for the purpose of influencing the action of any federally-insured credit union.  We may gather credit and or employment information we deem necessary and appropriate from time to time and we may give information concerning our credit experience with you to others.
Authorization and Payment You authorize us to pay and charge your account for all purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers, made or obtained by you or another you authorize to use your card or account.  You will be obligated to pay all such purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers charged to your account whether resulting from: (1) actual use of your card or Visa convenience checks; (2) mail order, telephone, computer, or other electronic purchases made without presenting the card; or (3) any other circumstances where you authorize a charge, or authorize someone else to make a charge on your account (collectively, authorized charges). You promise to pay us, or to our order, in US dollars with an instrument drawn on a financial institution in the United Sates at our offices or at the address set forth on your periodic statement, all authorized charges on the terms and at the rates set forth herein, plus any interest charges assessed on your account and any other charges and fees which you may owe us under the terms of this agreement.  Payments will continue until you have paid in full the unpaid balance, interest charges, all collections related charges and any other fees and charges.
California Coast Guard Plus Credit protection coverage under this program is optional. The cost of coverage is added to the balance of the loan monthly as a cash advance transaction. The cash advance fee is waived.  If you do not make any payment when due, at our option, we may cancel coverage. 
California Law This agreement is made in California and is governed by the laws of the state of California to the extent that California law is not inconsistent with controlling federal law.  California�s choice of law rules shall not be applied if that would result in the application of non-California law.
Cardholder Signature To avoid fraud if your card is lost or stolen, and to allow Point of Sale (POS) merchants to verify the signature on sales drafts, you must sign the signature panel on the back of your card immediately for the card to be valid. Do not write, �See ID� or similar content on the signature panel, as this is not an acceptable alternative.
Cash Advances Cash advances may be obtained at ATMs, through a California Coast Visa convenience check, overdraft transfer, Cal Coast ONLINE or at a financial institution (without using an ATM). There is a fee for each cash advance. 
Change in Terms This agreement is the contract that applies to all transactions on the account even though the sales, cash advance, credit, or other receipts/slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.  You understand and agree that the credit union may amend, modify, add to, or delete from this agreement any of its terms and conditions, by mailing or delivering a notice of the change to you at your last known address.  You also understand that any such notice will be sent at least 45 days prior to the effective date of the change, as required by federal or other law.  Notice of a change in terms is required, but may be sent as late as the effective date of the change where the change has been agreed to, in writing, by you.
Change of Name, Address, Telephone Number or Employment Status You understand and agree that you must report to the credit union any change in your name, address, telephone number, or employment status.
Credit Information You authorize us to investigate your credit standing when applying for, renewing, or reviewing your account and you authorize us to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and other creditors who inquire to us regarding your credit standing to the extent authorized by law.
Credit Limit Except as may be limited by applicable law, we at our sole discretion, may increase or decrease your credit limit by any amount.  We may also refuse to extend additional credit for any transaction if you have reached your credit limit or if you are in default.
Default If you are in default under this agreement, we have the right to terminate further services on your account, to revoke your card and/or demand payment in full of all amounts owed to us.  You will be in default if any of the following occur: 1) If you do not pay on time or in the proper amount; 2) you fail to live up to the terms of this agreement; 3) your credit worthiness is impaired; 4) you die, become insolvent, or are the subject of bankruptcy or receivership proceedings; 5) if we receive any verbal or written report from any of your creditors that you have not met your obligations with any of them.  In the event of any action by us to enforce this agreement, you agree to pay the costs of reasonable attorney fees, and other expenses.  interest charges will continue to accrue until you repay your loan.
Delay in Enforcement We can delay enforcing any of our rights under this agreement without losing them.
Delinquency When your account is fifteen (15) or more days delinquent, and you have made no attempt to contact us to make agreeable arrangements for payment, we may cancel/decline all authorizations until your account is brought current.
Electronic Funds Transfer If the use of your card or account number constitutes an Electronic Funds Transfer, the terms and conditions of the Electronic Services Disclosure and Agreement will govern these transactions to the extent that the EFT agreement amends this agreement.
Fees Fees associated with the use of the card are disclosed on the Visa Credit Card Disclosure Summary you receive when you open your account.
Foreign Transactions The exchange rate between the foreign transaction currency and the billing currency (US dollars) used for processing international transactions may be either:  1) a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which may vary from the rate Visa receives, or 2) the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date.  In each instance, Visa charges an International Service Assessment fee for Multiple Currency Conversion Rate adjustments. If there is no currency conversion, Visa charges a Single Currency Conversion Rate adjustment fee.
Integrated Documents Any separate sheet of paper labeled �Additional Disclosure � Truth-in-Lending Act� which is delivered together with this form is an integrated part of the agreement.
Interest Charge Calculation (Average daily balance method including current transactions) We calculate the interest charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your account. To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases, advances, and fees, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the �average daily balance.� 
Lien on Shares If you have voluntarily agreed to a lien on shares, you understand that if you are in default on the account, we may apply all shares (except IRA accounts) then on deposit needed by the credit union to repay your loan.
Lost or Stolen Cards You must notify the credit union at once if you believe your card, account number, PIN or any combination of the three has been lost or stolen by immediately calling the credit union at the telephone number at the back of this disclosure.  Telephoning is the best way to keep possible losses down. You understand that you shall not be liable to the credit union for any account and or card transaction resulting from the loss, theft or other unauthorized use of the account and or card that occurs prior to the time you give notice to the credit union.  Such liability does not apply when the account and or card is used to make an electronic funds transfer. We may increase the limit of your liability for unauthorized Visa transactions only if we reasonably determine based on substantial evidence that you were grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handling of your account or card.
Membership Requirement You understand and agree that you must be and remain a member in good standing with the credit union to be eligible for continuing account and/or card privileges including future purchases and advances.  You understand and agree that we may suspend the account and/or card privileges during any period in which you do not maintain your membership with us.
Merchant Disputes We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor the account and/or card.  The credit union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card only if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the credit union sent or participated in sending you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50 and was made from a plan merchant in your state or within $100 miles of your current mailing address.  Any other dispute you must resolve directly with the plan merchant.
Negative Credit Information A negative credit report, reflecting on your credit record, may be submitted to a credit reporting agency if you fail to fulfill the terms of your credit obligations.
Payment Due Date Payments are due on the 25th day of each month.  If your Payment Due Date falls on a weekend or holiday, a mailed payment received by the close of business on the next business day will be considered timely. For example, if the due date is Sunday the 25th, the payment received by mail will be on time if received before the close of business on Monday, the 26th. 
Payment Marked �Paid in Full� The credit union may accept checks, money orders, or other types of payment marked �payment in full� or using other language to indicate full satisfaction of any indebtedness, without being bound by such language or waiving any rights under this agreement. Full satisfaction of indebtedness shall be accepted by the credit union only in a written agreement, signed by an authorized representative.
Payment Minimum Every month, you must pay at least the minimum payment due by the payment due date shown on your periodic statement.  The minimum payment due will be either (a) 3% of the new balance, or $25, whichever is greater; or (b) your new balance if it is less than $25. In addition, you must pay any amount on your periodic statement listed as past due and any late charge.  Lastly, if at any time, your new balance exceeds your credit limit, you must pay the excess as well as any over limit charge.
Preauthorized Payment By separate agreement, you may authorize the credit union to automatically transfer the minimum payment due from your savings or checking account.  You may pay more frequently, pay more, or pay the new balance in full which will reduce your interest charge.  
Prepayment or Irregular Payments Though you need only pay the minimum payment due, you understand that you have the right to repay your loan at any time without penalty.  You also understand and agree that you will only be charged interest charges to the date you repay your entire loan.  You may make larger payments without penalty and this may reduce the total amount of interest charges that you will repay.  If you pay more than the minimum payment due in any month and there is still a balance due, you must continue to make minimum payments in future months.  Any partial payment of your loan will not advance your next payment due date. You understand and agree that any payment that delays or accelerates the repayment of your unpaid balance will increase or decrease your interest charge.
Privacy Notice The credit union may release information about you and your account in connection with the maintenance of your account with outside companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements, or as required or allowed by law.  For example:  If you are in default, we may release information about your account to third parties who may assist us in enforcing our rights under this agreement.  We may also report, to credit reporting agencies and other creditors, the status and payment history of your account, including negative credit information. If you believe that our report of your account status is inaccurate or incomplete, write us at the following address: California Coast Credit Union, P.O. Box 502080, San Diego, CA 92150-2080.  You must include your name, address, home telephone number, and account number. 
Purchases and Cash Advances You may make purchases and request advances in accordance with current loan policies up to your credit limit.  You understand and agree that all purchases and other transactions requested by you or anyone you have permitted to use the card and or account are subject to credit union approval.
Personal Identification Number (PIN) The credit union may assign you a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to be used with your card.  You agree not to disclose or otherwise make your PIN available to anyone not authorized on your account.  This number should be memorized and then destroyed to ensure that no one else can obtain access.  You must not write your PIN on the card and must not record your PIN anywhere or in any form (even disguised) that could be accessed by an unauthorized person.  If you forget your PIN, you must contact us and a new PIN will be issued, or you may visit a credit union branch office to select your own PIN.
Responsibility You agree to repay, according to the terms of this agreement, all purchases/other debits, cash advances, balance transfers, interest charged, and any other fees and charges, if any, arising from the use of the account by you or any other person you permit to use the account, even if that person exceeds your permission.  For example, you are responsible for charges made by yourself, your spouse, and minor children.  You cannot disclaim responsibility by notifying us, but upon your request and upon the return of all cards to the credit union you must close the account to prevent any new transactions from being authorized.  Your obligation to pay the account balance continues even though an agreement, divorce decree, or other court judgment to which you are not a party may direct you or one of the other persons responsible to pay the account.  Any person using the card is jointly and severally responsible with you for all charges he or she makes, but if that individual signed the card, he or she becomes a party to this agreement and is also jointly and severally responsible for all charges on the account, including your charges.
Restricted Use of the Card Your card and or account may not be used directly or indirectly for: (1) any illegal activity or transaction, or (2) any gambling, gaming, betting, or similar activity or transaction.  Further, you may not utilize your card and or account for the purchase of any goods or services on the Internet that involve gambling, gaming, betting, or any similar transaction or activity.  Such transactions include, but may not be limited to, any quasi-cash or online gambling transaction, any electronic commerce transaction conducted over an open network, and any betting transaction including the purchase of lottery tickets or casino gaming chips/checks or off-track betting or wagering.  Your use of the card and or account for any such transaction will constitute an event of default under this agreement. However, in the event that a charge or transaction described in this paragraph is approved and processed, you will still be responsible for such charges.  You agree that the credit union will not incur any liability, responsibility or culpability whatsoever, for any such use of the card and or account by you or any authorized users. You further agree to indemnify and hold the credit union harmless from any suits, liability damages, or adverse action of any kind that results directly or indirectly from such use.
Returns and Adjustments Merchants and others who honor the account and/or card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the credit union a credit receipt/slip which will post to the account.  If your credit and payments exceed what you owe the credit union, we will hold and apply this credit balance against future purchases and cash advances, or if it is one dollar or more, refund it upon your written request or automatically after six months.
Visa Platinum Secured Credit Cards 
Pledge of Shares The Visa Platinum Secured Credit Card (Visa credit card) is secured by the shares in the share account described in the �Visa Platinum Secured Credit Card Request�. By requesting and receiving, signing or permitting others to use the Visa credit card issued to you by California Coast Credit Union, you agree that your assignment and pledge of your share account is irrevocable except as provided for in this agreement.  By pledging your share account, you agree that if you are in default under this agreement, in addition to all the other remedies under this agreement, we may, at our option, apply the balance of the pledged share account to the outstanding balance of your Visa credit card. You understand the applicable Annual Percentage Rate disclosed in the Visa Credit Card Disclosure Summary does not take into account the dividends on the pledged share account. 
Pledged Share Account Requirements You agree to maintain a minimum balance in the pledged share account in an amount equal to 120% of the credit limit on the Visa credit card.  If the balance in the pledged share account ever falls below this minimum requirement, you agree to immediately deposit to the pledged share account an amount sufficient to cause the balance in the account to satisfy this minimum balance requirement. You agree that this pledge will cover future purchases and advances under this agreement.  
Closing the Account You may not close your pledged share account until the outstanding balance of the Visa credit card has been paid in full and closed. If the credit union or you cancel the Visa credit card, the credit union reserves the right to hold the funds on deposit in the pledged share account for a period of time (but not more than 30 days after the Visa credit card account is closed), which we believe reasonably sufficient for any outstanding credit card drafts to clear.
Surrender of Cards The cards(s) remain credit union property and if we request and/or upon termination of the account, you must recover and surrender to us all cards(s) and any other access devices we have issued on the account.
Termination We may terminate this agreement upon your default.  Either party may terminate this agreement for other good cause.  If this agreement is terminated, you must discontinue utilization of the account by any means.  In no event shall any termination relieve you of your obligations to repay sums already borrowed, interest charged, and any other fees and charges, if any, arising from the use of the account.
Transaction Receipts/Slips Your periodic statement will identify the merchant, electronic terminal, or financial institutions at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advance, credit, or other receipts cannot be returned with the periodic statement.  You must retain the copy of such receipts furnished at the time of the transaction to verify information on your periodic statement.  
Unauthorized Usage You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your card and or account.  You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you immediately notify us of the loss, theft or possible unauthorized use by calling us at: (877) 495-1600 or writing us at: Attention: Support Services Department, California Coast Credit Union, P.O. Box 502080, San Diego, CA 92150-2080.  In any case, your liability for unauthorized use may be $0 in accordance with current Visa U.S.A. Operating Regulations.  You agree to assist us in determining the facts and circumstances relating to any such unauthorized usage.
Using the Visa Card or Account Number 
1. Present the card to a Visa plan merchant, to California Coast Credit Union, or another financial institution displaying the Visa logo, and sign the sales or cash advance draft.  
2. Give the card number for mail, telephone order transactions, or for purchases through the Internet.  Use caution when making purchases in this manner.  
3. By using your PIN number with the card in an ATM or other electronic terminal that provides access to the Visa system. 
4. By using �CoastLine� or by using �Cal Coast ONLINE� through the Internet.  
5. Cover overdrafts from your checking account pursuant to authorizing Overdraft Protection.

Your Billing Rights
Keep this Document for Future Use

This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.
What to Do If You Find a Mistake on Your Statement
If you think there is an error on your statement, you must write to us at:
California Coast Credit Union
P.O. Box 502080
San Diego, CA 92150-2080
You may also contact us on the Web at www.calcoastcu.org.
In your letter, you must give us the following information:
* Account information: Your name and account number.
* Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
* Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us:
* Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
* At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
* We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
* The charge in question may remain on your statement and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
* While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
* We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
* If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
* If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your account do not qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, you must contact us in writing at:
California Coast Credit Union
P.O. Box 502080
San Diego, CA 92150-2080 
You may also contact us on the Web at www.calcoastcu.org.
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called �daily balance�. 

During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying 
the periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following 
balance types, as applicable: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or 
special promotions. 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees 
posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 

� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type.

GE MONEY BANK 
CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT 


1. CONTRACT. This Agreement (�Agreement�) is a contract for the extension of credit. It controls your credit card account referenced on the document received with your credit card or 
on your welcome letter. This Agreement includes this document and the following documents: 
� The application or any other document you submitted to us in connection with the account; and 
� The privacy policy that is enclosed with or attached to this document. 
By opening or using your account, you agree to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement starts when (i) you give us an account application we approve or (ii) you use your account or 
let someone else use it, whichever occurs first. 

2. PARTIES. The parties to this Agreement are you and GE Money Bank. GE Money Bank is located at 170 West Election Road, Suite 125, Draper, Utah 84020. GE Money Bank 
sometimes is called �us,� �we� or �our� in this Agreement. 

3. PROMISE TO PAY. You promise to pay us for all credit that we extend on your account, including credit extended when you let another person use your account. You also promise to 
pay us for all other amounts owed to us under this Agreement. 

4. CHANGING TERMS. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may change, add to or delete any of the terms of this Agreement, including the interest rates, 
fees and charges. 

5. GOVERNING LAW. Except as provided in the Dispute and Claim Resolution (Including Arbitration) provision, this Agreement and your account are governed by federal 
law and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of Utah without regard to its conflicts of law principles. This Agreement has been accepted by us in Utah. 

6. CREDIT CARD. We have issued or will send you a credit card for your use. You are not permitted to allow anyone else to use your credit card, but if you do, you will be responsible 
for such use. You will destroy all the credit card(s) issued on your account if we ask you to do so. 

7. AUTHORIZED USER/JOINT ACCOUNT. If you ask us to send a credit card to another person that you want to let use your account, you will be responsible for all transactions made 
by that person. That person will be considered an authorized user. If another person is approved on the account, that person will be considered a joint accountholder. Each joint 
accountholder may use the account and agrees to the terms of this Agreement. No matter which joint accountholder uses the account, each of you must pay back the full amount owed 
on the account. We may treat each of you as one accountholder. For example, giving notice to one of you is considered the same as giving notice to both of you. Also, we may follow the 
instructions that we get from one of you even if they differ from instructions given by the other accountholder. 

8. USING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may use your account only as stated in this Agreement. You may use your account for the following: 
� Purchases. You may buy goods or services; 
� Cash Advances. If applicable, you may get cash advances by writing convenience checks we may provide to you from time to time or by other means we may make available. We 
may not honor a convenience check (i) if you filed for bankruptcy, (ii) if the check is expired, (iii) if your account is closed, (iv) if the amount of the check would exceed your available 
credit or cash advance limit, or (v) as otherwise stated on your convenience check; and 
� Balance Transfers. If applicable, from time to time, we may offer you the chance to transfer balances from your other credit card accounts to this account. Unless we tell you 
otherwise, we will treat balance transfers as purchases. We reserve the right to decline to process any balance transfer request for any reason, and will not transfer a balance from 
any of our affiliates. Transfers will be processed in the order determined by us. If the amount you wish to transfer is greater than your available credit limit, we may reject the 
request(s). It may take up to four weeks for a balance transfer request to be credited to your other credit card account(s). It is your responsibility to make any payments required to 
keep your other account(s) current and to close your other account(s), if you desire. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur on your other account(s) as a result of 
your balance transfer(s). If you have a dispute with a creditor, and pay the balance in question by transferring it to your account, you may lose certain dispute rights. 
You may use your account only for lawful personal, family or household purposes. You may not use your account for internet gambling or illegal purposes. You may not use your account 
to pay amounts you owe us on this account or on other accounts you have with us. These restrictions are for our benefit, and we are not responsible to you for enforcing them. 

9. CREDIT AND CASH ADVANCE LIMITS. 
A. Assigning Limits. We will assign the following limit(s) on your account, as applicable. We may increase or decrease either or both of these limits at any time. 
Credit Limit � This is the highest amount of total credit we will extend to you on your account. 

Cash Advance Limit � This is the highest amount of credit we will extend to you for cash advances made on your account, if applicable. Cash transactions will also count 
towards your credit limit. 

B. Exceeding Limits. We may refuse to authorize you to use your account if that use (including any fees associated with that use) will cause the total you will owe on your account to 
be more than your credit limit. If applicable, you may not get a cash advance if that cash advance (including interest and cash advance fees) will cause the total you will owe for 
cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit. If we approve a transaction that causes the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit 
limit or, if applicable, the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit, we do not give up any of our rights under this Agreement 
and we do not treat it as an increase in your credit limit or, if applicable, cash advance limit. 

C. Limiting Transactions. We reserve the right to not approve transactions on your account. To prevent fraud, we may also limit the number or dollar amount of transactions you can 
make in a particular amount of time. 

10. INTEREST. This section explains (i) the interest rates that will apply to your account, (ii) when interest will be charged on your account, and (iii) how the amount of interest is calculated. 
A. Rates. The following rates apply to purchases and, if applicable, cash advances. A higher rate, which we call a �Penalty APR� may apply at certain times as described below. The 
Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account are shown in the table above and will also be shown on your billing statement. 
We calculate interest on the balance of your account each day. We use a daily rate to calculate the interest each day. The daily rate is equal to the APR divided by 365. 

1. Purchase Rate. The daily rate for purchases is .06572% (APR 23.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
2. Cash Advance Rate. The daily rate for cash advances is .08216% (APR 29.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
3. Penalty Rate. The penalty rate may apply if you do not make your total minimum payment by the payment due date and will continue to apply as provided in this section. As 
required by law, we will provide you with advance notice if we are going to apply the penalty rate to your account and we will tell you when the penalty rate will apply. 
a. What is the Penalty Rate? The daily penalty rate will be .08216% (APR 29.99%). 
b. How Long Will the Penalty Rate Apply? If you are not more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to transactions made on your account after a date 
specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make all required payments by the payment due date for six consecutive billing periods, your rate will return to the 
standard APR; otherwise, the penalty rate will apply indefinitely. 

If you are or become more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to all balances and new transactions on your account not already subject to the penalty 
rate as specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make six consecutive minimum payments by the payment due date, starting with your first payment due 
date after the date specified in the advance notice, your rate for any balances created on your account prior to or within 14 days after the date of the advance notice 
that are not already subject to (or scheduled under a prior notice to be subject to) the penalty rate will return to the standard APR. If you do not make these six consecutive 
minimum payments, we may apply the penalty rate to all balances on your account indefinitely. 

B. When We Charge Interest. 
1. Purchases. We charge interest on your purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full, except as set forth below: 
� We will not charge you interest during a billing cycle on any purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the billing cycle or (ii) you had such a balance, you paid 
that balance in full by the due date in that billing cycle. 
� We will credit, as of the beginning of the billing cycle, any payment you make by the due date that we allocate to purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the 
previous billing cycle, or (ii) if you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in the previous billing cycle. 

2. Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. If applicable, we charge interest on your balance transfers and cash advances (and their related fees) from the date you make the 
transaction until you pay them in full. You cannot avoid paying interest on balance transfers or cash advances or on their fees. 

C. How We Calculate Interest. During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the 
periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types, as applicable: 
purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 
� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract 
any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. We charge a minimum of $2 of 
interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest. 

11. FEES. We may charge some or all of the following fees. The table at the beginning of this Agreement shows the amount of each of the maintenance, transaction and penalty fees. 
A. A monthly Maintenance Fee each month your account is open and has a balance greater than zero. 

B. Transaction Fees. 
1. A Balance Transfer Fee for each balance transfer you make. 
2. A Cash Advance Fee for each cash advance you get. 
3. A Promotional Fee related to certain special promotions. For fixed payment promotions, the promotional fee will not be added to the purchase balance for calculation of 
the total minimum payment due; the fee must be paid as part of the promotional balance. The fee will be included in the purchase balance for all other promotions and must 
be paid as part of promotional balance. 

C. Penalty Fees. 
1. A Late Payment Fee if we do not receive at least the total minimum payment due on your account by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the due date shown on your statement. The amount 
of the late payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if you have paid at least your total minimum payment due by the payment due date in each of the prior six billing cycles or 
(2) $35 if you have failed to pay at least the total minimum payment due by the payment due date in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the late 
payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for which the late payment fee is assessed, the amount of the late payment fee will instead be equal to the 
amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 
2. A Returned Payment Fee if any check or other instrument sent to us, or any electronic payment authorization you provide us in payment on your account, is not honored 
upon first presentment, even if the check, instrument or electronic authorization is later honored. The amount of the returned payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if 
your payments have been honored upon first presentment in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any payment has been dishonored upon first presentment in any 
one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the returned payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for the cycle in which the payment was dishonored 
upon first presentment, the amount of the returned payment fee will instead be equal to the amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

D. Other Fees. 
1. A Returned Convenience Check Fee of up to $35 if we do not honor a convenience check because (i) it will cause you to go over your cash advance limit, (ii) you filed a 
petition in bankruptcy, (iii) the check is expired, or (iv) your account is closed. The amount of the returned convenience check fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if your convenience 
checks have been honored in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any convenience check has been dishonored in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. 
However, if the returned convenience check fee would exceed the amount of the dishonored convenience check, the amount of the returned convenience check fee will 
instead be equal to the amount of the dishonored convenience check. 

2. A Stop Payment Fee of $39.99 if we stop payment on any convenience check at your request. 

12. YOUR PAYMENTS. 
A. Required Payment and Crediting of Payment. Each billing cycle you must pay at least the total minimum payment by 5:00 pm (ET) on the payment due date. You may at any time pay more than the total minimum payment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payment may reduce the 
amount of interest you will pay. Any payments received after 5:00 pm (ET) will be credited as of the next day. We may delay making credit available 
on your account in the amount of your payment. 

B. Minimum Payment. Your total minimum payment is the greatest of (a) $35, (b) 2.5% of your highest New Balance for the life of your account, or (c) 
the interest and late payment fees billed on your statement plus $20. As used in this paragraph, �new balance� excludes any balance attributable to 
any special promotion that involves delayed or special payments. We round up to the next highest whole dollar in figuring your total minimum 
payment. If your new balance on your billing statement is less than $35, then your total minimum payment will be equal to the new balance. 

C. How to Make a Payment. To make a payment you must follow all the instructions below and the instructions on your billing statement. If you do not follow these instructions, credit 
of your payment to your account may be delayed up to five days. 

1. Do the following: (a) make your payment in United States dollars by check, money order, or similar instrument from a bank located in the U.S; (b) send the payment coupon 
from your billing statement with your payment; (c) send the payment and payment coupon in the envelope provided with your billing statement to the payment address listed on 
your billing statement; and (d) send only one payment and one payment coupon in each envelope. Alternatively you may make your payment online at the website address 
shown on your billing statement provided you make your payment in United States dollars from a bank located in the U.S. 
2. Do not do the following: (a) staple, paper clip, tape or fold your payment or payment coupon; (b) include any other papers or items with your payment; (c) use a balance 
transfer or convenience check from your account to pay us; or (d) send us cash. 

D. Other Ways to Make a Payment. Certain participating stores or providers may take payments that you make to them as a convenience to you. We may not credit those payments 
to your account until we receive them. We may allow you to make payments over the phone as an accommodation to you, but we may charge you a fee to do so. 

E. Disputed Amounts. If you send us correspondence about a disputed amount, you must send it to the address for billing inquiries shown on your billing statement. 
You may not send it to the payment address shown on your billing statement. By �disputed amount,� we mean a payment of less than the full balance on your account 
that is labeled as �payment in full� or similar language, or is given to us as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, or is given to us with other conditions or limitations. 
We may accept these types of payments without giving up any of our rights. 

F. Authorization. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or 
to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon 
as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. 

G. Payment Allocation. We reserve the right to select the method by which the required minimum payment is allocated to different balances on your account. Some or all of the 
required minimum payment on your account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. The payment allocation method that we use may result in higher 
interest on your account or reduced savings attributable to any special promotions. Any payment you make in excess of the required minimum payment will be allocated to 
balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs, unless applicable law requires or permits otherwise (such as when your account has a certain type of special 
promotion). 

13. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS. At times, we may offer you special promotions when you use your account for certain transactions. These special promotions will have some terms that 
are different from the terms in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement apply to any special promotion, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the special promotion. We 
may terminate your participation in any special promotion and/or apply the penalty rate to your account balances (including special promotion balances) if you become more than 60 days 
late on any payment due on your account. If this happens, each special promotion balance will no longer be subject to the terms of the special promotion and will instead be subject to the 
terms of this Agreement. A promotional charge may be charged as part of a special promotion. Please see any special promotion advertising (including in-store signs) or other disclosures 
provided to you for the full terms of any special promotion offered. 

14. SECURITY INTEREST. You grant us a purchase money security interest in each item of merchandise purchased on your account to secure its unpaid purchase price until such 
merchandise is paid in full. Solely for the purpose of determining the extent of our purchase money security interest in each such item of merchandise, your payments will be allocated 
first to interest on the account, and then to pay off each purchase on the account in the order in which the purchase was made (if more than one item was purchased on the same day, 
your payments will be allocated to pay off the lowest priced item first). If you made a purchase pursuant to a credit promotion, the balance with respect to the promotional purchase may 
be shown on statements during the promotional period and may reflect a different payment allocation method. In no event will we assert a security interest in the promotional purchase for 
an amount greater than the lowest balance shown on a statement for that promotional purchase. We agree that no security interest is or will be retained or acquired under this agreement 
in any real property which is used or is expected to be used as your dwelling. Should we feel it necessary, you authorize us to sign and file financing statements regarding any vehicle 
purchased. 

For some individual purchases under your account, we may require you to maintain property/casualty insurance on the purchase as a condition of granting you credit. You will be 
informed of any property/casualty insurance requirement at the time you make the purchase. 

15. UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should call us immediately at 1-800-250-5411. 
You will not be liable for any unauthorized use on your account. 

You agree that unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given your card or allowed use of your account. You will be responsible for all use by such a 
person. 

16. YOUR CREDIT REPORTS AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION. 
A. Using and Sharing Your Information. When you applied for an account you gave us information about yourself. You also agreed that we could ask others for information about 
your creditworthiness and that we could ask consumer reporting agencies for your consumer report. We use this information in considering your application. We also use this 
information for any updates, renewals or extensions of credit on your account. We use this information to review and collect your account. We use this information to provide you 
with offers. We may give information about you or your account to consumer reporting agencies and other proper parties. This information may include your performance under this 
Agreement. 
B. Inaccurate Information. Tell us if you think we reported wrong information about you to a consumer reporting agency (also called a credit bureau). Write to us at P.O. 
Box 981439, El Paso, TX 79998-1439. In your written communication, tell us what information is wrong and why you think it is wrong. If you have a copy of the credit 
report that includes the wrong information, send a copy of it with your written communication. We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late 
payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. 

17. USE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOUR ACCOUNT. We will give information about you and your account to dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals 
that accept this credit card (and their affiliates) and you consent to this. Dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals will use the information in connection with the credit 
card program and for things like creating and updating their records and offering you special benefits. We will use information about you and your account as set forth in the privacy policy 
that is attached to or enclosed with this document. 

18. CHANGE OF ADDRESS/PHONE NUMBER. You agree to tell us right away if you change your address or phone number(s). We will contact you at the address in our records until 
we are able to update our records with your new address. 

19. CONSENT TO COMMUNICATIONS. You consent to us contacting you using all channels of communication and for all purposes (including collection purposes), using all contact 
information you provide to us. You also consent to us and any other owner or servicer of your account contacting you about your account, including using text messages, any automatic 
telephone dialing system and/or an artificial or prerecorded voice when contacting you, even if you are charged for the call under your phone plan. You are responsible for any charges for 
contacting you that may be billed to you by your communications carriers. 

20. TELEPHONE MONITORING. For quality control purposes, you permit us to listen to or record telephone calls between you and us. 

21. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. 
A. When You May Close Your Account. You may close your account at any time by writing or calling us and asking us to close your account. You must send this writing to the 
address shown on your billing statement or call us at the customer service number shown on your billing statement. We will close your account after we get your request. 
B. When We May Close Your Account. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may close your account at any time and for any reason. 
C. After You or We Close Your Account. 
If you or we close your account, you must stop using it. You will still have to pay us the full amount you owe on your account. This 
Agreement controls your account until you pay it in full. 

22. DEFAULT. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, you are in default if you: 
� Make a late payment; 
� Do not follow any other term of this Agreement; or 
� Become bankrupt or insolvent. 
If you default or upon your death, we may, subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law: (i) make the full amount owing on your account due right away; (ii) bring a legal 
action to collect all amounts owed; and/or (iii) take any action allowed by law. We may also reduce your credit limit or close your account at any time whether or not you are in default. 

23. COLLECTION COSTS. If we ask an attorney to collect your account, we may charge you our collection costs. Collection costs may include court costs, reasonable attorneys� fees 
and fees for repossession, repair, storage and sale of any vehicle securing a purchase. We will charge these costs only if the attorney we ask to collect is not our salaried employee and 
the law allows us to do so. 

24. DISPUTE AND CLAIM RESOLUTION (INCLUDING ARBITRATION) PROVISION. 
General/Requirement to Arbitrate. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION 
WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A 
COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS 
INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED. This Provision replaces any existing arbitration provision with us and will stay in force no matter 
what happens to your account, including termination. Upon demand, and except as otherwise provided below, you and we must arbitrate individually any dispute or claim between you, any joint cardholder and/or any additional cardholder, 
on the one hand; and us, our affiliates, agents and/or dealers/merchants/retailers or participating professionals, on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises from or relates to your 
account. However, we will not require you to arbitrate: (1) any individual case in small claims court or your state�s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court; or 
(2) any claim by us that only involves our effort to collect money you owe us. However, if you respond to a collection lawsuit by claiming that we engaged in any wrongdoing, we may 
require you to arbitrate. 

YOU AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. ALSO, YOU 
MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ON BEHALF OF ANY CARDHOLDER WHO IS NOT A JOINT OR ADDITIONAL CARDHOLDER WITH YOU ON YOUR ACCOUNT (AN 
�UNRELATED CARDHOLDER�), AND YOU AGREE THAT NO UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY BRING ANY CLAIMS AGAINST US ON YOUR BEHALF. CLAIMS BY YOU AND 
BY AN UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY NOT BE JOINED IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. Only a court may decide whether any part of this paragraph is enforceable. If it is finally 
determined that this paragraph is not fully enforceable, only this sentence of the Provision will remain in force and the remainder of the Provision will be null and void, provided that the 
court�s determination concerning the enforceability of this paragraph shall be subject to appeal. 

Starting an Arbitration. If you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, the electing party must notify the other party in writing. This notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit and can be 
given in papers filed in the lawsuit. Otherwise,",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

to take Cash Advances as described in this Agreement. You agree not to use your Card for any 
unlawful purpose. If you use, or allow someone else to use, any Card associated with your Account 
for any other purpose, you will be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us and 
MasterCard� International Incorporated (�MasterCard�) for all amounts or expenses either Banco 
Popular North America or MasterCard pays as a result of such use. 

 

(ii) PROMISE TO PAY 

You promise to pay for (a) credit extended by Banco Popular North America, to you or to anyone 
whom you permit to use any Card associated with your Account; (b) INTEREST CHARGES, late 
charges, and any other fees or administrative charges (e.g., returned check charges) provided in this 
Agreement; and (c) collection costs and attorneys' fees as permitted by applicable law if your Account 
should go into default. 

 

(iii) CASH ADVANCES 

The term �Cash Advance� includes the following transactions: (1) Automated Teller Machine (ATM) 
transactions; (2) convenience check transactions; (3) money orders, cashiers checks, travelers 
checks, wire transfers, foreign currency or other in-bank transactions; (4) tax payments; (5) certain 
permitted gambling transactions; and (6) court costs, bail bonds and fines. Convenience checks are 
used the same as personal checks and are drawn from your Account and billed on your monthly 
Account Statement. 

 

(iv) CREDIT LIMIT 

You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases 
and Cash Advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon 
receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each Account 
Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit 
limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you 
exceed your authorized credit limit, the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return 
or forfeit the Card and close the Account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, 
shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized 
credit limit. 

 

(v) INTEREST CHARGES 

Monthly INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on all balances on this Account. The INTEREST 
CHARGE applied to purchases and balance transfers from other institutions will be based on variable 
Annual Percentage Rates (�APR�). This APR can increase or decrease for each billing period. Different 
APRs can apply to purchases, Cash Advances, balance transfers from other institutions, and 
convenience checks. Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for specific APRs related to your 
Account. 

Variable APRs will be determined by adding the United States Prime Rate as published in The Wall 
Street Journal (�Prime Rate�) to a margin. There is no pre-set limit on rate increases. The amount of 
your margins and current APRs are disclosed in the accompanying card mailer. We determine the 
margins applicable to your Account based on your credit history at the time of approval of your Card 
application. An increase in the Prime Rate will cause an increase in your APR, the INTEREST CHARGE 
and your minimum payment. 

The �Daily Periodic Rate� is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances and is determined 
by dividing the APR by 365 and rounding up. For each billing period, the APR will be based on the 
Prime Rate published two business days prior to the Account Statement/closing date for that billing 
period. In the event the Prime Rate is not available as of that date, we may substitute a similar 
published rate that is outside of our control. To the extent permitted by law, any change in your APR 
will apply to the existing balance on your Account and to new transactions. 

The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances. The INTEREST 
CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the 
number of days in the billing period. 

The Average Daily Balance for purchases is obtained by taking into account the initial daily balance on 
purchases, plus any new purchases, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on purchases, and any 
other fees and charges that we add that day, minus any payments and credits we apply to the 
purchase balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the 
total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. New purchases are added to the daily 
balance on posting date, unless we elect to use a later date. Purchases will begin to accrue INTEREST 
CHARGES on the date of posting. No INTEREST CHARGE will be imposed on a purchase added to your 
daily balance during the billing cycle covered by the Account Statement if that Account Statement 
shows no previous balance or shows that the previous balance was paid in full by its payment due 
date. Also, no additional INTEREST CHARGE will be charged on any purchases included in the new 
balance of a monthly Account Statement if you pay the new balance in full on or before the date 
specified in your Account Statement. The payment due date will be 25 days or more, depending upon 
the payment due date on your Account. 

The Average Daily Balance for Cash Advances is obtained by taking into account the initial daily 
balance on Cash Advances, plus any new Cash Advances, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on 
Cash Advances, and any other Cash Advance fees that we add that day, minus any payments and 
credits we apply to the Cash Advance balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing 
period are added and the total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. The INTEREST 


CHARGE on Cash Advances, balance transfers and convenience checks will be imposed from the date 
the transaction is conducted. There is no �free ride� period for such transactions. 

Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for other terms which are made a part of this 
Agreement. 

 

(vi) ANNUAL FEE 

If applicable, the annual fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is 
issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the first Card. Please refer to the 
accompanying card mailer for specific annual fee information related to your Account. 

 

(vii) MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 

We will not impose any late charges or penalty fees if you pay at least the minimum payment 
reflected on your Account Statement by the specified �Payment Due� date. If you wish, you may pay 
more than the minimum payment and at any time you may pay the entire amount due for the current 
billing cycle. Send payments to Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 
2938, Milwaukee, WI 53201-2938. 

 

Your payment will be credited as of the day we receive it, subject to any applicable cutoff hour. The 
new cutoff time for payments received by mail, telephone and other electronic means is 5:00 p.m. 
Central Time. We offer the convenience of online payments. Please visit www.mypopularcards.com to 
set up an account and avail of this free online payment service. Payments received by 5:00 pm CST, 
Monday through Friday, will be processed the same day. Online payments received on Saturday, 
Sunday or a Bank holiday will be processed the next business day. If the payment is made at a Bank 
branch during business hours in cash or with a check drawn against the Bank, it will be processed the 
same day. Credit for any other payments may be delayed five (5) business days during which interest 
will not accrue. If your payment due date falls on a weekend or legal federal holiday, the payment 
received will be credited to the account on the next business day and will not be considered late. If your 
payment is received after the payment cutoff time on the due date or any time thereafter, a late 
payment fee will be charged to your Account. Please refer to the back of your card mailer for more 
details regarding the minimum monthly payment and other important terms applicable to your Account. 

 

(viii) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS 

If you pay the required minimum payment of the monthly Account Statement, the payment shall be 
applied in the following way: first to INTEREST CHARGES and the rest shall be applied first to the 
debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances, with the lowest APR and then to the debt with the 
higher APR in ascending order. Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until 
the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required 
payment, the excess shall be applied first to the debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances 
with the highest APR and then to the debt with the lowest APR in descending order. 

 

All payments by mail must be made by check or money order. Payments may not be made by 
attempting to effect a transfer or by using a convenience check from this Account or from any other 
Banco Popular North America credit card account. You agree that any payment you make may be, 
but is not required to be, returned to you without applying it to your Account and without 
presentment or protest, for reasons including, but not limited to, that the check or money order: (1) 
is missing a signature; (2) is drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (3) contains a 
restrictive endorsement; (4) is post dated; (5) is not payable to Banco Popular North America; (6) is 
not payable in U.S. dollars; (7) is not paid upon presentment; or (8) results from an attempted 
transfer or is drawn on a convenience check. You agree to pay any Bank collection fees we incur for 
any check payments made in U.S. dollars drawn on a financial institution not located in the United 
States. All payments made by mail under this Agreement must be received at the address specified 
on your Account Statement. 

 

Any conditional check, money order or any other instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a 
disputed debt or as an accord and satisfaction or containing a restrictive endorsement must be sent 
to us at the Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 2938, Milwaukee, 
WI 53201-2938. You must note conspicuously on the face of the payment that it is tendered for this 
purpose. If you make a payment in any other manner and we accept it, we will not have waived our 
rights to collect any amounts owed under this Agreement. Even though your payment may be posted 
to your Account, we may not restore your available credit or Cash Advance available credit 
immediately. 

 

(ix) MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENT 

The Bank shall mail to you a monthly Account Statement at the end of each billing period in which 
you have a balance in excess of $1. You must notify the Bank, in writing, of any error in the Account 
Statement, within sixty (60) days, following the date on which the Account Statement was mailed. 

 

(x) FEES 

Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

a. Penalty fee: A late fee will be added to the standard purchase balance for each billing period you 
fail to pay by its due date the minimum payment due. Returned payment fees may also be charged. 

 

b. Currency conversion fee: If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, other than a cash 
advance made at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, MasterCard will convert the charge into a U.S. 
dollar amount. MasterCard currently uses a conversion rate in effect one day prior to its transaction 
processing date. Such rate is either a wholesale market rate or the government-mandated rate. 
Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

 


If you make a Cash Advance in a foreign currency at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, the 
amount is converted into U.S. dollars by our affiliate in accordance with its foreign currency 
conversion procedures then in effect. Our affiliate currently uses a conversion rate in effect on its 
applicable processing date. Such rate is either a mid-point market rate or the government-mandated 
rate. 

 

The foreign currency conversion rate in effect on the applicable processing date for a transaction may 
differ from the rate in effect on the sale or post date on your Account Statement for that transaction. 

 

If a transaction is converted by a third party prior to such transaction being processed by MasterCard, 
the foreign currency conversion rate for that transaction will be the rate selected by that third party. 

 

c. Administrative charges: We may charge you a fee to take advantage of certain optional 
administrative services we provide our Cardmembers such as copy of Account Statements, additional 
credit cards or express delivery services. Each time an administrative service is offered to you, any 
fee for the service will be reflected on your Account Statement. You agree to pay the fee disclosed 
each time you opt to take advantage of an administrative service. These services are optional and are 
not required to be used by you. 

 

(xi) DEFAULT AND TERMINATION OF CREDIT PRIVILEGES

conditions of this Agreement; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit

your moving out of the U.S. After your default, your Account balance will continue to accrue 
INTEREST CHARGES at the contract rate. Balances outstanding under this Agreement when your 
credit line is reduced or terminated will continue to accrue INTEREST CHARGES until paid in full and 
subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. Upon default, we have the right to terminate or 
suspend your credit privileges under this Agreement, to change the terms of your Account and this 
Agreement, may require you to pay your entire Account balance including all accrued but unpaid 
charges immediately as permitted by law and to sue you for what you owe. You will pay our court, 
reasonable attorney's fees and other collection costs related to the default to the extent permitted by 
applicable law. Upon default, we will apply your payments first to attorneys' fees and then in the 
order set forth under Application of Payments. We may continue to impose INTEREST CHARGES after 
default (including charge-off). 

 

(xii) CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS 

Some transactions will require our prior authorization and you may be asked to provide identification. 
If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you 
have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not 
responsible for any refusal to accept or honor your Card. We can cancel your Account, refuse to allow 
further transactions, or revoke your Card at any time.

unauthorized use of your Card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify 
us of the loss, theft or possible unauthorized use. Notification must be given by you immediately

In any case, your liability for unauthorized use of your Card will not exceed $50. However, 
unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given the Card or authority to 
use your Account and you will be liable for all use by such a user. To terminate this authority, you 
must retrieve the Card or Cards from the previously authorized user and return it to us at the 
aforementioned address along with a letter explaining why you are doing so.

accrue interest and other charges and be subject to this Agreement. We will not honor any transfer or 
convenience check written on your Account if we receive the check after your Account is cancelled. 

 

(xviii) APPLICABLE LAW 

This Agreement will be governed by the laws of Florida (without regard to its conflict of laws 
principles), whether or not you live in Florida, and whether or not your Account is used outside of 
Florida, and by any applicable federal laws. You agree that: (1) this Agreement is entered into in 
Florida; (2) all credit under this Agreement will be extended from Florida; and (3) all credit extended 
under this Agreement is subject to, and governed by, Florida law. All terms and conditions of this 
Agreement (including the Amendment provision or any other provision herein relating to a change in 
the terms of this Agreement, this Applicable Law provision, and any of the Interest Charge, 
Application of Payment and Fee provisions) are deemed to be material to a determination of the 
INTEREST CHARGE.

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS: Keep this Document for Future Use 

 

This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing 
Act. 

 

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Account Statement 

If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, write to us at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

In your letter, give us the following information: 

� Account information: Your name and account number. 
� Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
� Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, describe what 
you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. 


 

You must contact us: 

� Within 60 days after the error appeared on your Account Statement. 
� At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment 
on the amount you think is wrong. 


 

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not 
required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 

 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 

When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 

1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also 
tell you if we have already corrected the error. 

2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we 
believe the Account Statement is correct. 

 

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 

� We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
� The charge in question may remain on your Account Statement, and we may continue to impose 
INTEREST CHARGES on that amount. 
� While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your 
balance. 
� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 


 

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 

� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any INTEREST CHARGES 
or other fees related to that amount. 



� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with 
applicable INTEREST CHARGES and fees. We will send you an Account Statement of the amount 
you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the 
amount we think you owe. 


 

If you receive our explanation but still believe your Account Statement is wrong, you must write to us 
within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent 
without also reporting that you are questioning your Account Statement. We must tell you the name 
of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when 
the matter has been settled between us. 

 

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you 
question even if your Account Statement is correct. 

 

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Card Purchases 

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your Card and you 
have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay 
the remaining amount due on the purchase. 

 

To use this right, all of the following must be true: 

1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing 
address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. 

(Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to 
you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 

2. You must have used your Card for the purchase. Purchases made with Cash Advances from an 
ATM or with a check that accesses your Account do not qualify. 

3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 

 

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in 
writing at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we 
finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount 
and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
1. GENERAL: Each person signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application for a credit card account (“Account”) as applicant or joint applicant applies for an Account with HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., a national banking association, and requests one or more credit card(s) bearing the name or tradename of the merchant to be used in connection with the Account. The word “Card” means any credit card(s) issued to you or an authorized user of your Account. In this Agreement, the words “you” and “your” refer to the applicant and joint applicant named on the credit card application and the words “we”, “us” and “our” refer to HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., located at 1111 Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144.
If your application is approved, “applicant” will be referred to as “primary cardholder” and “joint applicant” will be referred to as “secondary cardholder” for purposes of this agreement.
If we accept your application to open an Account, you agree that you will only purchase goods and services for personal, family and household purposes from merchants which honor the Card.
2. ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT: By a) signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application, using or permitting others to use the Card, b) signing or permitting others to sign sales slips; or c) making or permitting others to make purchases by telephone, Internet, or any other means, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Cardholder Agreement and Disclosure Statement, which includes an arbitration provision.
3. PROMISE TO PAY: You agree to pay all amounts charged to the Account, whether incurred by you or anyone you authorize or permit to use your Account or Card. If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.
4. ABILITY TO REPAY: When you use the Account or permit others to use the Account, you represent that you have the ability and intention to repay all amounts charged to the Account.
5. BILLING STATEMENT: We will send you a billing statement monthly for each billing cycle at the end of which you have a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00, or in which an Interest Charge has been imposed. The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other charges or fees, including credit insurance or debt cancellation (if applicable), and all payments and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle. The billing statement will show the amount owed on your Account. The total Amount owed is called “New Balance” on your billing statement subject to the terms of Promotional Credit Plan purchases, if any, as indicated below.
6. PROMOTIONAL CREDIT PLANS: The following Promotional Credit Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase: a) Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan – no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase for a specified period, as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; b) Same As Cash/Monthly Payment Credit Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase before the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, Interest Charges will be imposed from the purchase date; c) Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; d) Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan – A special repayment factor will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; e) Special Repayment Factor/Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A special repayment factor and a reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle.  All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Credit Plan are referred to as Regular Credit Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Card. Call 1-888-367-4310 or review the Application of Payments section of this Agreement for information.
7. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(iv) a purchase on a Same As Cash Credit Plan if the full cash sales price is paid in full before the promotion expiration date.
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan other than a Same As Cash Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Same As Cash Credit Plan during a cycle, the amount will be the sum of the following daily Interest Charge calculations for the Credit Plan during the current cycle and during each of the prior billing cycles (each a “Prior Cycle”) from the transaction date of the purchase through the current cycle: (i) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for the Current Cycle times the Daily Balance for each day in the current cycle; and (ii) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for each Prior Cycle times the Daily Balances of the Credit Plan for each day during each Prior Cycle.
(e) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) incurred on that day and 4) any late fees, over the credit limit fees, returned payment fees or other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. For any Same As Cash Credit Plan, credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) are not included in the Daily Balance of that Credit Plan during the promotional period. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(f) The Daily Periodic Rate for the Standard Rate will be .06274% (corresponding 22.9% Annual Percentage Rate). The Daily Periodic Rate for the Penalty Rate will be .07370% (corresponding 26.9% Annual Percentage Rate). Your APR may increase to the Penalty APR if we fail to receive your minimum payment with in 60 days when due. You will no longer be eligible for the Standard Rate and all existing Promotional Credit Plans will terminate, and your entire Account balance will be subject to the Penalty Rate. If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the new Penalty APR goes into effect. If you make the next six consecutive on time minimum payments starting with your first payment due once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APR(s) applicable to your Account.  If you do not make these six consecutive on time minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.
8. MINIMUM Interest CHARGE: A minimum Interest Charge of $2.00 will be assessed for each billing cycle in which an Interest Charge is payable.
9. FEES: We may impose on your Account the following fees, which will be added to your Account when assessed:
a)	Late Payment Fee: A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
	The amount of the Late Payment Fee is shown in the chart below.  In no event will your Late Payment Fee exceed the amount of your Minimum Payment Due.

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - Up to and including $100
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $19
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $19

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $100 and up to and including $500

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $500
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25

b)	Returned Payment Fee: A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
	Your Returned Payment Fee is $25.
	In no event will your Returned Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
c)	Research Fees: A Research Fee may be assessed to the Account for each copy of a requested document. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such copies are requested.
d)	Reissued Card Fee: You may be charged $5 each time you request that your credit card be reissued.
e)	Payment by Phone Fee: A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment is requested.
f)	Over the Credit Limit Fee: In the event you exceed your credit limit, you will be charged an Over the Credit Limit Fee of $0.
g)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
10. INSURANCE: If available and you elect any credit insurance coverage, you authorize us to charge the insurance premium for such insurance to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the insurance premium is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the premium is being assessed. Credit insurance charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
11. DEBT CANCELLATION: If available and you elect debt cancellation, you authorize us to charge the fee for such debt cancellation to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the debt cancellation fee is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the fee is being assessed. Debt cancellation charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
12. MINIMUM PAYMENT: You agree to pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due. Your Minimum Payment due is equal to your Minimum Payment plus the Special Repayment Factor for any Promotional Credit Plans with a special repayment factor plus any debt cancellation fees or credit insurance premiums attributable to any Reduced Rate/Special Repayment Factor Credit plans plus any delinquent amounts. The Minimum Payment is the greater of a.) $25 or b.) 1% of your “New Balance” (which does not include balances on Special Repayment Factor Credit Plans) plus billed Interest Charges plus any Late Fees assessed for that month, rounded to the next highest dollar. Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments, which may affect crediting of your payments.
13. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) not drawn in U.S. dollars on funds on deposit in the U.S.; (b) missing a signature; (c) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (d) restrictively endorsed; (e) postdated; (f) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (g) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to HSBC Retail Services, P.O. Box 5226, Carol Stream, IL 60197-5226. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
14. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances. If you have a Same As Cash Credit Plan(s), we will automatically apply payments received during the final two complete billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first to the required Minimum Payment Due and next to the plan(s) that is expiring, in the order of expiration; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0% APR for purposes of determining payment application.
15. CREDIT LIMIT: You agree not to let the Account balance exceed the credit limit established for you by us from time to time. We do not have to honor any use of your Card or honor credit card checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit, but if we do, you agree to repay the amount by which your credit limit is exceeded, plus Interest Charges immediately.
16. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of any merchant to accept or honor the Card or a credit card check.
17. SECURITY: Except as indicated below, you grant us a purchase money security interest in the goods purchased with your Card and in all insurance contracts and all proceeds, returned premiums, mechanical failure and extended service contracts, and refunds of charges for mechanical failure and extended service contracts financed therewith. Each good purchased on your Account will secure the entire Account balance until such good is paid in full. For purposes of determining which goods are subject to a security interest, payments received will be deemed to be applied first to any unpaid insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable), Interest Charges and fees and then to pay for purchases on the Account in the order in which they were made. When sufficient payments are made to repay the portion of the Account balance attributable to the purchase of a particular good, we will release our purchase money security interest in that good. Goods covered by a security interest may be taken from you if you do not pay on time. We may require you to make them available at a convenient place of our choice. We take no security interest in goods where the original purchase price is less than $200 if you live in New York and in goods where the original purchase price is less than $700 if you live in Maryland. If we repossess any goods purchased with your Card, we may charge you our repossession cost including, but not limited to, necessary repairs, storage fees and costs of sale, when and as permitted by law.
18. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Total Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your moving out of the U.S. or Canada or providing us with a non-U.S. or non-Canadian mailing address; (l) your becoming incompetent; (m) your exceeding your credit limit; (n) your payment being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (o) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (p) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.
19. ARBITRATION: 
Federal Arbitration Act
This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1 - 16 (the ""FAA""). The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and provide written reasoned findings of fact and conclusions of law upon written request as set forth in the applicable arbitration association procedures. The arbitrator's award shall not be subject to appeal except as permitted by the FAA. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Claims and Arbitration Administrators
This arbitration provision shall apply to any Claim (defined below) by or against us, or you or any other Covered Person (defined below). You agree any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether based upon contract; tort, intentional or otherwise; constitution; statute; common law; or equity and whether preexisting, present or future), including initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third party claims, arising from or relating to (a) this Agreement, the application, your Account, any transaction or activity involving any payment or failure to make payment on your Account, or any solicitation, advertisement, promotion, or oral or written statements related to this Agreement or your Account, (b) the relationships which result from this Agreement and your relationship with any Covered Person pursuant to the criteria in the immediately preceding subsection or (c) the scope, validity or enforceability of this arbitration clause, any part thereof or the entire Agreement (any of the forgoing a ""Claim""), shall be resolved, upon the election of you, us, or any other Covered Person described below, by binding arbitration pursuant to this arbitration provision and the applicable rules or procedures of the arbitration administrator (the “Administrator”) selected at the time the Claim is filed or received by a party to the Claim. The party initiating the arbitration proceeding shall have the right to select one of the following Administrators: Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) or the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). The arbitrator shall be a lawyer with more than ten years experience or a retired or former judge. The rules and forms of JAMS and AAA may be obtained by writing to these organizations at the addresses listed under Further Information below. Our address for service of process under this provision is HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., P.O. Box 98740, Las Vegas, NV 89193-8740.
Small Claims Exemption
We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim you may bring in small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration at such time.
Location of Arbitration and Fees
Any participatory arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient to you. On any Claim you file, you will pay the first $50 of the filing fee. At your request we will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the Administrator on any Claim submitted by you in arbitration up to a maximum of $1,500. If you are required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, we will consider a request by you to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, we shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees unless the arbitrator grants you an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in your favor, we will reimburse you for any additional fees paid or owed by you to the Administrator up to the amount of the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual award in your favor. The parties shall bear the expense of their respective attorney's fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, or the fees paid to the Administrator, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein. If the arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the Administrator or for which we are responsible.
Covered Persons
This arbitration provision covers Claims by or against (a) us, any corporate parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, any predecessor or successor of the foregoing, and any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of any of the aforementioned, (b) you and any authorized user, and any other person claiming through you or any authorized user, and (c) any other person assisting us in offering Cards, administering Accounts or providing Card related benefits or services (“Covered Persons”). If a Claim that is within the scope of the first paragraph of the “Claims and Arbitration Administrators” paragraph above is advanced by or against any third person, and any of the persons mentioned in the previous sentence is involved as a party, then the entire Claim is subject to arbitration under this Agreement, including any Claim by or against any third person.
Protection of Information
The rules and procedures of the Administrator, which you may obtain from that organization, shall govern the arbitration unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will control. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, nor to state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. If you or we request, the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized under applicable law and will use best efforts to protect confidential information (including through use of protective orders).
Parties to Arbitration
Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.” The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver. You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules. In the event of such an appeal, an appeal panel consisting of three arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The panel's decision will be final and binding. Any final decision of the arbitrator or of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as provided under the FAA. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the FAA by any court having jurisdiction.
Consequences of Electing Arbitration
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY EITHER PARTY.

     M. ""Payment Due Date"" has the meaning described in paragraph 5.
     N. ""PIN"" means the Personal Identification Number which may be assigned to your Credit Account.
     O. ""Posting Date"" means the date that the charge was debited or credited to your Account.
     P. ""Purchase"" means credit you or an Authorized User obtain on the Account when the Card or Account number is presented
          to a merchant to purchase goods or services.
     Q. ""Statement"" means a statement of your Account which we send at the end of any Billing Cycle in which we owe you or you
          owe us more than $1.00, or any charge, payment, credit, Cash Advance or Purchase to your Account has occurred.
     R. ""Transaction Date"" means the date the goods or services were purchased or the date the Cash Advance was made.
 2. Your Responsibility for the Account: You are responsible for all amounts owed on your Account, whether it is used by you or
     by an Authorized User, and you agree to pay such amounts according to the terms of this Contract. We expect that you will retain
     control over the Card and its use, not allowing any other person to use the Card. In the event you allow another person to use
     the Card, you will be liable to us for such usage. We extend purchase credit to you on your Account when we pay the merchant
     on your behalf for the transaction.
          At your request, we may issue an additional Card with your Account number in the name of an Authorized User. You agree
     to be obligated for all purchases, cash advances, interest and other fees resulting from the Authorized User's use of the Account.
     The Authorized User will also be responsible for all purchases, cash advances, interest and other fees resulting from their use of
     the Account, but we are not required to seek recovery from the Authorized User before requiring payment from you. If you decide
     to terminate an Authorized User's use of the Account, we must receive written notice from you, together with the return of the
     Card issued to the Authorized User (cut in half). You remain responsible for all charge activity made until we receive notification.
          Each person receiving a Card agrees to sign the Card. Cards are not transferable and should not be given to anyone else to
      use. Additional people who desire an account should apply for their own account. You may apply for an additional Card
      for Authorized Users. The Cards are issued by us and you agree to surrender the Cards to us upon our demand. You
      also agree to notify us immediately if the Card is lost or stolen or you suspect unauthorized use of the Card.
            You promise to pay us all sums you owe on your Credit Account, along with our Interest and other charges, in
      accordance with this Contract.
3.    Using your Account to Obtain Credit: We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit the use, amount, frequency,
      or number of transactions you can make on the Card, including limiting your use of the Card at ATMs. You can use the
      Card and your Account to make Purchases and obtain Cash Advances as long as you do not exceed your Credit Limit
      and your Account is not closed, suspended, or exceeds authorization limits. When you receive your Card, you may be
      assigned a PIN. If a PIN is assigned to you, you can obtain a Cash Advance at any authorized ATM by using the Card
      and PIN. A Cash Advance must be greater or equal to $20.00 to be approved. Your Card cannot be used for illegal
      transactions.
4.    Your Credit Limit: Your Credit Limit appears on the Card Carrier and on your Statements. You may not exceed your
      Credit Limit at any time. However, if we choose to permit you to obtain additional credit, we may require that you pay us
      any amount over your Credit Limit immediately upon demand rather than in monthly installments and we may suspend
      your Account privileges or cancel your Account as described in Paragraph 26.
5.    Monthly Billing Statements: We will send you a monthly Statement at the end of each billing period. The Statements
      will reflect the account activity and our charges during the Billing Cycle. They will also show your Minimum Payment
      and the Payment Due Date, which is the date we must receive at least the Minimum Payment. If there are more than
      one of you living at different addresses, we will send the Statements only to the person named as the ""Applicant"" on the
      application.
6.    Payments: Payments will be credited as of the date of receipt if they are received at the address on the payment stub.
      We may accept late payments or partial payments or checks and money orders marked ""payment in full"" or similar
      language, without losing any of our rights under this Contract to receive payment in full. Payments should not be made
      by postdated check. If we receive payment by postdated check, we may deposit it and shall have no liability if it is posted
      prior to the date that appears on the check. We reserve the right to limit available credit resulting from any payment for
      up to thirty (30) days. However, for security purposes, we may hold a payment longer. By sending your check, please
      be aware that you are authorizing us to use the information on your check to make a one-time electronic debit from your
      account at the financial institution indicated on your check. This electronic debit will be for the amount of your check;
      no additional amount will be added to the amount. Please contact the Customer Service Department at the telephone
      number on your Statement to learn about other payment options if you prefer to not have your check used in this way.
      In the event that your check is returned unpaid for insufficient or uncollected funds, we may represent your check
      electronically. In the ordinary course of business, your check will not be provided to you with your bank statement, but a
      copy can be retrieved by contacting your financial institution.
7.    Minimum Payment: You may pay your entire balance at any time, without penalty. Whenever a balance is due, you
      must pay us at least the Minimum Payment each month. The Minimum Payment is the sum of (i) the Monthly Payment
      plus (ii) all past due Monthly Payment amounts plus (iii) any amount your Account exceeds the Credit Limit. The Monthly
      Payment is the greater of: $30.00; 4% of your balance or Current Cycle's Interest, Late Payment Fee, and 1% of the
      balance. If your New Balance is less than the Minimum Payment, the New Balance is due in full. We must receive your
      payment on or before the Payment Due Date shown on the Statement. The Payment Due Date will be twenty-five (25)
      days from the Closing Date.
8.    Applying your Payments: In general, the payment will be applied in the following order: Unpaid Interest, Unpaid Fees
      and other Charges; and then principal balance. Payments applied to the principal balance will first be paid to balances
      at the highest Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and then to balances at lower APR's.
9.    Payment Methods: All payments must be made in U.S. dollars and drawn on a financial institution located in the United
      States. Payments should be made payable to First National Visa Credit Card. Do not send cash through the mail.
      Payments made through the mail in the form of cash or third-party checks may not be accepted.
10.   When Interest is Imposed: Interest will be imposed on Purchases only if you elect not to pay the entire New Balance
      shown on your Statement by the Payment Due Date. For Cash Advances, Interest is imposed from the date the Cash
      Advance is made until it is paid in full and there is no grace period in which you may repay a Cash Advance to avoid
      Interest.
11.   Average Daily Balance: We start with the Previous Balance and add purchases and cash advances as of their post
      dates and fees and charges as of the transaction dates. We subtract payments and credits as of their post dates. Then
      we add the daily balances and divide by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. To calculate the interest, we multiply
      the Average Daily Balance by the Monthly Periodic Rate. The Monthly Periodic Rate is calculated by dividing the Annual
      Percentage Rate disclosed in the ""Interest Rates and Interest Charges"" table in this Contract by 12 (months). In any
      Billing Cycle when you are subject to Interest and the Interest as computed above is less than the minimum Interest as
      indicated in the ""Interest Rates and Interest Charges"" table on the back of the application, you will be billed the minimum
      Interest.
12.   Account Fees: Please see the ""Fees"" table on the back of the application for the amounts of charges applicable to your
      Account. Your account terms may or may not include all charges listed below. You agree to pay us the following other
      Fees, each of which will be billed to your Account as a Purchase and will accrue Interest:
      a. Annual Fee: We may impose an Annual Fee on your Credit Account. The Annual Fee will be charged on the first
           Billing Cycle and in about the same Billing Cycle of each following year.
      b. Cash Advance Fee: We charge a Cash Advance Fee for each Cash Advance taken on your Account through either
           an ATM, bank withdrawal or other means provided.
      c. Late Payment Fee: In every billing period in which your payment is not received by the payment due date, you will
           be charged a Late Payment Fee.
      d. Returned Payment Fee: If any check or other payment instrument is not honored for any reason by the institution on
           which it was drawn, we will impose a Returned Payment Fee.
      e. Authorized User Fee: We will charge a one-time fee if you request an Authorized User on your account.
13.   Other Fees: You agree to pay us the following other Fees, each of which will be billed to your Account as a Purchase
      and will accrue Interest:
      a. Express Delivery Fee: We will charge a $25.00 fee for the express delivery of your Card sent priority two (2) day
           courier.
      b. Expedited Payment Fee: We will charge a $9.00 fee if you speak with a service representative and request that we
           expedite your payment by withdrawing funds from your checking or savings account to make a payment on your
           Account. We will process your request and post an Expedited Payment Fee to your Account.
    c.   Additional Card Fee: If you authorize us to issue additional Cards on the Credit Account for you or for other Authorized
         Users, there is an Additional Card Fee imposed annually.
    d. Copying Fee: We will charge a one-time $5.00 per item fee if you request a duplicate of any sales draft, statement
         or other document. We will charge you for each copy we provide.
    e. Due Date Change Fee: We will charge $10.00 if you request a change in your payment due date.
    f. Replacement Card Fee: We will charge $5.00 to replace your credit card.
14. Lost or Stolen Cards: If your Card is lost or stolen, or if you believe that it is being used without your permission, you
     must notify us at (888) 883-9824, which is available 24 hours a day. You should also follow up in writing. You should not
     use the Account or Card after you have notified us. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you
     notify us of the loss, theft or possible unauthorized use.
15. ARBITRATION: PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. YOU AGREE THAT ANY
     DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO
     COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR
     PROCEEDING. IN ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR
     JURY. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN COURT PROCEDURES. YOU
     ALSO AGREE ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE LIMITED TO THE DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US AND WILL NOT
     BE PART OF A CLASS-WIDE OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.
    a. Agreement to Arbitrate: You and we agree that any Dispute will be resolved by Arbitration. This agreement is
         governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 USCS � 1 et seq. and the substantive law of the State of South
         Dakota.
    b. Definitions: Arbitration is a means of having an independent third party resolve a Dispute. A ""Dispute"" is any controversy
         or claim between you and us. The term Dispute is to be given its broadest possible meaning and includes, without
         limitation, all claims or demands (whether past, present or future, including events that occurred prior to the opening
         of this Account), based on any legal or equitable theory (tort, contract or otherwise), and regardless of the type of
         relief sought (i.e. money, injunctive relief or declaratory relief). A Dispute includes, by way of example and without
         limitation, any claim based upon federal or state constitution, statute, ordinance, regulation, or common law, and
         any issue concerning the validity, enforceability or scope of this arbitration agreement. The term ""you"" includes any
         cosigner, co-obligor, guarantor, joint user or Authorized User and also your heirs, guardian, personal representative
         or trustee in bankruptcy. The term ""us"" includes our employees, officers, directors, attorneys, affiliated companies,
         predecessors and assigns, as well as our marketing, servicing and collection representatives and agents.
    c. Selection of Arbitrator. If a Dispute arises, the party asserting the claim or defense must initiate arbitration, provided
         you or we may first try to resolve the matter informally or through customary business methods, including collection
         activity. The party filing an arbitration may initiate and pursue the matter with the American Arbitration Association
         (""AAA"") or we may agree upon a different arbitrator described below. If you claim you have a Dispute with us, but do
         not initiate an arbitration or select an arbitrator, we may do so. You may obtain copies of the current rules of AAA and
         forms and instructions for initiating an arbitration by contacting them as follows:
                American Arbitration Association
                335 Madison Avenue, Floor 10
                New York, NY 10017-4605
                Website: www.adr.org
         The policies and procedures of the arbitrator will apply provided that they are consistent with this arbitration agreement.
         To the extent the arbitrator's rules or procedures are different than the terms of this arbitration agreement, the terms
         of this agreement shall apply. If the AAA is not available to adjudicate the matter, or if the AAA is not convenient
         or acceptable to you, you and we may agree on one or more neutral arbitrators. If you and we cannot agree on
         arbitrator(s), an arbitrator will be appointed by a court with jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to the FAA.
    d.   Cost of Arbitration: We will pay the filing fee and any costs or fees charged by the arbitrator regardless of whether
         you or we initiate the arbitration. Except where otherwise provided by applicable law, each party will be responsible
         for its own attorneys' fees and other expenses. Unless prohibited by law, the arbitrator may award fees, costs and
         reasonable attorneys' fees to the party who substantially prevails in the arbitration.
    e.   Place of Arbitration: Unless you and we agree to a different location, the arbitration will be held in the same city as
         the U.S. District Court closest to your then-current mailing address. The arbitrator may decide the matter based upon
         written submissions by the parties if permitted under the arbitration rules.
    f.   Waiver of Rights: You are waiving your right to a jury trial, to have a court decide your Dispute, to participate in a
         class action lawsuit and to certain discovery and other procedures that are available in a lawsuit. The arbitrator has
         the ability to award all remedies available by statute, at law or in equity to the prevailing party. You and we agree
         that the arbitrator has no authority to conduct class-wide proceedings and will be restricted to resolving the individual
         disputes between you and us. If an arbitration firm or arbitrator fails or refuses to enforce the waiver of class-wide
         arbitration, then the Dispute will proceed in court. The validity, effect and enforceability of this waiver of class action
         lawsuit and class-wide arbitration is to be determined solely by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by the
         arbitration firm or arbitrator. If such court refuses to enforce the class-wide arbitration waiver, then it is agreed the
         Dispute will proceed in court rather than arbitration.
    g.   Review of Arbitration Award. The arbitrator shall apply applicable federal and South Dakota substantive law and the
         terms of your agreements with us. The arbitrator shall make written findings and the arbitrator's award may be filed
         with any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration award shall be supported by substantial evidence and must be
         consistent with your agreements with us and applicable law or may be set aside by a court upon judicial review.
    h.   Other Provisions: If any portion of this arbitration agreement is subsequently deemed unenforceable, the enforceability
         of any other provision of this agreement shall not be affected and the unenforceable term shall be amended such
         that it is enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law provided that if a class action litigation or a class-wide
         arbitration is permitted for any reason, either party may require that the entire Dispute be heard by a Judge, sitting
         without a jury, under applicable court rules and procedures. This arbitration provision shall survive: (i) termination or
         changes in your agreements with us, the Account, or the relationship between you and us concerning the Account;
         (ii) the bankruptcy of any party; and (iii) any transfer, sale or assignment of the Account, or any amounts owed on the
         Account, to any other person or entity.
    i.   Right to Opt-Out: If you do not wish to agree to arbitrate all Disputes with us, you must advise us in writing at the
         following address within thirty (30) days of our mailing this agreement to you at the most recent mailing address we
         have for you: First National Credit Card, PO Box 5097, Sioux Falls, SD 57117-5097.
16. If Your Card is Refused: We are not responsible, and have no liability, if a merchant, a financial institution, an ATM or
    any third party refuses to honor your Card or accept a transaction on your Account. Although you may have the credit
    available, we may be unable to authorize credit due to operational difficulties or mistakes. The number of transactions
    you make, or transactions above a certain dollar amount, may require authorization before the transaction is approved.
    Neither we nor our agents will be responsible or have any liability if authorization for a transaction is not given. If your
    Account is over limit or delinquent, authorization of credit for transactions may be declined. All transactions, even those
    for which we have provided you with a receipt, are subject to our final verification.
17. Cardholder Privacy: We will provide you with a complete Privacy Notice on an annual basis. We may from time
    to time, review your credit, employment and income records. Your telephone calls with our service representatives
    may be recorded and may be listened to in order to evaluate the quality of service we provide to you. We may use
    automated telephone equipment or pre-recorded telephone calls to contact you about your Account. We may offer a

Credit Card Regulations 

1. 
RESPONSIBILITY �If you apply for and receive a Card from us, you agree to these Regulations. You also agree to repay all debts and any FINANCE CHARGE or any other fees or charges arising from the use of your Card and the Card account. For example, you are responsible for charges made by you and anyone else to whom you give the Card, and this responsibility continues until you recover and return the Card to us. Except to the extent allowed by law, you cannot disclaim responsibility by notifying us and your responsibility continues even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which we are not a party may direct you or one of the other persons responsible to pay the account. 

2. 
CREDIT LINE �We will establish a Credit Line for you and advise you of its amount. You agree not to let the account balance exceed the Credit Line, but you remain responsible for payment if it does. Any account balance in excess of the Credit Line is payable immediately. We reserve the right to reduce or increase your Credit Line from time to time, or to revoke the Card, without affecting your obligation to pay the account balance. The Cards remain our property, and if we request, you must recover and surrender to us all Cards we have issued on your account. To obtain a STARTER CARD you must complete certain Educational requirements. 

3. 
USING THE CARD �To make a regular purchase or take a cash advance, present the Card to an authorized plan member or financial institution and sign the sales or cash advance draft which will be imprinted with your Card. You may also obtain a cash advance with the Card at certain manned and unmanned automated terminals. Regular transactions are counted against your Credit Line. You will receive a copy of the draft (or machine receipt at an unmanned terminal) which you should retain to verify your monthly statement. You may not use your Card for any illegal or unlawful transaction, and we may decline to authorize any transaction that we believe poses an undue risk of illegality or unlawfulness. 

4. 
CONVENIENCE CHECKS �We may, from time to time, supply you with personalized Convenience Checks that are subject to the following conditions. Only the person whose name is printed on a Convenience Check may sign it. All Convenience Checks must be written in U.S. dollars. We will not certify a Convenience Check. We are entitled to return a Convenience Check unpaid if there is not enough available credit on your account to pay it, if you are in default under this Agreement, if your Card or Convenience Check has been reported lost or stolen, if your Convenience Check is post�dated. if your right to use Convenience Checks has been canceled or suspended or if your account has been closed. In addition, we may refuse to honor a Convenience Check whenever we would be entitled to dishonor an ordinary check. If we refuse, under the terms of this Agreement, to honor a Convenience Check issued by you, we may charge your account a fee of $22.00. A Convenience Check cannot be used to make a payment on any amount owed under this Agreement. Any Convenience Check that we pay will be posted to your account as a cash advance and will be subject to all the terms in this Agreement that apply to cash advances. CFCU shall have no liability for any Convenience Check returned because it was written for an amount in excess of your available line of credit. Convenience Checks that you use and we pay will not be returned to you but will be identified on your monthly billing statement. The Wisconsin Uniform Commercial Code, as well as applicable CFCU policies and fees, will apply to Convenience Checks as if they were checks drawn on a share draft account. 

5. 
FEES AND CHARGES �There is no annual fee for your Card. 


a. 	
Late Payment Fee �A late payment fee of $ 22.00 may be charged in any billing cycle in which we receive less than the minimum payment on or before the 5th day after the due date. 

b. 	
Over�The�Credit�Limit Fee �A fee of $22.00 may be charged in any billing cycle in which at any time during the cycle the unpaid balance of your account exceeds your credit limit. 

c. 	
Cash Advance Fee �A fee of $5.00 may be charged for each cash advance. 

d. 	
Minimum Finance Charge �A minimum finance charge of $.50 may be charged in any month in which there is an outstanding balance. 

e. 	
Returned Check Fee �A fee of $22.00 may be charged for any check used to pay a monthly payment that is returned NSF. 

f. 	
Non�Sufficient Funds Fee � A fee of $22.00 may be charged if you do not have enough funds in your account to cover a payment made by check. 

g. 	
International Transaction Fee � A fee of 1% of the amount of transactions and cash advances made in foreign countries. 



6. 
FINANCE CHARGES �Your account will be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE during any billing period during which you (a) received, or had outstanding, a cash advance, or (b) failed to pay in full the Previous Balance shown on the statement during the first 25 days of the statement period (the ""Grace Period""). Except as otherwise provided herein, the FINANCE CHARGE on your VISA or MASTERCARD Card account is calculated by applying the monthly periodic rate of .74917% �1.5825% (ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 8.99% �18.99%) to the average daily balance (including new purchases) of your account in each month. To get the ""average daily balance"" we take the Previous Balance reduced by any payment you make, credits we apply, and any Late Payment Fee due and increased by any cash advances posted during the statement period. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add all the daily balances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance."" You can avoid incurring a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases by paying the New Balance in full within the Grace Period. However, a FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances from the later of the date made or the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted, and will continue to accrue on any such cash advances until your payment is received. 

Starter Cards Only �Anything in the above paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, if you are in default (as defined in Paragraph 8) the FINANCE CHARGE on your Card account is calculated by applying the monthly periodic rate of 1.1.658% (ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 13.99%) to the average daily balance (including new purchases)of your account. 

7. 
MONTHLY PAYMENT �Unless there has been no activity on your account since your last statement and your account shows a zero balance, we will mail you a statement every month showing your Previous Balance, the current transactions on your account, the remaining regular credit available under your Credit Line, the fees and finance charge, the New Balance, and the Minimum Payment due. Every month you must pay at least the minimum payment within the Grace Period. You may, of course, pay more than the Minimum Payment. If you pay the New Balance in full before the expiration of the Grace Period, you will reduce or avoid the FINANCE CHARGE. The Minimum Payment will be 2.5% of your New Balance, or $10.00, whichever is greater, or your full New Balance, if it is less than $10.00. In addition, if you have exceeded your Credit Line, your Minimum Payment will include the full amount by which your New Balance exceeds your Credit Line. We will apply your payment first to the FINANCE CHARGE, then to any late charges, and then to your balance in the order transactions were posted to your account. Unless you direct otherwise, we will apply any excess over the Minimum Payment to your balance which is part of the Amount Subject to Interest. A minimum payment is required for every statement period that you carry a balance, and any additional amount paid, while reducing your balance, will not prepay any future Minimum Payments. 

8. 
DEFAULT �You will be in default if you fail to make the Minimum Payment on time twice during any 12 month period. You will also be in default if your ability to repay us or the value to our security interest is materially reduced by a change in your employment, an increase in your obligations, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving you, you or your spouse�s death, or your failure to abide by these Regulations. We have the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance if you do not cure your default within 15 days after we send you a written default notice. We have this right, without notice, if the default is your third within 12 months and we notified you of the prior two. 

9. 
SECURITY INTEREST �Each purchase and cash advance through your account constitutes a loan made by us to you in the State of Wisconsin. You agree that the Wisconsin Consumer Act applies to all these loans even though you may use them for business purposes, or you are a person not otherwise covered by the Act. To secure each purchase loan, you grant us a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code in any goods you purchase with it. If you default, we will have the right to recover any of these goods which have not been fully paid for through our application of your payments in the manner described in Paragraph 7. If you give or have given us any other security interests for all your debts, your Card account will also be secured by the property described in those security agreements (except your home, home furnishings, appliances and clothing). You also agree to grant a security interest in all shares and deposits now or hereafter held in Community First Credit Union, except funds held in an Individual Retirement Account or Keough/SEP plan, as security for amounts owed under this agreement. You authorize Community First Credit Union to apply these shares and deposits, in the event of default, and to pay said amounts to the credit union. 

10. 
ACCURACY OF INFORMATION �You certify that the information you have given Community First Credit Union for the purpose of obtaining credit is true and complete. Inaddition,youauthorizeCommunityFirstCreditUniontoverifyorcheckanyoftheinformationgivenandobtainadditionalinformationconcerning your credit standing (including your spouse�s if married and live in a community property state.) 

11. 
MARITAL PROPERTY �You agree that the credit granted will be incurred in the interest of marriage or family. 

12. 
CREDITS �If plan members who honor your Card give you credit for returns or adjustments, they will do so by sending us a credit slip which we will post to your account. We will apply those credits first to offset your current purchases, and then to your Previous Balance. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe us, we will hold and apply this credit balance against future purchases and cash advances, or refund it on your written request if it is $1.00 or more. We will make a good faith attempt to return to you any credit balance which remains in your account for more than six months. 

13. 
FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS �Foreign Transactions, purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed to you in 


U.S. dollars. (A foreign transaction is any transaction where the merchant country differs from the country of the card issuer.) The conversion into dollars will be made in accordance with the operating rules for international transactions established by MasterCard International, Inc., or Visa USA, Inc. and may occur on a date other than the date of the transaction; therefore the currency conversion rate may be different than the rate in effect at the time of the transaction. We do not determine the currency conversion rate that is used nor do we receive any portion of the currency conversion rate. For VISA, Inc., the exchange rate to dollars will be a rate in effect for the applicable central processing date and is selected by VISA, Inc., either from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets; or the government mandated rate. VISA USA, Inc., charges Community First Credit Union a 1% conversion fee on all foreign transactions including purchases, cash withdrawals or advances and credits. MasterCard International Inc., charges Community First Credit Union a .8% Cross�border transaction fee. A cross�border transaction is one in which the cardholder country differs from the country of the merchant. This fee will be assessed regardless of the transaction currency. In addition, a .2% Currency Conversion Fee will be assessed on all transactions where MasterCard must convert a transaction to the cardholder�s billing currency. Community First Credit union will pass these fees on to you and will be shown independently of the transaction on your billing statement. 
14. 
PLAN MEMBER DISPUTES �We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan member or financial institution to honor your Card. You must resolve directly with the plan member any disputes regarding goods or services you purchase with the Card, unless (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement we sent or participated in sending you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made from a plan member in your state or within 100 miles of your home. 

15. 
UNAUTHORIZED USE �You authorize us to pay from your account all items reflecting credit purchases or cash advances made with the card in spite of the absence of your signature on the draft or the lack of presentation of the Card. You may be liable for unauthorized use of your Card. However, YOU WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE WHICH OCCURS AFTER YOU NOTIFY PAYMENT SYSTEMS FOR CREDIT UNIONS, INC. (�PSCU�) SECURITY CENTER, 1�800�449�7728, OF THE LOSS, THEFT, OR POSSIBLE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR CARD. In any case, your liability for unauthorized use of your Card will not exceed $50.00. 

16. 
EFFECT OF REGULATIONS �These Regulations are the contract that applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances or credit slips you sign may contain different terms. We may amend these Regulations from time to time. If required by Section 422.415 of the Wisconsin Statutes, we will provide written notice of an amendment 90 days prior to the date the amendment is effective. Your use of the Card thereafter will indicate your agreement to the amendments. To the extent the law permits, and we indicate in our notice, amendments will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. No delay or omission in exercising any rights granted to us hereunder shall impair such rights or be construed to be a waiver thereof. No waiver whatsoever shall be valid unless signed in writing by us and then only to the extent set forth therein. 

17. 
TERMINATION �If you are a resident of Wisconsin, we may declare the account balance due and payable if we receive written notice from your spouse terminating the account. You will remain responsible for all amounts charged to your account both before and after receipt of such notice. Your spouse, however, will cease to be liable for extensions of credit to other cardholders on the 16th day after we receive his or her termination notice. Your privilege of using the Card and the account shall expire on the date shown on the Card. You may terminate your account relationship with us at any time by surrendering to us all your Cards but you will remain liable to us for full payment of any balance on your account. We may revoke your Card at any time without prior notification and without affecting your obligation to pay the account balance. 

18. 
CHANGE OF ADDRESS �We will send all account statements and any other notices concerning this account to your address as shown on our records. If you change your address, you must notify us of your new address immediately. 

19. 
APPLICABLE STATE LAWS �You hereby acknowledge that this agreement has been negotiated in the State of Wisconsin and that you have entered into this agreement in the State of Wisconsin. The validity, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all matters arising out of the issuance of your Card shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wisconsin. 

20. 
JOINT ACCOUNT �You agree that all parties to your account are authorized on your behalf to request credit limit increases, to agree to amendments or modifications to the account, to enter into settlements or agreements with us regarding the account, to request additional Cards, or to authorize others to transact business on the account. You agree to be jointly and severally liable for all charges to the account made or authorized by any other party to the account, whether or not such charges caused the account balances to exceed the credit limit.

In this Classic VISA Credit Card Agreement and Federal Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statement (�Agreement�) the words �I�, �me�, �my� and �mine� mean each and all of those who apply for, or who sign for or use the Card and/or Account.  The words �Credit Union�, �LAPFCU�, �you�, �your�, and �yours� mean Los Angeles Police Federal Credit Union. �Card� means the Classic VISA Credit Card(s) issued to me and any duplicates and/or renewals you may issue. �Account� means my Classic VISA Credit Card Account with you. 
By requesting and receiving, signing, using or permitting others to use the Card and/or Account issued to me by you, I agree to be bound by the terms and conditions as set forth herein and any amendments and/or change in terms thereto. 
AUTHORIZATION AND PAYMENT:  I authorize you to pay and charge my Account for all Purchases and Cash Advances made or obtained by me or anyone I authorize to use my Card or Account.  I will be obligated to pay all such Purchases and Cash Advances charged to my Account whether resulting from: (1) actual use of my Card or Convenience Checks; (2) mail order or telephone, computer, or other electronic Purchases made without presenting the Card; or (3) any other circumstance where I authorize a charge, or authorize someone else to make a charge, to my Account (collectively, �authorized charges�).  I promise to pay you or to your order in U.S. Dollars with an instrument drawn on a financial institution in the United States at your office or at the address set forth on my periodic statement all authorized charges on the terms and at the rates set forth herein, plus any FINANCE CHARGES assessed on my Account, and any other charges and fees which I may owe you under the terms of this Agreement (the �Account Balance�).  Payments will continue until I have paid in full the Account Balance.  To protect me and you, you may, in your sole discretion, place a temporary hold on the credit available to me any time you receive a payment of $1,000 or more from me via a payment method other than cash, certified funds or electronic transfer.  In such cases, the hold on my available credit will remain in place until payment is actually collected by you.
CHANGE OF TERMS:  Account and agreement terms are not guaranteed for any period of time.  I understand and agree that you may amend, modify, add to, or delete from this Agreement any of its terms and conditions, including financial terms such as the method of application and the amount of any FINANCE CHARGE, ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, monthly periodic rate and/or fee in accordance with applicable laws, by mailing a notice of the change to me at my last known address.  I also understand that in the event of a significant change, as defined under the federal Truth in Lending Act, any such notice will be mailed at least forty-five (45) days prior to the effective date of the significant change as required by applicable law.  I will have the right to reject significant changes to this Agreement prior to the effective date of such changes, unless I fail to make a required minimum payment within sixty (60) days after its due date.  If I reject any such significant change, you reserve the right to close my Account and require me to repay the Account Balance at terms no less favorable to me than your choice of the following:  (1) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement in effect as of the date I notify you of my rejection; (2) by recalculating my Minimum Monthly Payment based on a five (5) year amortization of my Account Balance from the date I notify you of my rejection; or (3) by recalculating my Minimum Monthly Payment based on a percentage of the Account Balance that is no more than twice the percentage required on the date I notify you of my rejection.  Regardless of whether I reject the significant changes, the new terms will apply to any transactions that occur more than fourteen (14) days after you provide notice of the change in terms to me.  You may change the terms of this Agreement based on information in my credit report, market conditions, business strategy or for any other reason.  Notice of a change in terms is required, but may be sent as late as the effective date of the change where the change has been agreed to in writing, by me.
FINANCE CHARGES: The FINANCE CHARGE for a billing cycle will be the sum of three (3) components set forth below.  I understand and agree that under the �Change of Terms� section above, you have the right in your sole and absolute discretion to change the amount of any ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, Monthly Periodic Rate and/or FINANCE CHARGE that may apply to my Account.
Cash Advance Fee:  One (1) component of the FINANCE CHARGE is the Cash Advance Fee. Cash Advance transactions are subject to a Cash Advance Fee which shall be the greater of $2.00 or 2% of the amount of the advance which is posted to the Account during the billing cycle, but not to exceed $25.00 per Cash Advance.  In addition, a Cash Advance Fee may not cause the FINANCE CHARGE to exceed the maximum rate permitted for a federal credit union. Cash Advances are subject to the Monthly Periodic Rate (see below) during the billing cycle in which the Cash Advance Fee is imposed. 
Foreign Transactions Fee:  The second (2nd) component of the FINANCE CHARGE is the Foreign Transactions Fee.  Purchases, Cash Advances, and credit transactions made in foreign currencies are subject to a Foreign Transactions Fee FINANCE CHARGE of 1.0% of the amount of the Purchase, Cash Advance, or credit transaction which is posted to the Account during the billing cycle. International Purchases, Cash Advances, and credit transactions that are not made in foreign currencies are subject to a Foreign Transactions Fee FINANCE CHARGE of .8% of the amount of the Purchase, Cash Advance, or credit transaction which is posted to the Account during the billing cycle.
Monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE, Monthly Periodic Rate, and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE :  The third (3rd) component of the FINANCE CHARGE is the Monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE.  The initial monthly periodic rate is a discounted monthly periodic rate with an initial discounted ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, as disclosed on the enclosed insert.  The initial discounted monthly periodic rate will remain in effect during my first six (6) monthly billing cycles unless I fail to make a payment when due or I make a payment that is returned (for further information, please refer to the PENALTY ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE section below).  Thereafter, the Monthly Periodic Rate used in calculating the monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are disclosed on the enclosed insert.  The Monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE is imposed as follows: 
Cash Advances:  A periodic FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on Cash Advances that I obtain through the use of my Card as of the date of each such Cash Advance and will continue to accrue until the Cash Advance is repaid. 
Credit Purchases of Goods and Services:  A periodic FINANCE CHARGE will be calculated on credit purchases that I obtain with my Card as of the date such credit purchase is posted to my Account and will continue to accrue until the date of repayment.  Periodic FINANCE CHARGES will be imposed on credit purchases only if they are not paid in full within twenty-five (25) days after the Statement Closing Date (�Grace Period�). 
MINIMUM FINANCE CHARGE:  A minimum FINANCE CHARGE of $0.50 will be assessed whenever a monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE is imposed.
MONTHLY PERIODIC FINANCE CHARGE, MONTHLY PERIODIC RATE AND ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE:  The Monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE for each billing cycle will be calculated by applying the Average Daily Balance (described below) for my Account for the billing cycle by the Monthly Periodic Rate.  The Monthly Periodic Rate is determined by dividing the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE by 12. 
PENALTY ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE:  A penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 17.90% (corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate of 1.492%) may be applied to my Account Balance if I fail to make a payment when due or I make a payment that is returned.  You will provide me notice of such penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE at least forty-five (45) days prior to the effective date of the penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE.  I will have the right to reject the penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE prior to the effective date of such penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, unless I fail to make a required minimum payment within sixty (60) days after its due date.  If I reject the penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, you reserve the right to close my Account and require me to repay the Account Balance at terms no less favorable to me than your choice of the following:  (1) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement in effect as of the date I notify you of my rejection; (2) by recalculating my Minimum Monthly Payment based on a five (5) year amortization of my Account Balance from the date I notify you of my rejection; or (3) by recalculating my Minimum Monthly Payment based on a percentage of the Account Balance that is no more than twice the percentage required on the date I notify you of my rejection.  Regardless of whether I reject the penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, such rate will apply to any transactions that occur more than fourteen (14) days after you provide notice of the penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE to me.  My ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will revert to the applicable �standard� ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE provided for in this Agreement, provided that I make six (6) consecutive Minimum Monthly Payments when due.
HOW TO COMPUTE THE CASH ADVANCES BALANCE (CONSISTING OF TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO CASH AND OTHER ADVANCE TRANSACTIONS) UPON WHICH PERIODIC FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED: 
Average Daily Balance (including current Cash Advance transactions):  You figure a portion of the FINANCE CHARGE on my Account by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate to the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including current Cash Advances).  To get the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advance transactions you take the beginning balance of Cash Advance transactions on my Account each day, add any new Cash Advances, and subtract any payments or credits, and unpaid FINANCE CHARGES.  This gives you the daily balance of Cash Advance transactions.  Then, you add up all the daily balances of Cash Advance transactions for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle.  This gives you the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advance transactions.  There is no grace period in order to avoid the imposition of FINANCE CHARGES on Cash Advances.  However, the combination of periodic FINANCE CHARGES, Cash Advance Fee and Foreign Transactions Fee, will not exceed the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE permitted under applicable law.
HOW TO COMPUTE THE PURCHASE BALANCE (CONSISTING OF TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES) UPON WHICH PERIODIC FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED: 
Average Daily Balance (including current Purchase transactions):  To avoid incurring an additional Periodic FINANCE CHARGE on the balance of Credit Purchases reflected on my periodic statement and on any new Credit Purchases appearing on my next periodic statement, I must pay the New Balance shown on my statement on or before the Payment Due Date.  You figure a portion of the FINANCE CHARGE on my Account by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate to the Average Daily Balance of Credit Purchases (including current Purchase transactions).  To get the Aver-age Daily Balance of Purchase transactions you take the beginning balance of Purchase transactions on my Account each day, add any new Purchases, and subtract any payments or credits, and unpaid FINANCE CHARGES.  This gives you the daily balance of Purchase transactions.  Then, you add up all the daily balances of Purchase transactions for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle.  This gives you the Average Daily Balance of Purchase transactions.  I have a 25 day grace period from the close of the statement period to pay the New Balance of Purchase transactions without incurring additional FINANCE CHARGES.  If the New Balance of Purchase transactions is not paid in full during this grace period, FINANCE CHARGES will be assessed using the Average Daily Balance method as explained above.
This determines my total periodic FINANCE CHARGES for the billing cycle.  Actual periodic FINANCE CHARGES will be shown on my periodic statement. 
CREDIT LIMIT:  You will establish a Credit Limit for me. At your discretion, you may increase or decrease my Credit Limit at any time, and may provide separate limits for Purchases and Cash Advances.  You will notify me if you do, either by mail or through my periodic statement.  If I object to any Credit Limit increase, I must notify you immediately in writing.  Upon receipt of such notice, my Credit Limit will be reduced to its prior limit, however, I will be responsible to pay any amounts by which I have exceeded the reduced limit.  I agree not to allow my Account Balance to exceed my Credit Limit.  I agree to advise you of any change in my financial condition which may affect my creditworthiness.  I agree to update the credit information that I have provided you, from time to time, on your demand.  I or my joint applicant for the Account may request a change to the Credit Limit orally, in writing, or electronically, but any such request must be approved by you.  If my Credit Limit is increased, I am immediately responsible for the new Credit Limit and any increase in the Account Balance even when it differs from an amount previously agreed to orally or in writing. 
MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT:  Every month, I must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date shown on my periodic statement.  By separate agreement, I may authorize you to automatically transfer the Minimum Payment Due from my Credit Union share or share draft account.  I may, of course, pay more frequently, pay more, or pay the Account Balance in full, and I will reduce my periodic FINANCE CHARGE by doing so.  The Minimum Payment Due will be either:  (a) 2% of my Account Balance, or $20, whichever is greater; or (b) my Account Balance, if it is less than $20.  In addition, I must pay any amount on my periodic statement listed as past due and any late charge.  At any time my Account Balance exceeds my Credit Limit, I must pay the excess. 
The �Payment Due Date� will be shown on my periodic statement. 
I understand and agree that any Minimum Monthly Payment made by me will be applied in the following order:  (a) unpaid fees and charges, if any; (b) unpaid periodic FINANCE CHARGE due on both Purchases and Cash Advances; (c) outstanding balances of Cash Advances and Purchases previously billed; and (d) current Cash Advances and Purchases.  Any payment I make in excess of the Minimum Monthly Payment will be applied in the following order:  (a) my Account Balance subject to a penalty ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE; (b) my Cash Advance Balance; (c) my Purchases Balance; and (d) any remaining portion of my Account Balance in the order that my Minimum Monthly Payment would be applied.  
LATE PAYMENT FEE:  If you have not received my Minimum Payment Due within ten (10) days after the �Payment Due Date� listed on my periodic statement, I agree to pay a Late Payment Fee as set forth in the enclosed Schedule of Fees which accompanies this Agreement and is incorporated by reference herein as though set forth in full.  
RETURNED PAYMENT FEE:  If a payment that was applied to my Account is returned to you unpaid for any reason I agree to pay a Returned Payment Fee as set forth in the enclosed Schedule of Fees.  This fee will also apply to any payments made by automatic transfer that cannot be posted due to insufficient funds in my regular share or checking account.  
CASH ADVANCE FEE:  For each Cash Advance, a Cash Advance Fee of either $2 or 2% of the amount of the Advance will be charged, whichever is greater, subject to a maximum fee of $25 for each Cash Advance transaction.  Cash Advance transactions include ATM withdrawals, online funds transfers, telephonic funds transfers, and in person Cash Advances at a financial institution�s branch from the Account.  
CREDIT LIFE AND/OR DISABILITY INSURANCE: The purchase of this insurance is entirely voluntary and is not a factor in the approval of the extension of credit.  If credit life and/or disability insurance is available to me on the Account, and I request it by completing the Credit Insurance Application/Schedule which contains current rates and qualifying information, the premium will be calculated monthly by multiplying the premium rate by the outstanding balance on the Account.  You will add the premium amount to my Account Balance on each Billing Cycle Close Date.  I acknowledge receiving a copy of the Credit Insurance Application/Schedule. 
PREPAYMENT OR IRREGULAR PAYMENTS: Though I need only pay the Minimum Payment Due, I understand that I have the right to repay my Account Balance at any time without penalty.  I also understand and agree that I will only be charged periodic FINANCE CHARGES to the date I repay my entire Account Balance.  I may make larger payments without penalty and this may reduce the total amount of periodic FINANCE CHARGES that I will repay.  If I pay more than the Minimum Payment Due in any month and there is still a balance due, I must continue to make Minimum Payments in future months.  Any partial payment of my Account Balance will not advance my next payment due date(s).  I understand and agree that any payment that: (a) delays or (b) accelerates the repayment of my Account Balance will:  (a) increase or (b) decrease my Monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE. 
PAYMENTS BY AUTOMATIC TRANSFER:  If I request payment by automatic transfer, I understand and agree that no payment can or will be made if there are insufficient or uncollected funds in the designated account to make the scheduled payment.  Should this event occur, I under-stand and agree that I will not be released from making the payment.  Any automatic transfer I have requested will remain in effect until I cancel it in writing or the Account Balance is paid in full.  You may cancel this service at your discretion.
DEFAULT:  I will be in default if: (1) I do not pay on time or in the proper amount(s); (2) I have made a false or misleading statement on my application; (3) I fail to live up to any of the terms of this Agreement; (4) my creditworthiness is impaired; or (5) I die, become insolvent or am the subject of bankruptcy or receivership proceedings.  In the event of any action by you to enforce this Agreement, I agree to pay the costs thereof, including reasonable attorneys� fees, and other expenses.  I understand and agree that FINANCE CHARGES at the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE as permitted under this Agreement will continue to accrue until I repay my entire Account Balance.
ACCELERATION AND COLLECTION COSTS:  Upon my default, I understand and agree that you have the right to temporarily or permanently suspend any and all Account and Card privileges and/or you may demand immediate payment of the Account Balance, including FINANCE CHARGES, Late Payment Fees, and your collection costs, reasonable attorneys� fees, and court costs (collectively �collection-related charges�), and all other fees and charges hereunder.  I understand and agree that I will be subject to FINANCE CHARGES (at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate), Late Payment Fees, collection-related charges, and all other fees and charges under the terms disclosed in this Agreement, until I repay my entire Account Balance.  In the event of any action by you to enforce this Agreement, I agree to pay the costs thereof, reasonable attorneys� fees, and other expenses.
ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER:  In the event the use of the Card, the Account or the Account number of the Card constitutes an Electronic Fund Transfer, the terms and conditions of my Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement with you shall govern such transactions to the extent the Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement expands or amends this Agreement. 
PURCHASES AND ADVANCES:  I may make purchases and request advances in accordance with then current loan policies up to my Credit Limit.  I understand and agree that all purchases and other transactions requested by me or anyone I have permitted to use the Card(s) and/or Account are subject to your approval. 
USING THE CARD:  To make a Purchase or obtain an Advance, I may present the Card or Card number to a participating VISA plan merchant, to you or to another financial institution that accepts Classic VISA Credit Cards and sign or authorize a sales or Cash Advance draft.  Certain purchases and Cash Advances will require an authorization prior to completion of the transaction.  In some cases, I may be asked to provide identification. If I have received a personal identification number (�PIN�), I may also use my Card and PIN to obtain Cash Advances at any Automatic Teller Machine (�ATM�) that accepts my Card or other type of electronic terminal that provides access to the VISA system.  (Not all ATMs accept Classic VISA Credit Cards.)  My PIN is confidential and should not be disclosed to anyone.  I agree not to write my PIN on my Card, I will not keep my Card and PIN together, and I will not provide my PIN to anyone who is not an authorized user.  Advances through ATM access will be treated as Cash Advances.  Advances at authorized ATMs are limited to a total of $300.00 per day.  I may also provide my Card number verbally, electronically, or in writing to a merchant to complete a mail, electronic or telephone transaction.
If your authorized system is not working, I may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if I have sufficient available credit. Occasionally for security reasons, you may block usage of my Card and/or Account in certain foreign countries or geographical areas.  You will not be liable to me if any of these events happen. 
My Card and/or Account may not be used directly or indirectly for:  (1) any illegal activity or transaction; or (2) any gambling, gaming, betting or similar activity or transaction. Further, I may not utilize my Card and/or Account for the purchase of any goods or services on the Internet that involve gambling, betting or any similar activity or transaction. Such transactions include, but may not be limited to, any quasi-cash or online gambling transaction, any electronic commerce transaction conducted over an open network, and any betting transaction including the purchase of lottery tickets or casino gaming chips or off-track betting or wagering.  However, in the event that a charge or transaction described in this paragraph is approved and processed, I will still be responsible for such charges. 
FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS:  Purchases, cash advances and credits made in foreign currencies will be billed to my Account in U.S. dollars.  The conversion to U.S. dollars will be made in accordance with the VISA operating regulations for international transactions.  Such regulations provide for either a .8% currency exchange fee for single currency transactions (transactions made internationally without a currency conversion) or 1% currency exchange fee for multi-currency international transactions (transactions made internationally that require a currency conversion), which is added to the amount of the purchase, cash advance, or credit and retained by VISA.  Transactions conducted in U.S. military bases, territories, embassies, or consulates are not considered international transactions and will not be subject to the .8% currency exchange fee.  The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by VISA from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date.  The conversion rate may be different than the rate on the day of the transaction or date of the posting of the Account.  When a credit to the Account does not fully offset a charge to the Account due to changes in the rate, I am responsible for the differences. 
RESPONSIBILITY:  I agree to repay you according to the terms of this Agreement for all purchases, advances, FINANCE CHARGES, Late Payment Fees, and all other fees and charges, if any, arising from the use of the Card and/or Account by me or any other person I permit to use the Account, even if that person exceeds my permission.  I cannot disclaim responsibility by notifying you, although you will close the Account if I so request and I will return all Cards to you and I will repay the unpaid balance to you.  My obligation to pay the Account balance continues even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which you are not a party may direct me or one of the other persons responsible to pay the Account.  Any person using the Account and/or Card is jointly and severally responsible with me for charges he or she makes, but if that person signs the Card he or she becomes a party to this Agreement and is also responsible for all charges on the Account, including mine.  The Cards remain your property and I must recover and surrender to you all Cards upon your request and/or upon termination of this Account. 
TRANSACTION SLIPS:  My periodic statement will identify the merchant, electronic terminal or financial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, Cash Advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the periodic statement.  I will retain the copy of such slips furnished at the time of the transaction in order to verify my periodic statement.  You may assess a reasonable fee for any photocopies or slips I request. 
PLAN MERCHANT DISPUTES:  You are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution or electronic terminal to honor the Account and/or Card.  You are subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services I purchase with the Card only if I have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant, and: (a) my purchase was made in response to an advertisement you sent or participated in sending me; or (b) my purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made from a plan merchant in my state or within 100 miles of my current mailing address.  Any other dispute I must resolve directly with the plan merchant. 
RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS:  Merchants and others who honor the Account and/or Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending you a credit slip which you will post to my Account.  If my credits and payments exceed what I owe you, you will hold and apply this credit balance against future Purchases and Advances, or if it is $1.00 or more, refund it on my written request. 
UNAUTHORIZED USE:  If I notice the loss or theft of my Card 
or a possible unauthorized use of my Card, I should write to you 
immediately at:  P. O. Box 10188, Van Nuys, California 91410-
0188, or call you at (877) 695-2732.  I will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after I notify you.  I may, however, be liable for unau-thorized use that occurs before my notice to you.  In any case, my liability will not exceed $50.   My liability may be zero ($0) in cases of VISA Credit Card fraud in accordance with current VISA U.S.A., Inc. Operating Regulations.  This does not apply to ATM transactions using the Card and PIN. 
SURRENDER OF CARD(S):  The Card(s) remains your property and, if you request, I must surrender to you all Cards you have issued on the Account. 
LOST OR STOLEN CARD(S) NOTIFICATION AND LIABILITY:  
I will notify you AT ONCE by immediately calling you at (866) 604-
0381 or, if I am outside the U.S., call collect at (727) 570-4881 if I believe that the Card, Account number, PIN or any combination of the three has been lost or stolen.  Telephoning is the best way of keeping my possible losses down.  I understand that my total liability to you shall not exceed $50.00 for any Account and/or Card transactions resulting from the loss, theft or unauthorized use of the Account and/or Card that occurs prior to the time I give notice to you.  Such liability does not apply when the Account and/or Card is used to make an electronic transfer.
PAYMENTS MARKED �PAID IN FULL�:  You may accept checks, money orders, or other types of payment marked �payment in full� or using other language to indicate full satisfaction of indebtedness, without being bound by such language or waiving any rights under this Agreement.  Full satisfaction of indebtedness shall be accepted by you only in written agreement, signed by an authorized representative of the Credit Union. 
DELAY IN ENFORCEMENT:  You can delay enforcing any of your rights under this Agreement without losing them. 
GOVERNING LAW:  I understand and agree that this Agreement is made in California and shall be governed by the laws of the State of California to the extent that California law is not inconsistent with controlling federal law.  I also understand and agree that California�s choice of law rules shall not be applied if they would result in the application of non-California law. 
INTEGRATED DOCUMENT(S):  Any separate sheet of paper labeled �Addendum to the Classic VISA Credit Card Agreement and Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement� which is delivered together with this form is an integral part of the Agreement and is incorporated herein as if set forth in full. 
MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENT:  I understand and agree that I must be and remain a member in good standing with you to be eligible for continuing Account and/or Card privileges including future purchases and advances.  I understand and agree that you may suspend the Account and/or Card privileges during any period in which I do not maintain my membership in good standing with you. 
TERMINATION:  You may terminate this Agreement upon my default.  Either you or I may terminate this Agreement for other good cause.  In no event shall any termination relieve me of my obligation to repay sums already borrowed, FINANCE CHARGES, Late Payment Fees, and all other fees and charges hereunder, if any.  I agree to return all of the Cards issued to me or any party designated by me. 
CREDIT INFORMATION:  I authorize you to investigate my credit when opening, renewing or reviewing the Account, and I authorize you to disclose information regarding the Account to credit bureaus and other creditors who inquire of you about my credit standing to the extent authorized by law.  I understand that you may provide information to credit bureaus about negative information concerning my Account (such as my insolvency, delinquency, late payment or default on my Account) which the credit bureaus may include in my credit report. 
CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, EMPLOYMENT STATUS:  I understand and agree that I must report to you any change in my name, address, employment status, or any other information that may negatively affect my creditworthiness. 
ACCURACY OF INFORMATION:  The information provided in my request for credit (Application) is accurate and I will notify you in writing imme-diately if there is a change in my financial condition.  You may retain the Application.  I understand that it is a violation of Section 1014,",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

This credit card account (""Account"") is provided by Woodforest National Bank. 
Your contract with us is contained in this Cardholder Agreement and your application 
or solicitation response for the Account (together, the �Agreement�). 
Please read the Agreement and keep it for your records. In this Agreement and 
unless the context indicates otherwise, the words ""you,"" ""your"" and ""yours"" 
mean the Cardholder(s) and each person(s) who use(s) any Card or Account 
with your permission. The words ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our"" and ""Bank"" mean Woodforest

of this Agreement when a Cardholder, or a person who you authorize 
(an �Authorized User�), accepts, signs or uses the Card or Account. 

Terms and Conditions 

This Agreement governs the terms and conditions of your Account with us. Customers 
are given this Agreement when approved for an Account, or on request. 
By opening an Account and making Transactions (as defined below), you agree 
to use this Account only for personal, family or household purposes and to comply 
with, and be bound by, this entire Agreement. You should retain and carefully 
review this entire Agreement. You and we agree as follows: 

1. Accepting this Agreement. This Agreement will be effective on the earlier 
of the date (a) you sign or otherwise submit an application for the Account that 
we approve; or (b) you use, or someone authorized by you uses, the Card or the 
Account. You acknowledge and agree that any use of a Card, signing of an Account 
application or other document, or other acceptance of the Account or the 
Card constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 
2. Promise to Pay. By using your Card or your Account, you agree to pay us an 
amount equal to the sum of all Transactions made in connection with, and 
posted to, your Account plus any FINANCE CHARGES (as defined below), fees 
and other charges provided for in this Agreement, regardless of the medium by 
which the Transaction occurs. If two or more persons establish your Account, 
each of you, together and individually, is responsible for all amounts owed, even 
if the Account is used by only one of you. 
3. Your Responsibility. You are responsible for all Transactions and other transactions 
arising from the authorized use of your Account or Card by you by any 
means. If you have authorized another person to use your Account or Card in 
any manner, that authorization will be deemed to include the authorization to 
make Transactions of any kind using your Account or Card and to incur related 
fees and charges, and such authorization will be deemed to continue until you 
have taken all steps necessary to revoke it by preventing such use by that person. 
We are not responsible for controlling any person who you have asked us 
to add to your Account or someone you let use your Account or Card. If you let 
someone use your Account or Card, you are responsible for all Transactions 
made in connection with, and posted to, your Account plus all FINANCE 
CHARGES, fees and other charges. If you wish to remove such person�s ability 
to use your Account or Card, you must notify us in writing. No such notice will 
be effective until we receive and have had a reasonable opportunity to act on it. 
How to Use Your Card and Access Your Account 

4. Credit Limit. You agree that we may establish an Account credit limit and 
that the sum of all Transactions made in connection with, and posted to, your 
Account, plus any FINANCE CHARGES, fees and other charges provided for 
September 2007 G - 10285 


in this Agreement, will not exceed your Account credit limit as communicated to 
you from time to time. Your initial Account credit limit will be disclosed in the 
document that accompanies your Card. The difference between the balances 
you owe us and your Account credit limit is referred to as your �Available Credit 
Limit�. We may refuse to authorize or accept any Transaction on your Account 
or Card that would cause you to exceed your Available Credit Limit. If we in our 
sole discretion decide to authorize or accept a Transaction on your Account or 
Card that would exceed your Available Credit Limit, we will not be liable to you 
if we do, and you agree that we may charge your Account the amount of the 
Transaction and an overlimit charge and other related fees provided for in this 
Agreement, request that you immediately repay us the amount in excess of your 
Available Credit Limit, suspend your Account or Card privileges and terminate 
this Agreement in a manner provided by this Agreement. We may from time to 
time and in our sole discretion change your Account credit limit, reduce your Account 
credit limit to $0 and close your Account, or limit the number or amount of 
Transactions on your Account based on an evaluation of various factors, including 
your credit history and your ability to repay amounts owed in connection with 
the Account or Card. We will promptly notify you in the event we decide to take 
such action on your Account. 

5. Purchases and Cash Advances. You may use your Account and your Card 
to purchase or obtain goods or services (each, a �Purchase�) by presenting your 
Card or your Account to participating merchants and establishments where the 
Card is honored. You may also use your Account to transfer balances from other 
creditors, to make other transactions by means of balance transfer coupons or 
checks, or for any other transactions that we encourage you to make through an 
introductory or promotional offer, each in accordance with such additional terms 
and conditions as we may offer from time to time. Unless we tell you otherwise, 
we will also treat any such balance transfer or other transaction as a Purchase. 
You may also use your Card (a) to obtain a loan from your Account; (b) by presenting 
it to any bank or other person that accepts the Card for the purpose of 
obtaining cash or cash-like equivalents (for example, money orders, traveler�s 
checks or other payment instruments) from your Account; (c) to make a withdrawal 
of cash from an automated teller machine (�ATM�); or (d) to make a person-
to-person transfer conducted through the Internet or otherwise (each such 
transaction, a �Cash Advance�). We will also treat as a Cash Advance any transaction 
using a Convenience Check (except for Convenience Checks issued to 
you as part of a promotional offer which, unless we tell you otherwise, will be 
treated as Purchases). Purchases and Cash Advances are collectively referred 
to as �Transactions�. You acknowledge and agree that any debt incurred using 
your Account or your Card is valid, regardless of the purpose of the Transaction. 
We may, from time to time, limit the type, number and dollar amounts of any 
Transactions made using your Account or Card, notwithstanding the amount of 
your Available Credit Limit, and terminate or suspend your use of your Account 
and Card and the operation of any method of access to your Account. You may 
not use your Card or Account for gambling or gaming, of any type or nature, 
and we may restrict your use of the Card or Account for such purposes. Additional, 
you may not use your Card or Account for any illegal activity or transactions. 
6. Convenience Checks. We may issue Convenience Checks to you that may 
be used to access your Account. Any Convenience Check that we pay will be 
posted to your Account as a Cash Advance (except for a Convenience Check 
issued to you as part of a promotional offer which, unless we tell you otherwise, 
will be treated as a Purchase) and will be deducted from your Available Credit 
Limit. Each Convenience Check must be denominated in United States (U.S.) 
dollars and completed and signed by you in the same manner as a personal 
check. If we provide you with Convenience Checks for your Account, you may 
not use them to pay any amount you owe under this Agreement. You may re

quest a stop payment on any Convenience Check; however, we may apply a fee 
for such. We reserve the right to return any Convenience Check unpaid if (a) the 
amount of the Convenience Check exceeds your Available Credit Limit; (b) your 
Account is not in good standing or you are otherwise in default of this Agreement; 
or (c) you use a Convenience Check to pay any amount you owe on your 
Account. We will not be liable if we choose to return any Convenience Check unpaid. 

7. Other Uses. We may make other methods of accessing your Account available 
to you from time to time. We will notify you of these other access methods 
as they become available. 
Lost Cards, Unauthorized Use of Account or Card and Other Concerns 

8. Unauthorized Use of Your Account or Card. You agree to promptly notify 
us if you believe that your Card has been lost or stolen or that someone has 
used or may use your Card or your Account without your permission by calling 
the Woodforest National Bank Card Center at 1-866-382-4048, or by writing to 
the Woodforest National Bank Card Center, P.O. Box 3038, Evansville, Indiana 
47730-3038. YOU SHOULD NEVER WRITE YOUR PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION 
NUMBER (PIN) ON YOUR CARD OR KEEP ANY WRITTEN RECORD 
OF IT ON ANY MATERIAL THAT IS KEPT WITH YOUR CARD. 
You agree to assist us in determining the facts, circumstances and other pertinent 
information related to any loss, theft or possible unauthorized use of your 
Account or Card and to comply with such procedures as we may require in connection 
with our investigation, including the filing of one or more reports with the 
appropriate law enforcement authorities. You acknowledge and agree that we 
will deem any such use as having been authorized by you, and you will be liable 
for the amount of any Transactions plus FINANCE CHARGES and fees and 
other charges incurred with any such use, if you fail to provide us with any such 
assistance or to comply with such procedures. 
You acknowledge and agree that unauthorized Card or Account use does not include 
use of your Card or your Account by any person to whom you have given 
authority to use your Card or Account. You further acknowledge and agree that 
you will be liable for all use by such a person, even if that person exceeds your 
authorization, until you have provided us with written notice that such person is 
no longer authorized to use your Account or Card and we have had a reasonable 
opportunity to act upon such notice. 

9. Third-Party Claims or Defenses. We are not responsible if a third party refuses 
to accept or honor your Card or Account, even if you have sufficient available 
credit, and except as required by applicable law, we will not be responsible 
for any claim or defense you may have against any third party that arises out of 
or in connection with any Transaction with your Account or Card or any services 
or goods or other property purchased or leased using your Account or Card. 
Paying Your Bills 

10. Periodic Account Statements. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, 
we will send you periodic Account Statements (�Account Statement�). Unless 
you make other arrangements with us, your Account Statement will be 
mailed to you by regular mail to your address as it appears in our records. 
We will send your Account Statement for each billing cycle at the end of which 
your Account has a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00 or on which a FINANCE 
CHARGE has been imposed. 
Your Account Statement will show all Transactions that have been posted to 
your Account since your last Account Statement, the payments and adjustments 
to your Account, the FINANCE CHARGES assessed for Transactions, any fees 
charged to your Account (the foregoing shall be collectively referred to as the 
�New Balance�), the outstanding balances on your Account, your Account credit 
limit and Available Credit Limit, the Minimum Amount Due and the Payment Due 
Date. 

11. Payments. Your payment is due on or before the Payment Due Date shown 
on your Account Statement. You must pay at least the Minimum Amount Due 
shown on your Account Statement on a monthly basis by the Payment Due 
Date, which, except as stated below under the section entitled Prepayment, will 
be the greater of (a) the sum of all FINANCE CHARGES then due and owing 
plus all fees then due and owing plus one percent (1%) of the outstanding principal 
balances or (b) $15.00. Any New Balance under $15.00 is payable in full. 
The minimum payment also will include any amount past due and any amount 
by which an account exceeds its Account credit limit. 
You agree to make all payments by check or other negotiable instrument drawn 
on a U.S. financial institution located in the U.S. or by money order. Payments 
must be denominated in U.S. dollars. All payments, except disputed payments, 
must be mailed or delivered to us at the remittance address indicated on the 
front of your Account Statement (�Payment Address�). Any payments received 
after 3:00 p.m., Central Time on any business day, will be credited on the next 
business day. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either 
to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer 
from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. If a payment 
is processed as an electronic fund transfer, the transfer will be for the 
amount of your check. When we use information from your check to make an 
electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as 
the same day you make or we receive your payment and you will not receive 
your check back from your financial institution. 
Credit to your Account may be delayed for up to 5 days if the payment is (a) not 
received at the Payment Address indicated on your Account Statement, (b) not 
made in U.S. dollars drawn on a U.S. financial institution located in the U.S. or 
by money order, or (c) not accompanied by the top portion of your Account 
Statement. Delayed crediting may cause you to incur additional fees and FINANCE 
CHARGES. (You understand that payments may not be made, and 
may not be deemed received by us, at any location other than the Payment Address.) 
We reserve the right to apply payments and other credits to your Account in any 
manner that we may choose in our sole discretion. All credits for payments to 
your Account are subject to final payment by the institution on which the item of 
payment was drawn. Although we may post payments as of the date we receive 
them, your Available Credit Limit may not be restored for up to 5 days after we 
receive your payment. 
12. Prepayment. You may pay without penalty all or a portion of the entire New 
Balance or more than your Minimum Amount Due. You understand that by making 
a prepayment, the total amount you owe us will be reduced but that you will 
not be relieved of your obligation to continue to pay the Minimum Payment Due 
in successive billing cycles as reflected in your Account Statement. 
Determination of Finance Charges 

13. Daily Periodic Rate. The Daily Periodic Rate is 1/365th of the corresponding 
ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (�APR�) rounded to the nearest 
1/100,000th of 1%, not to exceed the maximum allowed by applicable law. If the 
daily periodic rates and corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES increase, 
the FINANCE CHARGE will increase and your minimum payment due 
may be greater. If the FINANCE CHARGE is less than $1.00 in any billing cycle, 
we assess a minimum FINANCE CHARGE of $1.00. 
14. Annual Percentage Rate (APR) 
(a) The following information applies to your Account: 
APR for Purchases and Cash Advances. Your current APR and corresponding 
Daily Periodic Rate for Purchases and Cash Advances will be disclosed in 
the Account application or the document that accompanies your Card. The APR 
on your Account, which is based on the WSJ Prime Rate (as defined below) 
plus a margin, shall not be lower than 16.99% (corresponding Daily Periodic 

Rate of 0.04654%) and not exceed 23.00% (corresponding Daily Periodic Rate 
of 0.06301%). Please see the section entitled Variable APR for Purchases and 
Cash Advances for details regarding how this rate may change. The WSJ Prime 
Rate means the highest prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the 
day the rate is determined (or the previous day on which The Wall Street Journal 
was published if the paper is not published on that day). The date the rate is determined 
is the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of each month. 
Variable APR for Purchases and Cash Advances. The APR for Purchases 
and Cash Advances is based on the WSJ Prime Rate plus a margin. We will calculate 
the rate monthly by adding the margin applicable to your Account to the 
WSJ Prime Rate. This APR may vary (increase and decrease). Any increase or 
decrease in the WSJ Prime Rate will result in an increase or decrease in your 
Daily Periodic Rate and the APR, and as a result, the FINANCE CHARGE and 
the Minimum Amount Due will change and may result in a smaller part of your 
payment being applied to reduce principal. 
Changes to the Daily Periodic Rate and corresponding APR for Purchases and 
Cash Advances will be applied, as applicable, to your existing Account balance 
and to subsequent Transactions effective as of the first day of the billing cycle 
immediately following the month in which we calculate the rate. Subject to applicable 
law, we may change the Daily Periodic Rate and corresponding APR for 
Purchases and Cash Advances if you are in default of this Agreement, or if we 
in our sole discretion and from time to time decide to take such action. (Please 
see the sections of this Agreement entitled Changes to this Agreement and Default.) 


(b) Introductory Purchase, Balance Transfer and Promotional APR Offers. 
At our discretion, we may offer you an introductory or promotional APR for all 
or a part of your Transactions. For example, we may offer you a promotional 
APR to encourage specific transactions, such as transferring balances from accounts 
you have with others, or an introductory purchase APR to open an Account 
and to make Purchases. The period of time for which the introductory or 
promotional APR applies may be limited. Any introductory or promotional APR 
offer will be subject to the terms of the offer and this Agreement. If applicable, 
information regarding any introductory or promotional APR, the corresponding 
Daily Periodic Rate, and the period of time during which they are in effect will be 
disclosed in the Account application, the document that accompanies your Card, 
or in materials we send you about the offer after you obtain your Card. 
(c) APR for Delinquency. 
We reserve the right to increase the APR to a fixed ANNUAL PERCENTAGE 
RATE of 24.99% (corresponding fixed Daily Periodic Rate of 0.06846%) to the 
existing balance of your Account and to all subsequent Transactions posted to 
your Account if you fail to pay the Minimum Amount Due for two consecutive 
billing cycles. Once you become subject to this fixed APR and Daily Periodic 
Rate, we may change your APR back to the respective APR for your Account 
but only if you bring your Account current and then pay at least the Minimum 
Amount Due by the Payment Due Date for six (6) consecutive billing cycles. 
15. FINANCE CHARGES 
(a) Purchases. No Finance Charge will be imposed on Purchases if the New 
Balance shown on your Account Statement is paid in full within 25 calendar days 
from the billing date. If not paid in full, a FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed, 
from the date of posting of the Transaction, to the average daily balance for Purchases 
at the APR for Purchases until the date payment in full is posted to your 
Account. 
(b) Cash Advances. A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on Cash Advances 
from the date the Cash Advance is included in the average daily balance for 
Cash Advances at the APR for Cash Advances until the date payment in full is 
posted to your Account. There is no grace period or time period within which to 
pay to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on Cash Advances. 

16. Balance Subject to Finance Charge (Average Daily Balance). The total 
FINANCE CHARGE for your Account for a billing cycle is the sum of the FINANCE 
CHARGE for Purchases and the FINANCE CHARGE for Cash Advances. 
We calculate the FINANCE CHARGE as follows: 
We maintain and calculate separate daily balances for your Purchases, Cash 
Advances and promotional balances (each a �Balance Type�) and calculate a 
daily balance for each. To get the daily balances, we take the beginning balance 
for each Balance Type every day (unless, as to Purchases, your previous Account 
balance was paid in full by the Payment Due Date), which may include unpaid 
FINANCE CHARGES from previous billing periods, and any new 
transactions, any new fees, and any FINANCE CHARGE on the previous day�s 
balance, subtract any credits or payments credited as of that day, and make 
other adjustments. A credit balance is treated as a balance of zero. The balances 
subject to FINANCE CHARGES for the billing period are the average 
daily balances for each Balance Type. If you multiply the average daily balance 
by the number of days in the billing period and the applicable Daily Periodic 
Rate, the result is the periodic FINANCE CHARGE, except for minor variations 
caused by rounding. 
17. Fees. Subject to applicable law, you agree that we may, and you authorize 
us to, charge against your Account, the following fees in connection with the 
use of the Account or Card: 
(a) Annual Fee. Certain Cards have an annual fee. If your Card has an annual 
fee, the amount of the annual fee is disclosed in the application for your Account. 
This fee is assessed for the use of the Account and associated services, and will 
be identified as a Purchase on your Account Statement in the first billing cycle 
after you open your Account and annually thereafter. 
(b) Cash Advance Fee. There is a Cash Advance fee equal to the greater of 
$5.00 or 3% of the total dollar amount advanced for each Cash Advance on 
your Account. 
(c) Late Payment Fee. If we do not receive the Minimum Amount Due by the 
Payment Due Date, there is a late payment fee of $30.00, at that time and at 
monthly intervals thereafter as long as your Minimum Payment Due remains 
past due. 
(d) Over-the-credit-limit Charge. There is an overlimit charge of $30.00 if you 
exceed your Available Credit Limit during any billing cycle. 
(e) Returned Payment Fee. There is a returned payment fee of $29.00 each 
time a check or other instrument you have used for payment on your Account 
has been returned to us unpaid for any reason. 
(f) Foreign Currency Transaction Fee. There is a foreign currency transaction 
fee of an additional two percent (2%) of the gross amount provided to us by the 
Card association (or its affiliate). 
(g) Documentation Fee. We will provide copies of billing statements, sales 
drafts and payment instruments (""Items"") to you upon request. We will impose 
a fee of $5 for each copy of an Item unless prohibited by applicable law. This fee 
will be added to the Purchase balance in the Account. We will not impose any

18. Foreign Currency Transactions. If a transaction is made in a foreign currency, 
we and Discover� Network (�Discover Network�), will convert the transaction 
into a U.S. dollar amount. Discover Network will act in accordance with 
their operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time the 

transaction is processed. Currently, their regulations and procedures provide 
that the currency conversion rate they use is either (1) a wholesale market 
rate or (2) a government-mandated rate in effect one day prior to the processing 
date. Discover Network may increase this conversion rate by one 
percent and keep this increase. We increase the conversion rate provided to 
us by Discover Network by two percent (2%) and keep this increase. The currency 
conversion rate calculated in this manner that is in effect on the processing 
date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date or the posting date. 

Our Rights and How They Affect You 

19. Delay in Enforcement. We may at any time and in our sole discretion delay 
or waive enforcing any of our rights or remedies under this Agreement or under 
applicable law without losing any of those or any other rights or remedies. Even 
if we do not enforce our rights or remedies at any one time, we may enforce 
them at a later date. For example, we may accept late payments or payments 
that are marked ""payment in full"" or with other restrictive endorsements without 
losing any of our rights under this Agreement. 
20. Termination. Subject to applicable law, we may terminate this Agreement 
or revoke your right to use your Account or Card, along with your right to make 
future Transactions, at any time and for any reason including, without limitation, 
if you cease to maintain an active depository account relationship, in good standing, 
with the Bank. You may terminate your Account and use of the Card at any 
time by writing to the Woodforest National Bank Card Center, P.O. Box 3038, 
Evansville, Indiana, 47730-3038. Any request by you to terminate your Account 
will be effective only after we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on such 
request. The termination of this Agreement, whether initiated by us or you, will 
not affect any of your or our rights and obligations under this Agreement, including 
without limitation, your obligation to repay any amounts you owe us according 
to the terms of this Agreement, and any amendments made to this 
Agreement, which have arisen before the effective date of the termination of 
this Agreement, even if we allow a Transaction to be processed or posted with 
your Account or Card after this Agreement has been terminated. You agree to 
surrender to us or to destroy all of the Cards issued on your Account on our demand 
or on termination of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated and 
someone thereafter attempts to use a Card, the Card may be retained. A Card 
may not be returned or may be retained when you try to use it upon the occurrence 
of certain other events. 
21. Default. Subject to applicable law, your Account will be in default under this

Minimum Amount Due on or before your Payment Due Date, (e) any other creditor

(j) you are in default of any other credit agreement you have with any of our affiliates, 
or (k) we believe in good faith that the chances of your paying or performing 
your obligations under this Agreement have been impaired. The payment 
by you of any fee charged by us will not cure any default which caused the fee. 
If you fail to pay the Minimum Amount Due for two consecutive billing cycles, we 
will apply the fixed Daily Periodic Rate and corresponding fixed APR described 
in the section entitled APR for Delinquency. 
In addition, if your Account is in default under this Agreement, we may, subject 
to applicable law, (a) declare all or any portion of your outstanding Account balance 
to be immediately due and payable, (b) allow you to repay your Account

your Account and cancel all Cards issued on it, (d) reduce your Account credit 
limit or otherwise limit your ability to make Transactions as discussed in this 
Agreement, (e) commence an action against you to collect all amounts owed in

Advances. We also may charge you court costs and reasonable attorney�s fees 
that we actually incur as permitted by applicable law, if your Account is sent for 
collection to an attorney who is not our salaried employee. We will not be obligated 
to honor any attempted use of your Card or your Account if your Account 
is in default, or we have determined to terminate your Account or limit your ability 
to make Transactions as discussed in this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided 
for in this Agreement, FINANCE CHARGES will continue to accrue at the 
APR in effect at the time of default until your total Account balance, including 
such accrued FINANCE CHARGES, is paid in full. You agree that, subject to applicable 
law, if your Account is in default under this Agreement, you will accept 
calls from us at your home and your place of business regarding collection of 
your Account. You understand and agree that the calls to your home may be 
automatically dialed and a recorded message may be played. You agree such 
calls will not be considered ""unsolicited"" calls or telemarketing calls for purposes 
of state or federal law.

your financial condition and investigate any information you provided 
on your Account application at any time, and in the course of doing so, we may 
obtain a current credit report and ask you for any additional information about 
your financial condition by completing a Personal Financial Statement or such 
other form that we request from time to time. You authorize us and give us your 
permission to obtain any information about you that we believe would be beneficial 
to facilitate our determination of your eligibility (or continuing eligibility) for

We are not, however, under any obligation to monitor, record, retain or reproduce 
such items, unless required to do so by applicable law.

be arbitrated instead of litigated in court under the circumstances and procedures

VISA PLATINUM CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT RETAIL INSTALLMENT CREDIT AGREEMENT 
1 De?nitions: In this Agreement the words �we�, �us� and �our� mean Municipal Credit Union, 22 Cortlandt Street, New York, NewYork10007. Thewords�you�,�your�and�cardholder�mean anyone in whose name a VISA Platinum Card is issued. Annual Percentage Rate: The cost of your credit as a yearly rate. Finance Charge: The dollar amount the credit will cost you. 
2 Purchases: Your Card can be used to buy or lease goods or buy services any place that honors VISA. The debt that results from a Purchase will be transferred to us. 
3 Advances: Your Card can be used to obtain an advance (loan) at any of our branch of?ces, at any ?nancial institution which honors VISA or any other authorized location. If you have received a personal identi?cation number (PIN), you may use your Card and PIN to obtain advances at any ATM that accepts your Card. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, such advances shall be treated as Cash Advances under this Agreement.  
4 Convenience Checks: Upon request, and from time to time, we may send you convenience checks for use in borrowing under this Agreement. All convenience checks you use will be treated as cash advances under this Agreement unless we advise you otherwise. You may not use the convenience checks to make payments on any MCU credit card account. You understand that if you use a convenience check to make a purchase and you have a dispute with that purchase, the dispute is not covered by the Billing Rights Summary below. You understand that the convenience checks will not be returned to you. 
5 Purchases Treated as Cash Advances: 	We consider certain transactions to be the equivalent of cash advances, and we reserve the right to treat them as cash advances under this Agreement. Those transactions include using the Card or Account to purchase wire transfer money orders, money orders that are not issued by a ?nancial institution or are not in U.S. currency, travelers checks, casino gaming chips, lottery tickets, off-track betting, wagers at racetracks, and tax payments. 
6 Maximum Credit Limit: We will from time to time notify you of the maximum amount of credit which we will extend you under this Agreement. A portion of your credit limit, called the cash 

advance limit, will be available for cash advances. We may increase or decrease the credit limit or cash advance limit at anytime. The cash advance limit will be shown on your monthly statement. We will not be responsible for failing to extend credit to you under this Agreement. You agree not to allow the balance on your account to go over the maximum credit limit.  We will not extend credit if: 
� The extension of credit would cause the balance of your account to exceed your credit limit or if the balance of your account already exceeds your credit limit, or 
� Anything has happened that allows us to declare your account in default and therefore immediately due, or 
� Your Card has been canceled or suspended, or 
� Your Card has expired. If we do extend credit under any of the conditions above, it will be covered by the terms and provisions of this Agreement. We may delay extending credit if you have previously sent us a payment check or other negotiable instrument which has been returned as unpaid for any reason. 

7. Monthly Billing Statement: If you have a balance in your account, we will send you a monthly billing statement. It will show the total amountofyourPurchasesandCashAdvance Accounts,the ?nance charge, the minimum payment due, and the date the payment is due. 
8a. Finance Charge on Purchases �A ?nance charge will be imposed on each Purchase from the date the Purchase is posted to your account until the date it is paid in full, with the following exceptions: You may avoid ?nance charges on Purchases during any billing period if: (1) the opening balance on Purchases for that billing period was zero (0); or (2) the total of payments and credits posted during the billing period equals or exceeds the opening balance for that billing period. 
We calculate the Finance Charge on Purchases by applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your Purchase Account (including current transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your Purchases Account each day, add any new Purchases and subtract any payments or credits applied to Purchases that day, unpaid ?nance charges, late charges, overlimit fees and returned item fees. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the �average daily balance� which is shown on your statement as the Finance Charge Balance for Purchases. Finally, we multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate and the number of days in the billing period. 
The daily periodic rate and corresponding Annual Percentage Rate may vary (increase or decrease) quarterly based upon the movement in the highest prime rate as published by the Wall Street Journal on March 15th, June 15th, September 15th, and December 15th of each year (�index date�). If the Wall Street Journal is not 
published on any of these dates, the index will be the highest prime rate published on the ?rst publication date immediately following the index date. To obtain the Annual Percentage Rate we add 5.9% to the published index. To obtain the daily periodic rate we divide the Annual Percentage Rate by 365. A change in the daily periodic rate and corresponding Annual Percentage Rate resulting from a change in the index on the index dates stated above will be effective as of the billing date indicated on your April, July, October and January monthly billing statements respectively. An increase in the Annual Percentage Rate may result in an increase in the amount of your minimum payment. 
8b. Finance Charge on Cash Advances: A ?nance charge will be imposed on each Cash Advance from the day the Cash Advance is obtained until the date it is paid in full. We calculate the Finance Charge on Cash Advances by adding any Transaction Fee applied to new Cash Advances to the amount determined by applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your Cash Advance Account (including current transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your Cash Advance Account each day, add any new Cash Advances, and subtract any payments or credits applied to Cash Advances that day, unpaid ?nance charges, late charges, overlimit fees, transaction fees, and returned item fees. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the �average daily balance� which is shown on your statement as the Finance Charge Balance for Cash Advances. Finally, we multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate of .04904% (corresponding Annual Percentage Rate of 17.90%) and the number of days in the billing period. 
8c. Minimum Finance Charge : There will be a minimum ?nance charge of ?fty cents ($.50) for each billing period in which a ?nance charge is payable on your Purchases Account. 
8d. Cash Advance Transaction Fee: You will pay a transaction fee (?nance charge) each time you obtain a Cash Advance. The transaction fee will be 3% of the amount advanced but not less than $2.00 or more than $30.00. 

9. 	Returned Item Fee: We will charge you a returned item fee of $20.00 whenever your payment is returned to us for insuf?cient funds or any other reason. 

10. Late Charges:You pay a late charge of $25.00 any time a minimum payment remains unpaid for more than one billing period.  

11. Overlimit Fee: You will pay an overlimit fee of $20.00 if the principal balance of Purchases and Cash Advances exceeds your established credit limit on the closing date of your billing period. 

12. Payment: You promise to pay us all the amounts borrowed under this Agreement and any other amounts which you may owe us 

pursuant to this Agreement. 
At any time and without penalty, you may repay all or part of what you owe. You must, however, make at least the minimum payment each month. This minimum payment will be the total of: (1) the greater of [a] 1/60th of the outstanding principal Cash Advances and Purchases, or [b] $5.00, or the balance due, whatever is less; plus (2) currently calculated ?nance charges, cash advance transaction fees, other fees and charges incurred during the billing period, and insurance premium charges; plus (3) any minimum payment amount which is past due; plus (4) any amount in excess of your credit limit. 
Paying more than the minimum payment for your account for any billing period will not relieve you of the obligation to pay any further minimum payment for your account. 
13. PaymentAllocation:Your payment will be applied in the following order to any of these costs you owe: (1) collection costs, (2) fees and other card charges, (3) late charges, ?nance charges and insurance premiums in manner and order Credit Union elects, 
(4) unpaid principal balance of accrued Purchases and Cash Advances. 

14. Insurance: Credit life insurance and/or credit disability insurance may be made available to you by the Credit Union. Insurance coverage is not required by us as a condition for the extension of credit. If you should elect and qualify for the same, the coverage will be up to the minimum amount of credit extended to you. If you die, the insurance proceeds will be used to pay off your outstanding debt on the account. If you wish to have this coverage, you will give us a dated and signed written statement that you desire to obtain insurance coverage before we make it available. A certi?cate describing the coverage will be mailed to you 30 days after coverage begins. The premiums for this insurance will be due monthly and will be added to your minimum payment each billing period. 

15. Default: 	You will be in default if you fail to make a minimum payment when due. You will be in default if you break any promise you made under this Agreement, or under any other written agreement made in connection with use of the card. You will also be in default if you become insolvent, declare bankruptcy or die. When you are in default, the Credit Union may demand immediate payment of the entire amount you owe under this Agreement without giving you advance notice. 

Also, we may prohibit any further transactions on your Account, cancel the Cards, and revoke any privileges attaching to the Cards. You agree to surrender all Cards to us or our designee upon demand. If you default, we, at our option, may refuse to pay any of your convenience checks that are presented to us. If we decide to honor such checks, you will owe us the amount of such checks under the terms of this Agreement. 
16. No Notice or Loss of Rights: 	We do not have to notify you if any amount owing under this Agreement is not paid by the day it becomes due. We can do any of the following without notifying you or losing any right against you: 
� accept a check or money order marked �paid in full� or with similar language, as a payment under this Agreement, or 
� give additional time for payment of any amount owing under this Agreement, regardless of the length of any additional time we previously gave, or 
� exercise, give up, fail to exercise or delay exercising any right against any person. 


17. Collection Costs: If you are in default, you agree to pay actual costs of collection. This may include reasonable attorney fees not to exceed 20% of the amount due. 

18. Amendment: We can change the terms of this Agreement, including the ?nance charge, and the annual percentage rate, at any time. Except where limited by applicable law, the new terms will apply both to new purchases and cash advances and to the full outstanding balance of your account as of the day of the change.

In this Agreement, the words you, your and yours mean the undersigned Cardholder.  The words we, us and our mean LGE Community Credit Union.    We reserve the right to amend the terms and conditions of the Agreement from time to time. 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Illegal Transaction.  Your VISA Card may not be used for any illegal transaction.  Such use may subject you to criminal penalties, and will result in your VISA account privileges being terminated. 
Gambling.  GAMBLING TRANSACTIONS WILL NOT BE KNOWINGLY HONORED BY THE CREDIT UNION, and it shall be the Credit Union�s policy to attempt to �block� all such transactions.
Purchases and Cash Advances.  You can use the Card for Purchases and Cash Advances.  You will owe us for these amounts plus Finance Charges and Other Charges, if any, all payable in United States Dollars.  
Monthly Statement.   We will generate one monthly statement provided to you electronically or by mail at the address or email on file at the time the statement is generated.   A statement will generate if your account has activity, including debits, credits, Finance Charges or other charges during the Billing Cycle.  You must pay us (or if we elect, to any party to whom we transfer and assign your Account) according to the Terms and Conditions of the Account.  

Terms and Conditions (including Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure):
(a) The conditions under which a Finance Charge will be imposed:
Finance Charge - The cost of credit extended to you on the Account resulting from applying the Periodic Rate to the Average Daily Balance.  
(1) Purchases.  A Finance Charge will accrue from the date the transaction posts to the account during a Billing Cycle when there is a Previous Balance and it is not paid in full within the first 25 days of the Billing Cycle.  A Finance Charge that will accrue from the first day of the next Billing Cycle will be imposed on Purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the Closing Date.
(2) Cash Advances - Credit extended by us to you in the form of a loan made when you present the Card to us or to any financial institution honoring the Card, or use of any other credit instrument, device, overdraft coverage plan or automated teller machine we make available to you.  A Finance Charge computed on a Periodic Rate Basis will be imposed on Cash Advances from the date posted to the Account to the date paid.  The Finance Charge accrued on Cash Advances between the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle and the date your Account is credited will appear on your next statement.  There is no grace period within which to pay to avoid this Finance Charge. 

(3) If your Account is subject to a Finance Charge, then the more that you pay and the sooner you pay the less your Finance Charge will be.
(b) The method of determining the balance upon which a Finance Charge will be imposed:
(1) We calculate the Cash Advance Finance Charge on your Account by applying a Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of Cash Advances (rounded to the nearest penny), on your Account (including current transactions for Cash Advances).  To determine the �Average Daily Balance� of Cash Advances we begin with the previous day�s ending, Principal Cash Advance Balance (fees are not included).  To this balance, for each day in the billing period, we add new cash advances, new balance transfers, new convenience checks, and other debit transactions; then subtract any principal payments or other credit transactions.  The sum of the ending daily balances for the Billing Period is then divided by the number of days in the Billing Period.  The result is the �Average Daily Balance� of Cash Advances.  

(2) We calculate the Purchase Finance Charge on your Account by applying a Periodic Rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of Purchases (rounded to the nearest penny), on your Account (including current transactions for Purchases).  To determine the �Average Daily Balance� of Purchases we begin with the previous day�s ending, Principal Purchase Balance (fees are not included).  To this balance, for each day in the billing period, we add new Purchases and other debit transactions; then subtract any principal payments or other credit transactions.  The sum of the ending daily balances for the Billing Period is then divided by the number of days in the Billing Period.  The result is the �Average Daily Balance� of Purchases.  If the entire Previous Balance is paid in full within the first 25 days of the Billing Period, the Average Daily Balance of Purchases will be considered to be $0.
(c) The method of determining the amount of the FINANCE CHARGE:  The FINANCE CHARGE imposed during a Billing Cycle will be determined by:
(1) Multiplying the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances by the Monthly Periodic Rate for Cash Advances; the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is determined by multiplying the Monthly Periodic Rate by 12.
(2) Multiplying the Average Daily Balance of Purchases by the Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases; the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RAGE is determined by multiplying the Monthly Periodic Rate by 12.
(3) Adding the results of (1) and (2).
(4) The FINANCE CHARGE and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are determined by the application of a Variable Rate and may vary monthly:  The Monthly Periodic Rate will be determined monthly in advance of the Billing Cycle to which it will be applied, during the last week of the preceding month, in the following manner:  (a) We will determine the average of the 26-Week Treasury Bill (�T-Bill�) Rates for the preceding four weeks, (b) then we will add 12% percentage points to such T-Bill Rate, as announced, for Purchases, and 12% percentage points to such T-Bill Rate, as announced for Cash Advances; (c) We will then divide the resulting percentage by 12 to determine the Monthly Periodic Rate applicable to Cash Advances and Purchases for the next Billing Cycle.  If the Federal Reserve Bank should cease publishing the 26-Week T-Bill Rate, then we reserve the right to change the index or method of computing your interest.   If we do change the index, we will notify you.
(5) An increase/decrease in the 26-week T-Bill will cause a corresponding increase/decrease in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, and will increase/decrease the number of your payments of the same amount.  An increase/decrease in the T-Bill will take effect on the first day of the Billing Cycle.

(6)The Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases or Cash Advances will not exceed 1.5000% (corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 18%).
(7) Please see Attachment �A� for the current ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE.
(d) The conditions under which any Other Changes may be imposed:
(1) Late Payment Charge.  If you do not pay a Minimum Payment within 10 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle within which it is due, a Late Payment Charge will be imposed on your Account.  Please see Attachment �A� for current Late Payment Fee.

""Bill Me Later Payment System"" is the payment system which allows me to pay for Purchases from participating Merchants by charging the Costs to my Account. In this Agreement it may be called simply ""Bill Me Later.""
""Purchases"" are extensions of credit made on the Account to the Borrower, when the Borrower chooses the Bill Me Later Payment System to pay for a purchase from a Merchant.  For some purposes, including Borrower�s Billing Rights, Purchases may be considered to be credit card purchases.

""I"", ""me"" and ""Borrower"" mean the person who applied for this Account and agrees to this Agreement. 
""You"" means the Lender, and any person, company or bank to whom the rights of the Lender have been assigned.

""Merchant"" means a merchant participating in and authorized to accept the Bill Me Later payment option.
c. Parts of the Account. 
""Standard Purchases"" are subject to the standard repayment terms, Grace Period and Annual Percentage Rate, unless they are subject to an Extended Grace Period.� 
�Purchases subject to an Extended Grace Period� are Standard Purchases subject to special repayment terms and a special Grace Period; they are subject to the standard Annual Percentage Rate. The Extended Grace Period ends on the last day of the billing cycle in which the Expiration Date occurs.� The Extended Grace Period will end no earlier than 58 days after the transaction date, as disclosed when the transaction is made. No payments are due and no interest accrues during the Extended Grace Period. A Purchase subject to an Extended Grace Period, where the Expiration Date is 90 days after the transaction date, may be called a �Take 90. No Payments, No Interest for 90 days� Purchase or a �90 Days Extended Grace� Purchase (the number of days can vary, but will not be less than 58 days).� After its Extended Grace Period, a Purchase subject to an Extended Grace Period is a Standard Purchase and is not a Purchase subject to an Extended Grace Period. 
""Promotional Purchases"" may be subject to special, promotional repayment terms and/or Annual Percentage Rates for all or part of the time they are unpaid. Promotional Purchases are subject to the standard repayment terms and rate, except to the extent that the promotional offer states different terms.
�Deferred Interest Purchases� are Promotional Purchases on which no interest will be charged if they are paid in full within the deferred interest period.� Interest will be charged from the purchase date if the Purchase balance is not paid in full within the deferred interest period. The deferred interest period may be 6 months or more as disclosed when the transaction is made. 
�No payments for 6 months Purchases� are Deferred Interest Purchases on which no payments will be due during a 6 month deferred interest period.�

The Billing Cycle will end on any day that you or I Terminate the Account and I pay the balance in full.
""Closed-end Loan"" means a closed-end loan from the Lender to the Borrower, the proceeds of which were paid to a Merchant to pay the Cost of Borrower's purchase from the Merchant, using Bill Me Later, at a time when the Borrower did not have an active Account.

""Credit Line"" means the dollar amount of credit available for me to borrow on this Account.� The total balances of all parts of the Account plus transactions which have been authorized but not yet posted to the Account (but not including unpaid Fees) may not exceed the Credit Line.� You will treat any request for an extension of credit that would cause the balance to exceed the Credit Line as a request to increase the Credit Line.
""Expiration Date"" for a Deferred Interest Purchase is the date on which the deferred interest period ends; for a Purchase subject to an Extended Grace Period, it is a date at least 58 days (or other period) after the transaction date, as disclosed when the transaction is made.

I will make a Purchase using this Account by choosing the Bill Me Later Payment System when I make a purchase from a Merchant at a web site, by telephone, or at another authorized location.

You will charge interest on all parts of this Account, beginning on each transaction date, except during the Grace Period and as otherwise provided in the paragraph of this Agreement called ""Interest Rate and Interest Charges."" I will only have the right to use some parts of the Account from time to time, when you make a special offer. The rate of interest may be different for different parts of the Account.

a. Requesting an Account. I may request an Account in any of the ways you may provide.
b. Using Bill Me Later after I receive this Agreement. If I obtain a Closed-end Loan from you, you may send me information about Bill Me Later, including this Agreement. By using Bill Me Later after I receive this Agreement, I agree to this Agreement. 

4. HOW I CAN  USE THIS ACCOUNT. 
a. Standard and Promotional Purchases. I can make a Purchase using this Account by choosing the Bill Me Later Payment System when I make a purchase from a Merchant at a web site, by telephone, or at another authorized location. You will extend credit to me, in the amount of the Cost of the Purchase, by paying the Merchant on my behalf. These Purchases will be subject to the Standard Purchase terms, unless special terms are in effect at the time of the Purchase or are offered by the Merchant.
b. Refinance of Closed-end Loan. If I have any unpaid Closed-end Loans from you at the time I open this Account, I request that you refinance the Closed-end Loans by extending credit from this Account. If a Closed-end loan is subject to a Promotional rate or a Deferred Interest provision, the extension of credit will be from an equivalent Promotional or Deferred Interest part of the Account. If the Closed-end Loan is not subject to a Promotional rate or a Deferred Interest provision, the extension of credit will be from the Standard Purchases part of the Account.� 
c. Other Agreements about Purchases. 
(i) Credit Line. ��At the time I open my Account and obtain my first extension of credit, you will evaluate my request for credit.� Unless you notify me that my Credit Line is another amount (which could be higher or lower), my Credit Line will be the greater of: (A) the highest total of balances of all parts of the Account (but not including unpaid Fees) that was outstanding at any time (�highest balance�), or (B) $500 (�minimum Credit Line�).� 
For example: 
* If my first Purchase is for $150, my Credit Line will be $500 (the �minimum Credit Line�).  
* If my first Purchase is for $650, my Credit Line will be $650 (the �highest balance�). If I repay $300, I will have $300 credit available to borrow. 
If try to make a Purchase that would cause my outstanding balance to be above my Credit Line, you will treat that as a request to increase the Credit Line.� 
For example: 
* If my Credit Line is $650, I have a $200 balance, and I try to make a Purchase of $500, you will treat this as a request for an increase in the Credit Line. If you approve this transaction, my new Credit Line will be $700 (the �highest balance�). 
You have the option to refuse a request for an increase, but you will notify me of the reasons for any refusal.� You may occasionally and routinely verify credit information about me and obtain an updated consumer report in connection with this Account.� You may decrease my Credit Line at any time.� You will notify me at the time you do so.� 
(ii) You may charge my Account for Purchases. I authorize you to charge this Account for the Cost of any purchase I, or anyone to whom I have given permission to use this Account make from a Merchant using Bill Me Later. I understand that the amount that you actually pay to the Merchant may be less than the Cost, because the Merchant may agree that you may retain a portion of the Cost in order to participate in Bill Me Later.
(iii) You may charge my Account for Interest and Fees. I authorize you to charge this Account for interest, any Fees, costs of collection, and amounts that I agree in this Agreement to pay. 
5. MY PERSONAL INFORMATION. When I choose Bill Me Later to make a Purchase, I authorize the Merchant to share my personal information with you to the extent necessary for you to make a credit decision in order to open my Account or increase my Credit Line, and to complete my transaction, including verifying my identity, paying the Merchant on my behalf, charging my Account for the Costs of the purchase, sending me a billing statement, servicing my Account and for all other lawful purposes in connection with this Account. I authorize the Merchant to share my email address with you. I consent to your sending me emails for any lawful purpose in connection with this Account, including commercial emails for marketing Bill Me Later, its features, and the benefits of using Bill Me Later at Merchants who accept it. I may withdraw my consent to your sending me commercial emails, at any time, by changing my ""email preferences"" at the www.billmelater.com website,�or by ""unsubscribing"" when you send me an email. 

6. PROMISE TO PAY. Borrower promises to pay to you the balance on this Account, including all Purchases, extensions of credit and other amounts Borrower has authorized you to charge to this Account. Borrower promises to pay these amounts as agreed in this Agreement, including the promise to make the Minimum Payment Due each month on or before the Payment Due Date. 


7. BORROWER ALSO PROMISES:

a. To pay for all Purchases made by me and by someone I authorized to use this Account. You (and any person who may decide whether I am liable for amounts charged to this Account) may presume that I have authorized any Purchase made in my name using this Account, if the purchase is delivered in my name to my address, unless I return the purchase to the Merchant within a reasonable period of time. I will not be responsible for any unauthorized Purchases using this Account. 

b. To give you personal financial information about me that you may reasonably request, from time to time.

c. To pay all costs of collection if you take any action to collect this Account or take any action in a bankruptcy proceeding filed by or against me, if you are permitted by applicable law to charge those costs. This shall include, unless prohibited by applicable law, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses to the maximum amount permitted by applicable law.

d. Not to give you false information or signatures, electronic or otherwise, at any time.

e. To pay a Late Fee and Return Check Fee, as provided in this Agreement.

f. To make all payments by check, money order, electronic funds transfer or ACH in U.S. Dollars, drawn on funds on deposit with a U.S. financial institution or a U.S. branch of a foreign financial institution, in a form that will be processed and honored by your financial institution, in accordance with the reasonable requirements set forth on the billing statement, and to make each payment so that you receive it at the remittance address disclosed on the billing statement. If I make a non- conforming payment, you may refuse to accept the payment or, if you do accept it, I agree to pay your costs of processing the payment. A non-conforming payment, if accepted by you, will be credited to my Account not more than 5 days after the date you receive it, unless otherwise required by law. A non-conforming payment includes, among other things, a payment that is not made in accordance with this paragraph and with the reasonable requirements set forth on the billing statement, oversized and undersized instruments, instruments using non-standard materials, instruments in a non-standard format, and any non-standard instrument that requires special handling. 

g. That when I make a payment on this Account by check, I authorize you to use information from my check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from my account.� In certain circumstances, such as for technical or processing reasons, you may process my payment as a check transaction.� When you use information from my check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from my account as soon as the same day you receive my payment, and I understand that I will not receive my check back from my financial institution. I have the right to withdraw this authorization at any time by informing you that I do not want you to use the information from my checks to make an electronic fund transfer; to do so, I must contact you in writing at Electronic Check Opt Out, P.O. Box 4415, Timonium, MD 21094 and provide you with my name, Bill Me Later Account number and the name of the financial institution and account number from which my checks are drawn.
h. To promptly notify you if I change my name, my mailing address, my e-mail address or my telephone number.

i. To honor any other promises that I make in this Agreement.

j. That I will not accept this Account unless I am of legal age in the state where I reside and am a resident of the U.S.A.

k. If I am dissatisfied with goods or services I purchased from a merchant, I will try in good faith to resolve the dispute and correct the problem directly with the Merchant. I agree to allow a reasonable period of time for the Merchant to resolve the dispute. This shall in no way limit or reduce my rights in case of a billing error.

l. To use Bill Me Later only for personal, family or household purposes. 

8. SECURITY INTEREST. You will not take any security interest to secure this Account. 
9. INTEREST RATE AND INTEREST CHARGES. Except during the Grace Period, Borrower agrees to pay interest on the outstanding balance of each part of this Account, including billed interest and billed Fees, at all times that this Account is in effect, including any period after Termination in which there remains an outstanding balance. The interest will be calculated for each part of the Account separately, as of the last day in the Billing Cycle (the ""Statement Date""), in the following way: 
a. Parts of the Account. For the purposes of assessing interest, each part of the Account will be calculated separately. Parts may be called ""Transaction Types"" on the billing statements. 
(i) Standard Purchases. All Standard Purchases and any other balances that are moved to the Standard Purchases part of the Account will be a single part. At your option, Purchases subject to an Extended Grace Period may be treated as separate parts.�� 
(ii) Promotional Purchases. 

Promotional Purchases while subject to different Promotional rates, terms, and Deferred Interest terms will be different parts. 
* Deferred Interest Purchases. From time to time, you may offer Promotional Purchases with a Deferred Interest option. All Purchases subject to the same rate, Deferred Interest terms and Expiration Date will be a single part; at your option, you may consider any Deferred Interest Purchase to be a separate part, or may consider Deferred Interest Purchases from different Merchants to be different parts. If I pay the balance on the Deferred Interest part (which is called the ""Deferred Interest Balance"") in full by the Expiration Date, you will not charge any interest for that part. You will calculate the interest for each Billing Cycle prior to the Expiration Date and disclose it on the Billing Statement as the Accrued Deferred Interest. If I do not pay the balance on a Deferred Interest part of the Account before the Expiration Date, you may charge my Account, in the Billing Cycle in which the Expiration Date occurs, interest on each Promotional Purchase from the date of each Purchase (each ""transaction date""). 
* End of Promotional Terms. If a part is subject to a special promotional rate or Deferred Interest term which ends as of a certain date (�Expiration Date�), I authorize you to move, on or after that date, the balance remaining in that part to the Standard Purchases part of the Account, and it will be subject to the repayment and interest terms for Standard Purchases. � 
b. When the Interest begins. The interest begins to accrue on the transaction date, except (i) interest does not accrue on any portion of a Purchase that I repay during the Grace Period for the Purchase, if a Grace Period is applicable to the Purchase; (ii) interest does not accrue during the Extended Grace Period, if applicable to that Purchase, and (iii) interest will not be assessed if the conditions in the following paragraph are met.
c. Assessing Interest. You will not assess interest on Standard or Promotional Purchases during any Billing Cycle in which my payments and credits on or before the Payment Due Date reduce the outstanding balance for Standard and Promotional Purchases (excluding Standard and Promotional Purchases I made during the Billing Cycle, excluding Deferred Interest Purchases, and excluding Purchases subject to an Extended Grace Period) to zero or to a credit balance. This does not apply to a Deferred Interest Purchase. 
d. Grace Period.� Only Standard Purchases and Promotional Purchases (other than a Deferred Interest Purchase) are eligible for a Grace Period.� If a Purchase which is eligible for a Grace Period is made during a Billing Cycle in which no interest was assessed on the Purchase because of the preceding paragraph, you will not assess interest on any portion of the Purchase which I repay on or before the Payment Due Date in the next cycle.� You will not assess any interest on a Purchase that is subject to an Extended Grace Period before the last day of the Billing Cycle in which its Expiration Date occurs.� 
e. How you will determine the balance on which the interest is computed. You will compute the interest for each part on the ""Average Daily Balance"" (including new Purchases) for that part during the Billing Cycle. To get the Average Daily Balance for each part, you will take the beginning balance for each part each day and add any new Purchases and adjustments posted that day, including billed interest and billed Fees; then subtract any balances subject to an Extended Grace Period, any payments and any credits. This gives you the ""Daily Balance."" Then, you add up all the Daily Balances for the Billing Cycle for that part and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. The result is the Average Daily Balance for that part. You will treat any Average Daily Balance which is a credit balance as zero.� 
f. How you compute the Interest. You will compute the interest during the Billing Cycle for each part separately. For each part, you will multiply the Average Daily Balance for the Billing Cycle by the number of days in the Billing Cycle; then you will multiply the product by the Daily Periodic Rate in effect for that part during that Billing Cycle. The result is the interest for that part. You will then add up the interest for all the parts, to get the interest for the Account.
g. Minimum Interest Charge. If the Daily Balance of any part (excluding any balance on a Deferred Interest Purchase, prior to its Expiration Date, and any Purchase subject to an Extended Grace Period), on the last day of a Billing Cycle (the Statement Date), is greater than zero, and if the interest for the Billing Cycle is greater than zero but less than $2.00, you may assess a Minimum Interest Charge (which will be shown on the billing statement as a fee called a �Minimum Interest Charge�) of $2.00 for the Billing Cycle.
h. Rate of Interest. You will compute the interest on the Standard and Promotional Purchases parts using the Daily Periodic Rate of 0.05203%. This corresponds to the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 18.99%. However, if you have disclosed a special promotional rate at the time you made the special offer, according to law, you will compute the interest on the Promotional Purchases parts using that special promotional rate.
10. FEES. I agree to pay the following Fees, as applicable. I agree that you may allocate any Fee to the Standard Purchases part of the Account. 
a. Penalty Fees.
(i) Late Payment Fee. You will charge me a Late Fee for each month the Minimum Payment is not paid in full by its Payment Due Date. The amount of the Late Fee will be the amount of the missed payment, up to $25 the first time I am late. If my payment is late again within the next six billing cycles after any prior late payment, the amount of the Late Fee will be the amount of the missed payment, up to $35.  No Late Fee will be due if the reason the Payment is late is either: 
(A) attributable to a Late Fee assessed on an earlier payment; or
(B) because, after default, the entire balance on this Account is due. 
(ii) Return Check Fee. If my payment on this Account is made with a check, including a draft, order or other instrument that is returned by a drawee for ""not sufficient funds"" in the account on which the check is written, you will charge me a Fee equal to the amount of my payment, up to $25 for my first returned check. For subsequent returned checks in the next six billing cycles, the amount of the Fee will be the amount of my payment, up to $35. You will not charge the service charge, however, if you redeposit the check and it is paid. 
b. Fee for providing a copy of billing statement. Unless you are required by law to provide me with a copy of a billing statement for a Billing Cycle other than the current Billing Cycle, I agree to pay you a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) per billing statement if I request a copy. 
11. MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE. The Minimum Payment will be due each Billing Cycle, on or before the Payment Due Date. The amount of the Minimum Payment Due will be the sum of the current payment due for the Account plus any amounts past due from previous Billing Cycles.  The current payment due will be the greatest of (A) $35.00; or (B) 3% of the balances on the Account (excluding any balance on a no payments for 6 months (or 9 months or 12 months, as applicable) Purchase prior to� its Expiration Date, and excluding any balance subject to an Extended Grace Period), on the last day of the Billing Cycle; or (C) 1% of the balance on the Account (excluding any balance on a no payments for 6 months (or 9 months or 12 months, as applicable) Purchase prior to its Expiration Date , and excluding any balance subject to an Extended Grace Period), on the last day of the Billing Cycle plus any interest assessed on the Account in that billing cycle (excluding any accrued interest on a Deferred Interest Purchase that has been billed in that billing cycle), plus any Late Fees and Other Fees assessed on the Account in that billing cycle. The payment will be rounded down to the next whole dollar. 
12. PAYMENT APPLICATION. You will use each payment in the amount of the Minimum Payment Due or less, when I am not in default, first to pay billed interest, then billed Fees, then the principal balance (in any order you choose), and then any other amounts due. However, if I have a balance on a Deferred Interest Purchase, during the two Billing Cycles immediately preceding the Expiration Date, you may use the payment first to pay the balance on any Deferred Interest Purchases, (in any order you choose). � 
13. PREPAYMENT. If I pay an amount greater than the Minimum Payment Due in any Billing Cycle, the amount in excess of the Minimum Payment Due is a �prepayment.� A prepayment will not affect the way you calculate the amount of the next Minimum Payment, and I will nevertheless make the Minimum Payment the next Billing Cycle. I MAY MAKE PREPAYMENTS IN ANY AMOUNT AND MAY PAY THE ENTIRE BALANCE OR ANY PART OF IT AT ANY TIME PROVIDED THAT I PAY AT LEAST THE MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE IN EACH BILLING CYCLE WHEN IT IS DUE. If I make a prepayment, you will use the prepayment to pay the balances starting with the balance with the highest interest rate (in any order you choose), then the balances with the next highest interest rate (in any order you choose), and so forth. However, if I have a balance on a Deferred Interest Purchase, and I make a prepayment during the two Billing Cycles immediately preceding the Expiration Date, you will use the prepayment first to pay the balance on the Deferred Interest Purchase, starting with the balance subject to the highest interest rate. �
14. BILLING STATEMENTS AND CREDIT BALANCES. 
a. You will provide me with a billing statement for each Billing Cycle in which: 
(i) You impose interest to this Account; or
(ii) The New Balance is more than $1.00 (whether a credit or debit balance). 
(iii) I understand that you may provide me with electronic billing statements only and that I can elect to receive paper statements by logging in to www.billmelater.com. 
(iv) �I agree to notify you in writing of any errors in the billing statement within 60 days from the date it is provided. I agree to examine the billing statement and to notify you in writing, immediately, of any Purchases which were not made or authorized by me. You need not provide a billing statement to me if you deem this Account uncollectible or if delinquency collection proceedings have been started.
b. If the Account has a credit balance in excess of $1.00, you will refund the credit balance to me as required by law. I authorize you to make the refund elec",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

CARD AGREEMENT 


This Card Agreement is your contract with us. It governs 
the use of your card and account. The Supplemental Pricing 
Information (�Supplement�) is part of this Agreement. Please 
read this Agreement, including the Supplement, carefully. 
Keep both for your records. 

Definitions 

account means the relationship established between you and 
us by this Agreement. 

APR means an annual percentage rate. 

authorized user means any person you allow to use your 
account. 

card means one or more cards or other access devices that 
we give you to get credit under this Agreement. This includes 
account numbers. 

we, us, and our mean Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., the 
issuer of your account. 

you, your, and yours mean the person who applied to open 
the account. It also means any other person responsible for 
complying with this Agreement. 

Your Account 

You agree to use your account in accordance with this 
Agreement. You must pay us for all amounts due on your 
account. This Agreement is binding on you unless you close 
your account within 30 days after receiving the card and you 
have not used or authorized use of the card. Your account 
must only be used for lawful transactions. 

Authorized Users. You may request additional cards for 
authorized users. Each authorized user is your agent and may 
use, manage, and receive information about the account to 
the same extent as you, subject to any limitations we may 
impose. You must pay us for all charges made by authorized 
users. You must pay us even if you did not intend to be responsible 
for those charges. You must notify us to withdraw 
any permission you give to an authorized user to use your 
account. 

Joint Accounts. If this is a joint account, each of you is 
responsible individually and together for all amounts owed. 
Each of you is responsible even if the account is used by 
only one of you. You will continue to be liable for the entire 
balance of the account, even if your co-applicant is ordered 
by a court to pay us. You will remain liable to us if your co


applicant fails to pay as ordered by the court. Your account 
status will continue to be reported to the credit bureau under 
each of your names. The delivery of notices or billing statements 
to either of you serves as delivery to each of you. We 
may rely on instructions given by either of you. We are not 
liable to either of you for relying upon such instructions. 

Credit Limit. Your initial credit limit is on the card carrier. 
After that, your credit limit appears on your billing statement. 
The full amount of your credit limit is available to buy or 
lease eligible or qualified goods or services where the card is 
honored. We may reduce or increase your credit limit at any 
time for any reason, as permitted by law. We will notify you 
of any change, but the change may take effect before you 
receive the notice. You should always keep your total balance 
below the credit limit. However, if the total balance goes over 
your credit limit you still must pay us. If your account has 
a credit balance, we may reduce the credit balance by any 
new charges on your account. You may not maintain a credit 
balance in excess of your credit limit. 

Billing Statement. Your billing statement shows the New 
Balance. This is the total amount you owe us on the Statement 
Closing Date. To determine the New Balance, we begin 
with the total balance at the start of the billing cycle. We add 
any purchases. We subtract any credits or payments. We then 
add any interest charges or fees and make other adjustments. 

Your billing statement also shows your transactions; the 
Minimum Payment Due and payment due date; your credit 
limit; and your interest charges and fees. 

We deliver a billing statement to only one address. You must 
notify Customer Service of a change in address. We may stop 
sending you statements if we deem your account uncollectible 
or start collection proceedings; but we may continue to 
add interest and fees as permitted by law. 

APRs 

Variable APRs Based on Prime. See the Supplement for 
information about the APRs that apply to your account. 
If any APR is based on the U.S. Prime Rate (�Prime Rate�), 
the APR will equal the Prime Rate plus an additional amount. 
The additional amount appears on the Supplement. If the 
Prime Rate increases, it will cause the APR to increase. If 
the Prime Rate decreases, it will cause the APR to decrease. 
For each billing cycle we use the Prime Rate published in 
The Wall Street Journal two business days before the 
Statement Closing Date. If the Prime Rate causes an APR 
to change, we put the new APR into effect as of the first 
day of the billing cycle for which we calculate the APR. We 

apply the new APR to any existing balances, subject to any 
promotional rate that may apply. If The Wall Street Journal 
does not publish the Prime Rate, we will use a similar published 
rate. 

Effect of APR Increases. If an APR increases, interest 
charges increase. Your minimum payment may increase 
as well. 

Promotions 

We may offer promotional terms for all or a part of any 
balances. Any promotional terms may apply for a limited 
period of time. They will be governed by the terms of the 
promotional offer and this Agreement. Your promotional 
terms will end when the promotional period expires or, to 
the extent permitted by law, if you make a late payment. 
The promotional offer will tell you if we require a separate 
minimum payment on the promotional balance. 

If a promotional offer is a deferred interest offer, no interest 
charges will be imposed on the deferred interest balance 
if you pay the balance in full by the end of the promotional 
period for that deferred interest balance. We will impose 
interest charges on the deferred interest balance at the APR 
for regular purchases from the date of purchase if you do not 
pay the balance in full by the end of the promotional period. 

Interest Charges Based on APRs 
Interest Charges. We impose interest charges when we 
apply APRs to your account balances. We do this every day 
by using a daily periodic rate. To get a daily periodic rate, 
we divide the APR by 365. 

When Interest Charges Begin. We begin to impose interest 
charges the first day we add a charge to a daily balance. The 
charges we add to a daily balance include purchases, interest 
charges and fees. We continue to impose interest charges 
until we credit your account with full payment of the total 
amount you owe us. 

Grace Period on Purchases. You can avoid interest charges 
on purchases. This is called a grace period on purchases. 
The grace period is at least 25 days. To get a grace period on 
purchases, you must pay the New Balance by the payment 
due date every billing cycle. If you do not, you will not get a 
grace period until you pay the New Balance for two billing 
cycles in a row. 

If you have a balance subject to a deferred interest promotion 
and that promotion does not expire before the payment due 
date, that balance (the �excluded promotional balance�) is 
excluded from the amount you must pay in full to get a grace 


period. However, you must still pay any separately required 
payment on the excluded promotional balance. In billing 
cycles in which payments are allocated to deferred interest 
balances first, the deferred interest balance will be reduced 
before any other balance on the account. However, you will 
continue to get a grace period on purchases so long as you 
pay the New Balance less any excluded promotional balances 
in full by the payment due date each billing cycle. 

In addition, certain promotional offers may take away the 
grace period on purchases. Other promotional offers not 
described above may also allow you to have a grace period 
on purchases without having to pay all or a portion of the 
promotional balance by the payment due date. If either is the 
case, the promotional offer will describe what happens. 

Calculation of Interest Charges � Daily Balance Method 
(Including Current Transactions). We calculate interest 
charges each billing cycle. To do this: 

� We start with each of your different balances. These 
balances include, for example, regular purchases, Old 
Balances, and different promotional balances. (When we 
calculate interest charges, we treat each deferred interest 
transaction separately even if it has the same terms as 
another deferred interest transaction.) 
� We calculate the daily balance for each of your different 
balances. To get a daily balance, we start with the 
balance as of the end of the previous day. We add any 
interest charge on the previous day�s balance. (This 
results in daily compounding of interest charges.) We 
add any new charges. We then subtract any new credits 
or payments. 
� We multiply each daily balance by the daily periodic rate 
that applies to it. We do this for each day in the billing 
cycle. This gives us the daily interest charges for each 
of your different balances. 
� We add up all the daily interest charges. The sum is the 
total interest charge for the billing cycle. 
� You authorize us to round interest charges to the nearest 
cent. 
When we calculate daily balances, we add a purchase as of 
the Transaction Date. The Transaction Date is on the billing 
statement. We add a transaction fee to the same balance as 
the transaction. We generally add other fees, including credit 
protection fees and insurance charges, to the regular purchase 
balance. We subtract a payment or credit as of the day 
it is credited to the account and then make other adjustments. 
We treat a credit balance as a balance of zero. 

Minimum Interest Charge. If we charge you interest, the 
charge will be no less than $2. We add the charge to the 
regular purchase balance or allocate it among one or more 
of the balances that accrues interest. 

Balance Subject to Interest Rate. Your statement shows 
a Balance Subject to Interest Rate. It shows this for each 
different balance. The Balance Subject to Interest Rate is the 
average of the daily balances during the billing cycle. A billing 
cycle begins on the day after the Statement Closing Date of 
the previous billing cycle. It includes the Statement Closing 
Date of the current billing cycle. 

Fees 

Late Fee. We may add a late fee for each billing cycle in 
which you have a past due payment. For late fee purposes, 
you have a past due payment any time you fail to pay the 
Minimum Payment Due by the payment due date. The fee will 
be $25; or $35 for any additional past due payment during 
the next six billing cycles after a past due payment. However, 
the fee will not exceed the amount permitted by law. We add 
this fee to the regular purchase balance. 

Returned Payment Fee. We may add a returned payment fee 
for a returned payment. A returned payment is an electronic 
debit, payment check, or similar payment instrument, that 
is returned unpaid. We may add this fee the first time 
your payment is returned, even if it is not returned upon 
resubmission. The fee will be $25; or $35 for any additional 
returned payment during the next six billing cycles after 
a returned payment. However, the fee will not exceed the 
amount permitted by law. We add this fee to the regular 
purchase balance. 

Information on Foreign Currency Conversion 
If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, Sears or one 
of its affiliates converts the amount into U.S. dollars. Sears 
and its affiliates follow their own foreign currency conversion 
procedures to do so. These may change from time to time 
without notice. Currently, Sears and its affiliates use a 
conversion rate in effect on the date of conversion. This rate 
is either a retail market rate or the government-mandated 
rate. The conversion rate you get is the one used on the 
transaction�s processing date. This may be different from 
the one in effect on the Transaction Date or post date for the 
transaction. 

Payments 
Minimum Payment Due. You must pay at least the Minimum 
Payment Due by the payment due date each billing cycle. The 

sooner you pay the New Balance, the less you will pay in 
interest charges. 

To calculate the Minimum Payment Due, we begin with 
any past due amount. We then add any additional amount 
specified in a promotional offer. We also add the largest of 
the following: 

� The Calculated New Balance if it is less than $25; 
� $25 if the Calculated New Balance is at least $25; 
� 1% of the Calculated New Balance (the result is rounded 
up to the nearest dollar) plus the amount of your billed 
interest charges on that balance, any minimum interest 
charge allocated to that balance, and any applicable late 
fee. However, we subtract interest charges that accrued 
during prior billing cycles on a deferred interest balance 
that ended during the billing cycle covered by the statement; 
or 
� 1.5% of the Calculated New Balance (the result is 
rounded up to the nearest dollar). 
The Calculated New Balance equals the New Balance on the 
billing statement less any balances subject to either of two 
types of promotional terms. The first type are terms that do 
not require a minimum payment. The second type are terms 
that require an additional amount as part of the Minimum 
Payment Due. The Minimum Payment Due may reflect 
adjustments to the New Balance and is never more than the 
Calculated New Balance plus any additional amount required 
by a promotional offer. 

Application of Payments. Payments in excess of the 
Minimum Payment Due are applied in accordance with 
law. This means that we will generally apply payments in 
excess of the Minimum Payment Due to higher APR balances 
first. However, excess payments received before a deferred 
interest promotion expires are applied to the deferred interest 
promotional balance first in the last two billing cycles of the 
promotional period. And, if the expiration date of a deferred 
interest promotion is before the payment due date in the 
billing cycle in which the deferred interest promotion expires, 
excess payments received before the deferred interest 
promotion expires are applied to the deferred interest 
promotional balance first in the last three billing cycles of 
the promotional period. Payments equal to or less than 
the Minimum Payment Due and credits are applied at our 
discretion and you authorize us to apply payments and credits 
in a way that is most favorable or convenient for us. This 
may include applying such payments and credits to lower 
APR balances first and to balances with longer promotional 
periods first. 


Payment Instructions. We credit your payments in accordance 
with our payment instructions on the billing statement. 
You must pay us in U.S. dollars. To do so, you must use a 
check, similar instrument, or electronic debit that is drawn on 
and honored by a bank in the U.S. Do not send cash. We can 
accept late or partial payments, or payments that reflect �paid 
in full� or other restrictive endorsements, without losing our 
rights. We also reserve the right to accept payments made in 
foreign currency and instruments drawn on funds on deposit 
outside the U.S. If we do, we select the currency conversion 
rate. We will then credit your account in U.S. dollars after 
deducting any costs incurred in processing your payment. 
Or we may bill you separately for these costs. 

Optional Pay by Phone Service. You may use our optional 
Pay by Phone Service to make your payment by phone. To do 
so, call us to request the service. You agree to pay us the Pay 
by Phone fee shown in the Pay by Phone section on the back 
of the billing statement when a representative of ours helps 
expedite your payment. Our representatives are trained to tell 
you this amount when you use this service. 

Credit Reporting 
We may report information about your account to credit 
bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults 
on your account may be reflected in your credit report. We 
may report account information in your name and the names 
of authorized users. We may also obtain follow-up credit 
reports on you. 

If you think we reported incorrect information to a credit 
bureau, write us at the Customer Service address on the billing 
statement. We will investigate the matter. We will then tell you 
if we agree or disagree with you. If we agree with you, we will 
contact each credit bureau to which we reported and request 
a correction. If we disagree with you, we will tell you that. 

Information Sharing 
You authorize us to share information about you as permitted 
by law. This includes information we get from you and others. 
It also includes information about your transactions with us. 
Please see our Privacy Notice for details about our information 
sharing practices. 

Changes to this Agreement 
We may change the rates, fees, and terms of this Agreement 
from time to time as permitted by law. The changes 
may add, replace, or remove provisions of this Agreement. 
We will give you advance written notice of the changes and 
a right to opt out to the extent required by law. 

Default 

You default under this Agreement if you fail to pay the 
Minimum Payment Due by its due date; go over your credit 
limit; pay by a check or similar instrument that is not honored 
or that we must return because it cannot be processed; pay 
by electronic debit that is returned unpaid; file for bankruptcy; 
or fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If you 
default, we may close your account and, to the extent permitted 
by law, demand immediate payment of the total balance. 

Refusal of the Card, Closed Accounts, 
and Related Provisions 

Refusal of the Card. We do not guarantee approval of 
transactions. We are not liable for transactions that are not 
approved. That is true even if you have enough credit. We 
may limit the number of transactions approved in one day. 
If we detect unusual or suspicious activity, we may suspend 
your credit privileges. 

Preauthorized Charges. We may suspend any automatic or 
other preauthorized card charges you arrange with a third 
party. We may do this if you default; if the card is lost or 
stolen; or we change your account for any reason. If we do 
this, you are responsible for paying the third party directly if 
you wish to do so. You are also responsible for reinstating 
the preauthorized charges if you wish to do so and we 
permit it. 

Lost or Stolen Cards or Account Numbers. You must call us 
if any card or account number is lost or stolen. You must also 
call us if you think someone used or may use them without 
permission. When you call, we may require you to provide 
information to help our investigation. We may require you to 
provide this information in writing. For example, we may ask 
you to identify any charges that were not made by you or 
someone authorized by you. We may also ask you to confirm 
that you received no benefit from those charges. 

Closing Your Account. You may close your account by 
notifying us in writing or over the phone. If you close your 
account, you must still repay the total balance in accordance 
with this Agreement. We may also close your account or 
suspend account privileges at any time for any reason. We 
may do this without prior notice to you. We may also reissue 
a different card at any time. You must return any card to us 
upon request. 

ARBITRATION 
PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT 
CAREFULLY. IT PROVIDES THAT ANY DISPUTE MAY BE 

RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION 
REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING 
THE RIGHT TO A JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE 
IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. IN ARBITRATION, 
A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR 
INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES 
ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN COURT 
PROCEDURES. 

Agreement to Arbitrate: Either you or we may, without the 
other�s consent, elect mandatory, binding arbitration for any 
claim, dispute, or controversy between you and us (called 
�Claims�). 

Claims Covered 

What Claims are subject to arbitration? All Claims relating 
to your account, a prior related account, or our relationship 
are subject to arbitration, including Claims regarding the 
application, enforceability, or interpretation of this Agreement 
and this arbitration provision. All Claims are subject to arbitration, 
no matter what legal theory they are based on or what 
remedy (damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief) they 
seek. This includes Claims based on contract, tort (including 
intentional tort), fraud, agency, your or our negligence, 
statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other sources of 
law; Claims made as counterclaims, cross-claims, third-
party claims, interpleaders or otherwise; and Claims made 
independently or with other claims. A party who initiates 
a proceeding in court may elect arbitration with respect to 
any Claim advanced in that proceeding by any other party. 
Claims and remedies sought as part of a class action, private 
attorney general or other representative action are subject to 
arbitration on an individual (non-class, non-representative) 
basis, and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual 
(non-class, non-representative) basis. 

Whose Claims are subject to arbitration? Not only ours and 
yours, but also Claims made by or against anyone connected 
with us or you or claiming through us or you, such as a 
co-applicant or authorized user of your account, an employee, 
agent, representative, affiliated company, predecessor or 
successor, heir, assignee, or trustee in bankruptcy. 

What time frame applies to Claims subject to arbitration? 

Claims arising in the past, present, or future, including Claims 
arising before the opening of your account, are subject to 
arbitration. 

Broadest interpretation. Any questions about whether Claims 
are subject to arbitration shall be resolved by interpreting this 
arbitration provision in the broadest way the law will allow it 


to be enforced. This arbitration provision is governed by the 
Federal Arbitration Act (the �FAA�). 

What about Claims filed in Small Claims Court? Claims filed 
in a small claims court are not subject to arbitration, so long 
as the matter remains in such court and advances only an 
individual (non-class, non-representative) Claim. 

What about debt collections? We and anyone to whom we 
assign your debt will not initiate an arbitration proceeding to 
collect a debt from you unless you assert a Claim against us 
or our assignee. We and any assignee may seek arbitration 
on an individual basis of any Claim asserted by you, whether 
in arbitration or any proceeding, including in a proceeding to 
collect a debt. You may seek arbitration on an individual basis 
of any Claim asserted against you, including in a proceeding 
to collect a debt. 

How Arbitration Works 

How does a party initiate arbitration? The party filing an 
arbitration must choose one of the following two arbitration 
firms and follow its rules and procedures for initiating and 
pursuing an arbitration: American Arbitration Association or 
JAMS. Any arbitration hearing that you attend will be held 
at a place chosen by the arbitration firm in the same city as 
the U.S. District Court closest to your then current billing 
address, or at some other place to which you and we agree in 
writing. You may obtain copies of the current rules of each of 
the arbitration firms and forms and instructions for initiating 
an arbitration by contacting them as follows: 

American Arbitration Association 
800-778-7879 (toll-free) 
Website: www.adr.org 


JAMS 
800-352-5267 (toll-free) 
Website: www.jamsadr.com 


At any time you or we may ask an appropriate court to 
compel arbitration of Claims, or to stay the litigation of Claims 
pending arbitration, even if such Claims are part of a lawsuit, 
unless a trial has begun or a final judgment has been entered. 
Even if a party fails to exercise these rights at any particular 
time, or in connection with any particular Claims, that party 
can still require arbitration at a later time or in connection 
with any other Claims. 

What procedures and law are applicable in arbitration? 

A single, neutral arbitrator will resolve Claims. The arbitrator 
will be either a lawyer with at least ten years experience or a 
retired or former judge, selected in accordance with the rules 

of the arbitration firm. The arbitration will follow procedures 
and rules of the arbitration firm in effect on the date the 
arbitration is filed unless those procedures and rules are 
inconsistent with this Agreement, in which case this Agreement 
will prevail. Those procedures and rules may limit the 
discovery available to you or us. The arbitrator will take 
reasonable steps to protect customer account information 
and other confidential information if requested to do so by 
you or us. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law 
consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, 
will honor claims of privilege recognized at law, and will have 
the power to award to a party any damages or other relief 
provided for under applicable law. You or we may choose to 
have a hearing and be represented by counsel. The arbitrator 
will make any award in writing and, if requested by you or us, 
will provide a brief statement of the reasons for the award. An 
award in arbitration shall determine the rights and obligations 
between the named parties only, and only in respect of the 
Claims in arbitration, and shall not have any bearing on the 
rights and obligations of any other person, or on the 
resolution of any other dispute. 

Who pays? Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing 
fee. If we file, we pay; if you file, you pay, unless you get a 
fee waiver under the applicable rules of the arbitration firm. 
If you have paid the initial filing fee and you prevail, we will 
reimburse you for that fee. If there is a hearing, we will pay 
any fees of the arbitrator and arbitration firm for the first day 
of that hearing. All other fees will be allocated as provided by 
the rules of the arbitration firm and applicable law. However, 
we will advance or reimburse your fees if the arbitration firm 
or arbitrator determines there is good reason for requiring 
us to do so, or if you ask us and we determine there is good 
reason for doing so. Each party will bear the expense of that 
party�s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, 
regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover 
any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, 
applying applicable law, so determines. 

Who can be a party? Claims must be brought in the name 
of an individual person or entity and must proceed on an 
individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitrator 
will not award relief for or against anyone who is not a 
party. If you or we require arbitration of a Claim, neither you, 
we, nor any other person may pursue the Claim in arbitration 
as a class action, private attorney general action or other 
representative action, nor may such Claim be pursued on 
your or our behalf in any litigation in any court. Claims, 
including assigned Claims, of two or more persons may not 

be joined or consolidated in the same arbitration. However, 
applicants, co-applicants, authorized users on a single 
account and/or related accounts, or corporate affiliates are 
here considered as one person. 

When is an arbitration award final? The arbitrator�s award 
is final and binding on the parties unless a party appeals it in 
writing to the arbitration firm within fifteen days of notice of 
the award. The appeal must request a new arbitration before 
a panel of three neutral arbitrators designated by the same 
arbitration firm. The panel will consider all factual and legal 
issues anew, follow the same rules that apply to a proceeding 
using a single arbitrator, and make decisions based on the 
vote of the majority. Costs will be allocated in the same way 
they are allocated for arbitration before a single arbitrator. 
An award by a panel is final and binding on the parties after 
fifteen days has passed. A final and binding award is subject 
to judicial review and enforcement as provided by the FAA or 
other applicable law. 

Survival and Severability of Terms 
This arbitration provision shall survive: (i) termination or 
changes in the Agreement, the account, or the relationship 
between you and us concerning the account; (ii) the bankruptcy 
of any party; and (iii) any transfer, sale or assignment 
of your account, or any amounts owed on your account, to 
any other person or entity. If any portion of this arbitration 
provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the entire 
arbitration provision shall not remain in force. No portion of 
this arbitration provision may be amended, severed or waived 
absent a written agreement between you and us. 

Governing Law and Enforcing our Rights 

Governing Law. Federal law and the law of South Dakota, 
where we are located, govern the terms and enforcement of 
this Agreement. 

Enforcing this Agreement. We will not lose our rights under 
this Agreement because we delay in enforcing them or fail to 
enforce them. 

Collection Costs. To the extent permitted by law, you are 
liable to us for our legal costs if we refer collection of your 
account to a lawyer who is not our salaried employee. These 
costs may include reasonable attorneys� fees. They may also 
include costs and expenses of any legal action. 

Assignment. We may assign any or all of our rights and 
obligations under this Agreement to a third party.

DELTA COMMUNITY PLANTINUM REWARDS VISA
CONSUMER CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT In this Agreement, �Agreement� means this Consumer Credit Card Agreement. �Disclosure� means the Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement.
1.	USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor.
You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. 
2.	USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery tickets, and casino gaming chips, as applicable. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal.
3.	PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account.
4.	PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement. 
5.	FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later.
The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 
For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To get the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. Then, we add all the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances.
6.	FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date.
A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates.
7.	FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
a.	Cash Advance Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Cash Advance Fee (finance charge), the fee may be charged for ATM withdrawals and transfers made from your card to any deposit account through Online Banking and Audio Line.  Overdraft transfers are excluded.  A cash advance fee may be initially charged for balance transfers initiated to pay off non-Delta Community Credit Union accounts but will be credited back to your Visa account. 
b.	Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency. 
c.	Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
d.	Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when a payment is returned to you for any reason.
e.	Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the credit union, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request.
f.	Document Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Document Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request (except when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union).
g.	Rush Fee. If your account is subject to a Rush Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each rush card that you request, providing delivery of the card is also available by standard mail service, without paying a fee for delivery.
h.	Stop Payment Fee. If your account is subject to the Stop Payment Fee, a fee will be charged to your account as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
i.	Visa Convenience Checks Fee. If your account is subject to the Visa Convenience Checks Fee, a fee will be charged to your account as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
j.	Over-the-Credit Limit Fee. If you have elected the feature to allow your account to go over your credit limit, we may charge you a fee as allowed by law. However, in no case will we impose an over-the-limit fee except in the next two billing cycles unless you have obtained an additional extension of credit in excess of such credit limit during each subsequent cycle or you have reduced the balance below the credit limit as of the end of each bill cycle.
8.	PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 3.00% of your total new balance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, and any amount you are over your credit limit. In addition to the minimum payment, you must also pay, by the date specified above, the amount of any prior minimum payment(s) that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. 
9.	PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate. 
10.	SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. 
Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default.
Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement. 
11.	DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe.
When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe.

You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized.

Delta Community Credit Union
1025 Virginia Ave
Atlanta, GA 30354-1319
You may also contact us on the Web: www.deltacommunitycu.com
In your letter, give us the following information:
* Account information: Your name and account number.
* Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
* Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us:
* Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
* At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
	1.	Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
	2.	Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. 
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
* We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
* The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
* While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
* We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
* If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
* If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. 
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.

Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
	1.	The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
	2.	You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
	3.	You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing [or electronically] at:
Delta Community Credit Union
1025 Virginia Ave
Atlanta, GA 30354-1319
www.deltacommunitycu.com
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

KEMBA FINANCIAL CREDIT UNION MASTERCARD PLATINUM TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND BILLING RIGHTS NOTICE RETAIL INSTALLMENT CREDIT AGREEMENT
I. MASTERCARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
These Terms and Conditions and Notice (�Agreement�), the card carrier we send with your Card, any documents accompanying your Card, and the application you signed or otherwise submitted govern the use of your MasterCard credit card account (�Account�). The card carrier, accompanying documents, and application are part of and incorporated into this Agreement. The word Card means a single MasterCard card or two or more MasterCard cards and any renewal or substitutes issued for the Card. The words you, yours, and Holder mean the applicant(s) and anyone else the applicant(s) permits to use the Card. The words we, us, our, and Issuer mean KEMBA Financial Credit Union, and its successors or assignees. 
1. Use of Card. You can use your Card to buy or lease goods and obtain services or insurance (�Purchases�) wherever the Card is honored and to get instant cash loans (�Cash Advances�) from any financial institution that accepts the Card. You will owe us for all Purchases and Cash Advances charged by the use of the Card, plus any other charges (�Debits�) to your Account made under the terms of this Agreement, plus any finance charges, all payable in U.S. dollars and as required by this Agreement. The Card shall remain the property of Issuer, who may at any time revoke its use and demand its immediate surrender pursuant to Section 18 of this Agreement. You agree not to use your Card for any transaction that may be illegal, or any transaction in connection with Internet gambling. 
2. Term of Account.  Fixed rate accounts have a term of two (2) years.  At the end of the term, your account will be reviewed and may be renewed.  If your account is not renewed, you may pay off any balances according to the original terms of your account.  If your account is renewed, any existing balances will be subject to the rates and terms of the new account.
3. Balance Transfers. You may use your Card or Account to transfer balances from other credit card accounts to this Account (�Balance Transfers�) by means (including balance transfer forms) we may make available from time to time. You may not transfer balances from any other account you have with us. 
4. Credit Line. Your Credit Line is listed on Page 1 of your Account Details Disclosure. Your Credit Line may be changed from time to time and your current Credit Line will be listed on your monthly billing statement. We will not authorize Purchases, Balance Transfers, or Cash Advances that cause your account to exceed your Credit Line. 
5. Statements and Payments. If you have a balance or activity on your Account, we will send you a monthly statement that will show, separately, your Purchases/Debits Account, your Cash Advance Account, Balance Transfers Account, finance charges to your Account, the minimum payment due, and the date the payment is due. You can pay all of your outstanding balance on your Card at any time, but you must make at least a minimum payment of 2.5% of your Account balance or $25 (whichever is greater) plus any amount in excess of your Credit Line and any past due amount, within 21 days of the date of each monthly statement. You agree to mail your payments to the address shown on your statement. You will be charged a late charge if a minimum payment is not made before the 29th day of any calendar month in which a payment is due. This late charge will be $15 if your Account balance is $250 or less, and $25 if your Account balance exceeds $250. If more than one (1) minimum payment is late in a six month period, an additional $10 will be added to the late charge.  In this case the late charge will be $25 if your Account balance is $250 or less, and $35 if your Account balance exceeds $250. In no case will the late charge exceed your minimum payment.  If any check or any instrument given for payment on the Account is dishonored for any reason, a return payment fee in the amount of $10 will be imposed. Payments received in excess of your minimum payment amount on your Account will be applied to the balances with the highest APR unless the balance is part of a promotional offer where no interest is being charged. 
6. FINANCE CHARGES on Purchases/Debits. If you pay your entire balance for Purchases/Debits within 21 days of the date of the first statement showing such charges and any previous balances, no finance charges are incurred for such Purchases/Debits. If that balance is not paid in full within the required time, a finance charge will be added to your Purchases/Debits from the first day of the billing cycle following the purchase date until they are paid in full, calculated this way: We take the beginning balance of your Purchases/Debits each day, and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid finance charges attributable to the balance for Purchases/Debits. That gives us the daily balance for your Purchases/Debits. We then add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. We multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate times the number of days in the billing cycle. 
7. FINANCE CHARGES on Cash Advances. You will pay a FINANCE CHARGE on Cash Advances from the date the advance is made until the advance is paid in full, computed as follows: We take the beginning balance of your Cash Advances each day, add any new Cash Advances charged on that day, and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid finance charges attributable to the balance for Cash Advances. That gives us the daily balance for your Cash Advances. We then add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. We multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate times the number of days in the billing cycle. 
8. FINANCE CHARGES on Balance Transfers. You will pay a FINANCE CHARGE on Balance Transfers from the date the transfer is made until the Balance Transfer amount is paid in full, computed as follows: We take the beginning balance of your Balance Transfers each day, add any new Balance Transfers charged on that day, and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid finance charges attributable to the balance for Balance Transfers. That gives us the daily balance for your Balance Transfers. We then add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. We multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate times the number of days in the billing cycle. 
9. Transaction Fee FINANCE CHARGE on Cash Advances. You will pay a Cash Advance fee FINANCE CHARGE for each cash advance equal to 3.00% of the amount advanced, but in no event will the cash advance fee be less than $5. 
10. Periodic Rate for Purchases (Standard APR). The daily periodic rates of your account ranges from 0.035589% to 0.052027% and corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) range from 12.99% to 18.99%.
11. Periodic Rate for Cash Advances. The daily periodic rate for Cash Advances for each billing cycle will be the Standard APR plus 4% divided by 365, but in no event will the Cash Advance APR exceed 25%. Your periodic rates for Cash Advances range from 0.046548% to 0.062986%.
12. Periodic Rate for Balance Transfers. The daily periodic rate for Balance Transfers for each billing cycle will be the Standard APR divided by 365. Your periodic rate for Balance Transfers is listed on 
Page 1 of your Account Details Disclosure. 
13. Interest Rate. Your initial interest rate is found on Page 1 of your Account Details Disclosure. 
14. Delinquency Rate. If your minimum payment is 60 days or more late a higher daily periodic rate (""Delinquency Rate"") may apply to the existing balance on your Account and to all new Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance Transfers beginning with the first day of the next billing period. The daily periodic Delinquency Rate for a billing period is 0.060247% (21.99% APR).  This Delinquency Rate will remain in effect until you have made six (6) consecutive payments on time.  When you have made six (6) consecutive payments on time, the rate will revert to your Standard Rate.
15. Annual Fee. None 
16. Default. You will be in default and we can demand immediate payment of the full balance due on your Account and cancel your Card if you do not pay an installment on time, die, file bankruptcy, become insolvent, exceed your Credit Line without permission or have given us false or incomplete information when you applied for your Card. Following your default, we will have all rights the law allows, including the right to cancel your Account and to accelerate payment of all amounts owing on your Account (that is, we may declare all amounts owing on your Account to be due and payable immediately or according to such accelerated payment schedule as we require). Unless required by law, we may take any of these actions without notice to you. If we have to refer collection of the Account to an attorney or have to determine the non-dischargeability of the debt in bankruptcy court, you will be responsible for our reasonable attorneys� fees and any court costs, if allowed by law. If we accelerate payment of your Account, the unpaid principal balance of your Account will bear interest until it is paid in full at a fixed rate equal to the annual percentage rate in effect on the date of acceleration. 
17. Security Agreement. You agree, as a condition of this Account, to grant us a security interest in all of your rights, title and interest in any and all amounts you have on deposit in accounts with us or shares on deposit with us or any dividends due you from us, unless prohibited by applicable law. This security interest is given to us as security for the payment and performance of all obligations and indebtedness now or hereafter owing by you to us under your Account.

If you have a copy of the report that includes the inaccurate information, please send a copy of the report to us as well.

Subject to the limitations of applicable law, we may at any time change, add to, or delete any of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, finance charge rates and fees and this Changes in Terms provision. Such changes may be based, in whole or in part, upon factors including, but not limited to, anti-fraud policies and procedures, your record of making timely payments and staying within the established Credit Line on your Account with us, your credit score, and information contained in your credit report.

In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due. 
If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within ten days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. And we must tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is. 
If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct. 

Special Rule for Credit Card Purchases 
If you have a problem with the quality of property or services that you purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or services. There are two limitations on this right: 
(1) you must have made the purchase in your home state or, if not within your home state, within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and 
(2) the purchase price must have been more than $50. 
These limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or services.

CEFCU VISA PLATINUM AND PLATINUM REWARDS CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT
This CEFCU� VISA� Platinum and Platinum Rewards Cardholder Agreement (�this agreement�) contains the terms and conditions which govern your CEFCU Platinum or Platinum Rewards VISA Credit Card and account. This agreement replaces all earlier agreements related to the Card and account. Please read the entire agreement and keep it for your records.
Throughout this agreement, the word �Card� means the CEFCU Platinum or Platinum Rewards VISA Credit Card(s) issued by CEFCU to you. The word �Card� also includes any other access devices, such as account numbers and Convenience Checks that we have issued to permit you to obtain credit under this agreement. The primary cardholder�s account number may differ from the other cardholder(s) account number(s), but all are part of the same account. We may issue Cards to renew your current Card or substitute and replace it with a different type of Card if your current type of Card is discontinued or for other reasons. The word �Card� also includes any renewal or substitute Card.
Throughout this agreement, the words �we�, �us�, �our� and �CEFCU� mean Citizens Equity First Credit Union, the issuer of your Card and account. The words �you� and �your� mean the primary cardholder, any other cardholder(s) and any person who has been authorized by you to receive and use the Card.
If at your request, we used your account to issue supplementary Cards to others, �you� will also mean each one of you. All of you individually and together agree to be bound by this agreement. In addition, this agreement will be binding on your personal and legal representatives.
Please sign the back of your Card when you receive it. You will be bound by this agreement even if you don�t sign your Card. If we have issued a Card to you; provided you with a renewal or replacement Card; or provided you with Convenience Checks, and you keep or use the Card or Convenience Checks, it means that you understand and agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. Your application for a Card and all other disclosure documents which we provide to you form an integral part of this agreement. 
USING YOUR ACCOUNT
Provided that your account is in good standing, you may draw on it by using your Card, by use of your Card together with your Personal Identification Number (PIN), by use of your account number without presenting your Card or by use of a CEFCU VISA Convenience Check provided you by CEFCU (�Convenience Check(s)� and/or other access devices included in the word �Card� when referring herein collectively to the access devices that we have issued to permit you to obtain credit under this agreement) wherever the Card or Convenience Checks are accepted or by Balance Transfers we allow or by Overdraft Protection we approve and up to the maximum amount we have set as your credit limit. We are not responsible for refusal by anyone to accept your Card or Convenience Check. You promise to use your account only for valid and lawful transactions. You agree not to use your account for internet gambling transactions or any illegal purpose or illegal transaction. Any such use by you will constitute (i) a waiver by you of any right to sue CEFCU respecting any such gambling transaction, illegal purpose or illegal transaction by you and (ii) your agreement to indemnify and hold CEFCU free and harmless from and against any suits or other legal action or liability, directly or indirectly, resulting from such gambling transaction, illegal purpose or illegal transaction by you. It is not our responsibility to make sure that you use your account only for permissible transactions, and you will remain responsible for paying for a transaction even if it is not permissible. You authorize us to pay for and charge your account for all transactions made on your account. 
Types Of Transactions
�	Purchases: You may use your Card to pay for goods or services.
�	Convenience Checks: We may provide you with Convenience Checks as a way to use your account. All transactions using Convenience Checks will be treated as Cash Advances and will be subject to the terms of this agreement that apply to Cash Advances unless you are notified otherwise in a written notice from CEFCU at the time we provide you with the Convenience Checks. All Convenience Checks issued prior to November 30, 2009, will be treated as Cash Advances and will be subject to the terms of this Agreement that apply to Cash Advances. Convenience Checks must be ordered through CEFCU. Only a person whose name is printed on a Convenience Check may sign it. All Convenience Checks must be written in U.S. Dollars. CEFCU will not certify a Convenience Check. CEFCU is entitled to return a Convenience Check unpaid if there is not enough available credit on your account to pay it, if you are in default under this agreement, if your Card or Convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen, if the Convenience Check is post-dated (shows a future date), or if the Convenience Check was not ordered through CEFCU. An interest charge will be imposed from the date a Convenience Check is posted to your account until the date it is fully paid. A Convenience Check cannot be used to make a payment on your account. Convenience Checks issued prior to January 1, 2009, will no longer be accepted.
�	Cash Advances: You may use your Card together with a PIN to obtain Cash Advances at any Automated Teller Machine (ATM) that allows you to use the Card. You may also obtain Cash Advances from financial institutions, businesses or merchants that accept the Card. If your Card is used to obtain a Cash Advance, you are deemed to have authorized the transaction. If you use the Card to obtain travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers or similar cash-like charges; or to obtain lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar gambling transactions, these transactions will be treated as Cash Advances. 
�	Balance Transfers: You may transfer balances from other accounts or loans with other credit card issuers or other lenders to your Card, or other Balance Transfers we allow. But you may not transfer balances to your Card from other accounts with us. If a portion of a requested balance transfer will exceed your available credit limit, we may process a partial balance transfer up to your available credit limit. A Balance Transfer will be processed by payment drawn on the account and made by us directly to the other credit card issuers or other lenders. 
�	Overdraft Protection: If CEFCU offers you Overdraft Protection from the account and if you have requested and we have approved Overdraft Protection for a Checking Account maintained with CEFCU (�Checking Account�) and provided your account is in good standing, you may draw on the account by making an Overdraft Protection funds transfer from the account to the Checking Account in accordance with the CEFCU Deposit Account Agreement and Rate and Fee Schedule. All funds will be transferred in increments of $100 and will be treated as Cash Advances and will be subject to the terms of this agreement that apply to Cash Advances. You acknowledge and agree that we may refuse an Overdraft Protection funds transfer from the account if the transfer would exceed the credit limit of the account. You further acknowledge and agree that anyone who is authorized to make withdrawals from the Checking Account may access your account through Overdraft Protection and that person will be an authorized user.
Mail, Telephone Or Internet Purchases
If you incur debt on your account without presentation of your Card (such as for mail or internet orders or telephone Purchases), your obligation to us will be the same as if the Card was used and a sales draft was signed by you.
Authorized Users
If you allow someone to use your account, that person will be an authorized user. You should think carefully before allowing anyone to become an authorized user because you are allowing that person to use the account as you can. You will remain responsible for the use of your account and each Card issued on your account according to the terms of this agreement. This includes your responsibility for paying all obligations reflecting Purchases and Cash Advances charged to your account by an authorized user.
You may request an additional Card for use by an authorized user on your account. If you do so, this account may appear on the credit report of that authorized user. If you have previously authorized someone to use your Card or Convenience Checks, and have subsequently withdrawn your authorization, you will continue to be liable for all obligations incurred by that person�s use of your Card prior to termination of that person�s permission to use your account.
You must notify us to terminate an authorized user�s permission to use your account. If you notify us, we may close the account and/or issue a new Card or Cards with a different account number. 
An authorized user�s permission to use your account will be considered terminated when we close the account and/or issue a new Card or Cards with a different account number. You should also recover and destroy any Cards, Convenience Checks or any other means of access to your account from that authorized user.
Not Exceeding Your Credit Limit
You agree not to incur any obligations in excess of the credit limit of the account authorized for you by CEFCU. The credit limit will be indicated in a separate disclosure document and/or on the cardmailer accompanying your Card and/or on your monthly statement. You may ask for a credit limit increase by calling: 1-800-858-3400 or (309) 633-3400.
If you exceed your credit limit, CEFCU may: (a) require the immediate payment of the amount in excess of the credit limit; (b) charge your account without waiving its right to demand immediate payment of the amount in excess of the credit limit; (c) refuse to permit any Purchases, Balance Transfers or Cash Advances in excess of the credit limit; and (d) reverse any Purchases, Balance Transfers or Cash Advances in excess of the credit limit as a result of the fault of the merchant or person selling the goods or services. This agreement applies to any balance over your credit limit. Subject to applicable law and at our discretion, we may increase, reduce or cancel your credit limit or allow you to exceed your credit limit without giving notice to you. However, if you have asked us not to do so, we will not increase your credit limit. A change to your credit limit will not affect your obligation to pay us. We reserve the right to refuse to honor any use of the Card or Convenience Checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit. 
Transactions In Foreign Currency
If you use your Card for transactions in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, the transactions will be converted by VISA to U.S. Dollars, using either (1) a rate selected by VISA from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives or (2) the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The currency conversion rate for the applicable central processing date may differ from the rate in effect at the time of the transaction or on the date the transaction is posted to your account. If a credit is subsequently given for a transaction and has a different central processing date, then the exchange rate of the credit may be greater or less than that of the original transaction. You agree to accept the converted amount in U.S. Dollars.
Refusal To Authorize Transactions
We may, but are not required to, decline a transaction on your account because of operational considerations, because your account is in default, to protect against potential fraudulent or unlawful activity, or in our discretion, for any other reason.
Should a transaction on your account be declined either by us or a third party, even if you have sufficient credit available, we will not be responsible for any losses that may result. For online transactions, we may require that you register your account with the �Verified by Visa� authorization system or such other authorization system as we may direct to protect you and us. We will notify you if we want you to register. If you do not register, we may not be able to honor your online transactions.



Loss, Theft Or Unauthorized Use
You will inform us immediately by telephone and in writing about any actual or suspected loss, theft or unauthorized use of your Card, account number, PIN or Convenience Checks. Notify us in writing at CEFCU, P.O. Box 1715, Peoria, Illinois 61656-1715 and by phone at (800) 633-7077 or (309) 633-7000, of the loss, theft or possible unauthorized use. You agree that we will consider that all transactions have been authorized by you until you advise us otherwise.
If your Card is lost or stolen, you will not be liable for unauthorized use of your Card. However, you must identify for us the unauthorized charges from which you received no benefit. We may ask for your assistance with our investigation by providing us information in writing to help us find out what happened.
Keep Your PIN Confidential
You agree to keep your PIN confidential and separate from your Card at all times. 
Ownership Of Card
You agree that the Card remains the property of CEFCU and will be surrendered to CEFCU on demand; and, that you do not have the right to assign or transfer your rights and obligations under this agreement, your account or any Cards to anyone else.
Observing Your Card�s Expiration Date
If your Card contains an expiration date, you agree not to use it or any Convenience Checks after such expiration date. If they are used, you agree to pay any debts that are incurred.
ATMs
The availability of ATM services and the Cash Advance amount you can withdraw each day may vary from time to time and without prior notice to you. We are not liable if ATM services are not available or for any loss or damage you may suffer because of your use of an ATM.
PAYMENTS
Providing You With Account Statements
We will send you a monthly account statement if there have been transactions during the last month or if you owe us any money on the account. The number of days covered by each account statement may vary (normally between 28 and 33 days) as a result of several factors, including holidays, weekends and the different number of business days in each month. We will send account statements only to the primary cardholder at the most current statement mailing address that we have on file. The statement shall be conclusively deemed correct and accepted by you unless CEFCU receives a proper written notification of a billing error within 60 days of the first mailing or delivery to you of the monthly statement on which the disputed item(s) or amount(s) is/are reflected. 
Repaying Your Obligations
When you access your account in a manner that we permit, or when you authorize others to use it, you will incur an obligation. You agree to pay all obligations reflecting Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances charged to your account because of authorized use of the Card by you and/or any person authorized by you to use the same upon presentment of such obligations to CEFCU. The primary cardholder agrees that, whether or not the other cardholder(s) is/are a member of CEFCU and whether or not the other cardholder(s)� Card(s) has/have a separate number and/or is/are embossed with the other cardholder(s)� name, he or she is primarily liable for paying all obligations reflecting Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances charged to the account. We will add a Finance Charge, fees and other applicable charges to your obligations and these amounts will form part of your obligations. You agree to pay CEFCU for all such obligations, at such place as CEFCU designates, with applicable interest charges and any Fees that may be due, in accordance with billings and the current Extended Payment Schedule. Interest charges shall continue to accrue until the principal balance is paid in full.
Keeping Your Account In Good Standing
When you incur obligations on your account, we will send you an account statement which will indicate the payment due date. If you do not repay your obligations in full by the payment due date, you agree to make the minimum monthly payment which we will indicate on your account statement. A Minimum Payment will appear on your account statement and payment of not less than the amount thereof must be made within 25 days after the Statement Date. The Minimum Payment will be the sum of (i) the amount determined in accordance with the following Extended Payment Schedule (Preliminary Minimum Payment), (ii) any amount past due, and (iii) any amount by which your New Balance exceeds your authorized credit limit. Extended Payment Schedule:  If the New Balance is $10.00 or less, the Preliminary Minimum Payment will be the New Balance in full. If the New Balance is more than $10.00, the Preliminary Minimum Payment will be 3% of the New Balance, or $10.00, whichever is greater. Any past due or over credit limit amount must be paid as soon as you receive your account statement. We may allow you, from time to time, to omit a monthly payment and we will notify you in writing when this option is available. If you choose to exercise this option, interest charges will continue to accrue.
Applying Your Payments
Your payment will be applied in a manner we determine. Subject to applicable law, we will apply your payment amounts in excess of your minimum payment (to the extent sufficient) to pay balances with higher interest charges before applying it to balances with lower interest charges. Subject to applicable law, we may adjust from time to time the date we use to determine the applicable interest rates and balances for applying your payment amounts in excess of your minimum payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a balance on your account is subject to deferred interest or a similar program under which you are not obligated to pay interest on that balance if you pay that balance in full within a specified period, we will apply your payment amounts in excess of your minimum payment during the two billing cycles immediately preceding the expiration of that specified period (to the extent sufficient) to pay that balance. Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to change the order in which we apply payments. The sooner you pay the New Balance, the less you will pay in interest charges.
Acceptance Of Late Or Partial Payments
We may delay enforcing our rights under this agreement and may accept late payments, partial payments and payments marked as �paid in full� or containing similar wording without losing any rights that we have under this agreement or by law, including the right to recover in full all amounts that you owe to us on your account.

Skip Payment Option
We may, at our option, allow you to skip a payment from time to time. You will be notified in advance of when this option is available to you. You may continue to make regular payments as determined in this agreement and/or additional payments if you wish and you will reduce the amount of interest charges that you will have to pay if you do so. If you exercise the skip payment option when it is made available to you, you will not be charged a Late Fee for those payments skipped. However, if you exercise the skip payment option when it is made available to you, interest charges and insurance premiums, if any, will continue to accrue on the entire unpaid balance of your account during that skip payment period in accordance with this agreement. The statement sent to you immediately following the skip payment period will indicate the Minimum Payment due. At that time, your Minimum Payments will return to the amount computed in accordance with the terms of this agreement and be due on the due dates as specified in this agreement.
Applying Credit Receipts
If you use your Card or Convenience Checks for a transaction which is subsequently cancelled and you are given a credit receipt, we will credit your account by the amount shown on the credit receipt within three (3) business days after our receipt of the credit transaction. The credit will be processed as of the posting date, not the transaction date for purposes of the Average Daily Balance calculation.
Credit Balances
You may request a refund of a credit balance at any time. We may reduce the amount of any credit balance by the amount of new charges or fees billed to your account. We will not pay you interest on any credit balances. If your account has a credit balance for four (4) or more consecutive statements we may refund the credit balance to your Savings account with us.
Right To Offset
If you have more than one account with us, and if any one of your accounts is not in good standing, you agree that we may offset your credit balance against the balance of the account which is not in good standing.
Pre-Authorized Debits
You may authorize a third party to automatically charge your account for repeat transactions by way of a pre-authorized debit (for example, monthly utility charges, memberships and insurance premiums). If pre-authorized debits are stopped for any reason (including because your account is closed or suspended for any reason) or your account number changes, you are responsible for notifying the biller and paying these charges directly. If your account number changes, we may, but are not required to, pay from your new account number charges that you authorized to be billed to your old account number.
Promotions
From time to time we may offer special terms for your account. If we do, we will notify you about the terms of the offer and how long they will be in effect. Any promotion is subject to the terms of this agreement, as modified by the promotional offer.
Making Payments
Payment can be made by you by the following methods:
�	Payment by mail or in person at any CEFCU office. If you pay by mail or in person at a CEFCU office, your payment must be accompanied by the specified detachable portion of your statement or a separate writing setting forth your name and correct VISA Account Number.

If you have authorized payment through the VISA ATP Program, then the amount you have specified in the VISA ATP Program, whether (a) the Minimum Payment, (b) a Fixed Monthly Amount, or (c) the New Balance in full, will, subject to the availability of sufficient funds in your designated Savings or Checking Account, be transferred in accordance with the VISA ATP Program on the next succeeding transfer date specified in your VISA ATP Program authorization unless (i) the statement shows an account balance of zero dollars and no payment due or (ii) you make written request to CEFCU not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the scheduled date of the transfer.

If the amount transferred in accordance with the VISA ATP Program or your ALC Program transfer authorization is less than the Minimum Payment, you agree to pay the balance of the Minimum Payment. You acknowledge that the VISA ATP Program and the ALC Program are offered as a convenience to CEFCU members and each is optional. If you have executed a VISA Automatic Transfer/Payment Program request or an ALC Program transfer authorization, you have authorized and directed CEFCU to make transfers in accordance with that request. It is understood that if you have executed a VISA ATP Program request or an ALC Program transfer authorization, unless your participation in either Program has been terminated in accordance with the terms of that Program, the request or authorization will remain in full force and effect until you cancel the request or authorization by written notice to CEFCU at least three (3) Business Days prior to the next scheduled transfer date.

If you select this Auto Pay option, there is an additional Auto Pay service authorization form that you will need to request, sign and return to us before we can process payments automatically. If you select this Auto Pay option, you agree to pay CEFCU�s applicable Auto Pay fee, if any. You may notify us in accordance with the terms of this form if you wish to revoke your authorization for Auto Pay.

A payment made by mail at an address other than the address specified in your periodic statement and/or payment made in any other manner than stated above may result in a delay in crediting your account, but in no event more than five (5) days from the date of receipt, and may subject you to additional interest charges and Late Payment Fees. A payment made by mail, in person at a CEFCU office, by telephone transfer, by using CEFCU�s Money Center 24 ATM network, Fast Track Teller, CEFCU On-Line Program, Touch-Tone Teller Program, tele-entry transaction (ACH transfer from an account at another institution) or by Auto Pay that is made by 5:00 p.m. Central Time Monday through Friday will not result in an increase to your available credit until the first Business Day after the date your payment is credited to your account. A payment made by mail, in person at a CEFCU office, by telephone transfer, or by using CEFCU�s Money Center 24 ATM network, Fast Track Teller, CEFCU On-Line or Touch-Tone Teller Programs after 5:00 p.m. Central Time or on Saturday or Sunday and a Payment made to your account using the VISA ATP Program or the ALC Program, tele-entry transaction (ACH transfer from an account at another institution), or by Auto Pay will not result in an increase to your available credit until the second Business Day after the date your payment is credited to your account. For purposes of this paragraph, Business Day means Monday through Friday (except for days our offices are not open and except for Christmas Eve Day); and, by mail means by first class mail postage prepaid addressed to CEFCU at the address specified in your periodic statement. You may prepay your New Balance in full without penalty. The closing date of the billing cycle is referred to as the �Statement Date� and will be specified on your statement. All Payments, Credits, Cash Advances, and Purchases made after the Statement Date will appear on your next statement.
INTEREST CHARGES
The Conditions Under Which Interest Charges Will be Imposed
Cash Advances/Convenience Checks. We will begin charging interest on Cash Advances on the transaction date, unless the Cash Advance transaction is not posted to your account until a date in a billing cycle beginning after the billing cycle in which the Cash Advance transaction occurred, and, in that event, interest will be imposed from the first day of the billing cycle in which the Cash Advance transaction is posted to your account, and will continue until the date Payment is received by CEFCU. Any Cash Advance you obtain on your account and any transaction by which you purchase items that are directly convertible to cash will constitute Cash Advances. Examples of such transactions are the purchase of money orders, wire transfer money orders, casino gaming chips, opening deposits, travelers checks, Visa Travel Money Cards and foreign currency. Unless otherwise provided in a written notice from CEFCU to you sent with the convenience check on or after November 30, 2009, all Convenience Check transactions are considered Cash Advances. There is no time period within which to avoid this interest charge.
Purchases and Balance Transfers. Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any interest on Purchases and Balance Transfers if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month.  If you do not pay your entire balance by the due date, interest will be imposed from the date the Purchase or Balance Transfer transaction occurs, unless the Purchase or Balance Transfer transaction is not posted to your account until a later billing cycle in which event interest on that Purchase or Balance Transfer will be imposed from the first day of the billing cycle in which it is posted to your account, and will continue until the date payment is received by CEFCU. Interest charge will also be imposed on Purchases and Balance Transfers included in the New Balance when the New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the Statement Date.
The Method Of Determining The Balance Subject To Interest Rate
Interest charge will be imposed on the �Average Daily Balance� of Cash Advances, the �Average Daily Balance� of Balance Transfers and the �Average Daily Balance� of Purchases on your account, including current transactions (those occurring since your last billing statement). We figure the interest charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the �Average Daily Balance� of your account (including current transactions).

The card may be used to purchase merchandise and services in those establishments where the Card is accepted, and to obtain cash advances from the Bank or any other bank that accepts the Cards, subject to the limits established from time to time by the Bank. 

CREDIT LIMIT
You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases and cash advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each monthly Account Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you exceed your authorized credit limit; the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return or forfeit the Card and close the account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized credit limit. The Bank may approve purchases or cash advances which cause the balance to exceed your credit limit without waiving any of its rights under this Agreement.

INTEREST CHARGES APPLICABLE TO PUERTO RICO AND US VIRGIN ISLANDS:
The INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on the principal balance only. You will pay a monthly INTEREST CHARGE on the balance of your account for the billing period. This INTEREST CHARGE will be variable and can change for each billing period. The INTEREST CHARGE for purchases, balance transfers from other institutions and convenience checks will be determined by adding the value of the United States Prime Rate, published in The Wall Street Journal (Prime Rate) to a margin. This is equivalent to the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE for cash advances will be determined by adding the Prime Rate to a margin.� To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. For each billing period, the INTEREST CHARGE and the APR will be based on the Prime Rate current three business days prior to your account statement closing date. In the event that The Wall Street Journal is not published within any time period, the �LA TIMES� will be used as reference. An increase of the Prime Rate could represent an increase in the APR and in the minimum monthly payment. Any change in your INTEREST CHARGE will apply to the Balance in your account and to new transactions during the billing period.� The INTEREST CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the number of days in the billing cycle. The Average Daily Balance is obtained by taking into account the initial balance for each day of the billing period, subtracting the payments and credits, and adding the purchases. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the said total is divided by the number of days included within the billing period. 

ANNUAL FEE
If applicable, the Annual Fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the first Card. Please refer to the section �Annual Fee� in the table included.

BENEFITS FOR PRIVATE BANKING CLIENTS OF BANCO POPULAR
If you are a Private Banking Customer of Banco Popular, the Card will be issued at a preferential interest rate and will not be subject to Annual Fee. In case you discontinue your Private Banking services, these benefits may be eliminated.

MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 
The monthly minimum payment will be determined using the Outstanding Balance. In addition, the minimum monthly payment shall include the total amount in excess of your authorized credit limit.  For balances from $0.01 to $24.99 the Minimum Payment will be the Outstanding Balance.  For Balances of $25 and over the Minimum Payment will be 2% of the Outstanding Balance or the INTEREST CHARGEs + $10 or a fixed amount of $25, whichever is higher.  

PAYMENT APPLICATION

Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required payment the excess will be applied to the most onerous debt.

VISA� Secured


CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT



NOTICE: See reverse side for important information regarding your rights to dispute billing errors.

In this Agreement, the words you and your mean the person or persons who use or authorize the use of, or who sign an application for, a Christian Community Credit Union VISA Secured. Card means the Christian Community Credit Union VISA Secured and any duplicates and renewals the Credit Union issues to you. Account means your VISA Secured line of credit account with the Credit Union. Credit Union means Christian Community Credit Union.

1.Using the Account. If your application for a VISA Secured account is approved, the Christian Community Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you and notify you of its amount when the card is sent to you. You agree not to let your account balance exceed your approved credit limit. Each payment you make on the account will restore your credit limit by the amount of the payment which is applied to the principal amount of purchases and cash advances. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by written application submitted to the Credit Union. The Credit Union has the right to reduce or terminate your credit limit at any time.
2.Using the Card. You may use your card to purchase goods and services in person, online, and by mail or telephone from merchants and others who accept VISA/MasterCard credit cards. In addition, you may obtain cash advances up to $1,000 of your approved and available credit limit from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions or select merchants participating in the VISA/MasterCard program and from automated teller machines (ATMs), such as VISA/MasterCard ATM Network, that provide access to the VISA/MasterCard system. (Not all merchants or ATMs provide such access.) You will need to use your Personal Identification Number (PIN) to obtain a cash advance from an ATM.
3.Illegal Use of VISA Credit Card. You agree that your VISA Credit Card Account will not be used to make or facilitate any transaction(s) that are or might be construed to be illegal pursuant to applicable law, rule or ordinance, including but not limited to gambling. Said use, including any such authorized use, will constitute an event of default under this Agreement. You agree that the Credit Union has no liability, responsibility or culpability whatsoever for any such use by you or any authorized user(s). You agree that you are responsible for repayment of any and all debts incurred for these transactions. You further agree to indemnify and hold the Credit Union harmless from any suits, liability, damages or adverse action of any kind that results directly or indirectly from such illegal use.
4.Responsibility. You agree to pay all charges (purchases and cash advances) to your account made by you or anyone who you authorize to use your account. You also agree to pay all other charges added to your account, pursuant to Paragraph 7. Your obligation to pay the amount owed on your account continues until paid in full even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which the Credit Union is not a party may direct someone else to pay the account balance. If more than one person signs this Agreement, each is individually responsible for all amounts owed on the account and all are jointly responsible for all amounts owed. This means the Credit Union can enforce this Agreement against any of you individually or all of you collectively.
5.Finance Charges. In order to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases made since your last statement date, you must pay the Total New Balance shown on your statement within 25 days of the statement closing date. Otherwise the FINANCE CHARGE on purchases is calculated from the beginning of the next statement period on previously billed but unpaid purchases and on new purchases from the date they are posted to your account. Cash advances and balance transfers are always subject to a FINANCE CHARGE from the date they are posted to your account. 
We figure the FINANCE CHARGE on your account by applying the periodic rate to the ��average daily balance�� of your account. To get the ��average daily balance�� we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases, and cash advances, and subtract any unpaid other finance charges and any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the ��average daily balance.�
SECURED PLATINUM REWARDS VISA ACCOUNT
Your Secured Platinum Rewards VISA Account will be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE (interest) at an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and a corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate which will be a standard variable (floating) rate based upon an index plus a margin. The margin applicable to your account will be determined by your creditworthiness. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and the corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate will apply to purchases, cash advances and balance transfers.  
Index
The Index is Prime Rate (�Index�). Information about this Index is published in the Money Rates Table of the Wall Street Journal.  
Rate Changes
The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE may change on the first (1st) day each month. These are known as rate change dates. The Index value used for a given billing cycle will be the value published on first (1st) business day before the change date or the most recently published value published before the change date. If more than one rate is published, the Index will be the highest of the rates published. If the Index ceases to be published, the Credit Union will choose a new Index and give you notice of its choice.
Determination of Annual Percentage Rate
The Credit Union will add a margin ranging from 7.65% to 13.65%, depending on your credit score, to the Index to get the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE applicable to your Account for the billing cycle.  Notification of the margin for which you have been approved will be provided on the Secured Platinum Rewards VISA Approval Letter sent to you upon completion of the credit review and approval.  
ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE for the billing cycle will be divided by twelve (12) to get the corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate for the billing cycle. An increase or decrease in the Prime Rate will lead to an increase or decrease in your ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and the corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate applicable to your Account. 
Limitations on Changes
There is no limit on the amount by which the rate changes in any one-year period. The maximum ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that can apply is 18.00%. 
Annual Percentage Rate Example
Based upon a margin of 7.65% (your margin may be different depending on your credit score) plus an Index value of 3.25%, (which was the value of the Index on February 1, 2010), your Account would be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE (interest) at an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 10.90%, with a corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate of 0.9083%. 
On the first (1st) day of each calendar month and on each subsequent change date, the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and the corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate will be calculated according to the formula described above and will be stated on our Secured Platinum Rewards VISA Approval Letter.
6.Change in Terms; Changing or Terminating Your Account. The Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement, including your ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, from time to time for any reason not inconsistent with applicable law after giving you any advance notice required by law. Your use of the card after receiving notice of a change will indicate your agreement to the change. To the extent the law permits, and except as otherwise indicated in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. Either the Credit Union or any one of you may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. The cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union.
7.Other Charges. The following Other Charges will be added to your account, as applicable:
�If you are a credit card member only with no other relationship with Christian Community Credit Union, a one-time non-refundable membership fee of $5.00 will be charged to your credit card account.

�COPIES: If you request a copy of any document, we may charge your account $5.00 per copy requested. If your request is related to a billing error and an error is found, we will credit any copying charges to your account.

�NSF CHECKS: A fee of $25.00 will be assessed for each card payment check that is returned to the Credit Union for nonsufficient funds.

9.Monthly Payment. Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the Payment Due Date shown. You may, of course, pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment, or pay the Total New Balance in full. If you make extra payments or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance. The minimum payment is 3% of your Total New Balance but not less than $10.00, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not paid. 
10.Default. You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to immediately terminate this Agreement and require repayment of your outstanding account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. At the Credit Union�s discretion, any shares that were given as security may be applied towards what you owe. To the extent permitted by law, you will also be required to pay the Credit Union�s collection expenses, including court costs and attorneys� fees.
11.Liability for Unauthorized Use. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of your card, you should write to us immediately at: 255 N. Lone Hill Avenue, San Dimas, CA 91773, or call us at (800) 449-7728. 
You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.
12.Liability for Unauthorized Use of Your VISA Credit Card. If there is unauthorized use on your consumer VISA Credit Card your liability will be zero ($0.00). This provision limiting your liability does not apply to either Business Platinum Rewards VISA cards, ATM cash disbursements, or non-VISA PIN-less debit transactions. Additionally, your liability with respect to unauthorized transactions may be greater than the above limit, to the extent allowed under applicable law, if the Christian Community Credit Union reasonably determines, based on substantial evidence, that you were grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handling of your account or card.
13.Credit Information. You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. Pursuant to state law, you are hereby notified that a negative credit report reflecting on your credit record may be submitted to a credit reporting agency if you fail to fulfill the terms of your credit obligations.
14.Returns and Adjustments. Merchants and others who honor the card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the amount is $1 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six months.
15.Foreign Transactions. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. Transactions processed outside of the United States, or in a foreign currency may be charged a foreign transaction fee, regardless of whether there is a currency conversion associated with the transaction. The conversion rate in dollars will be a rate selected by VISA from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable Central Processing Date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable Central Processing Date in each instance, plus a one percentage point (1.0%) fee charged by the Issuer.
16.Merchant Disputes. The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor the card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home.
17.Effect of Agreement. This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.
18.No Waiver. The Credit Union can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.
19.Statements and Notices. You will receive a statement each month showing transactions on your account. Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all. You agree to promptly notify the Credit Union if you change your mailing address.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER WE RECEIVE YOUR LETTER
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
1.Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter.
We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2.Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
�We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
�The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
�While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
�We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
�If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
�If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.
YOUR RIGHTS IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1.The purchase must have been made in your home State or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2.You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3.You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at: Christian Community Credit Union, 255 N. Lone Hill Avenue, San Dimas, CA 91773. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above.
After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

creditcardagreement_3233.TXT,"University of Illinois Alumni Association VISA Platinum with Rewards CONSUMER CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT

In this Agreement, �Agreement� means this Consumer Credit Card Agreement. �Disclosure� means the Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement.

1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will not allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that exceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled �Statements and Notices�) explaining your right to opt in to the Credit Union�s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in to such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor.

You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request.

2. USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers and money orders. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal.

3. PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account.

4. PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement.

5. FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date). The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. 

For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases.

For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances.

6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.

7. FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.

a. Annual Fee. If your account is subject to an Annual Fee, the fee will be charged to your account upon the issuance of your card. Each year following, the annual fee will be charged to your account during the same month that you were first charged the fee. The fee will be charged each year until your account is closed and paid in full.

b. Balance Transfer Fee. If your account is subject to a Balance Transfer Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you transfer a balance from an account of another creditor to the account subject to this Agreement.

c. Cash Advance Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Cash Advance Fee (finance charge), the fee will be charged to your account when you obtain a cash advance from an ATM, the Credit Union or other financial institution.

d. Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency.

e. Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.

f. Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when a payment is returned for any reason.

g. Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request.

h. Emergency Card Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to an Emergency Card Replacement Fee, a fee will be charged to your account for each emergency replacement card that is issued to you.

i. Card Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to a Card Replacement Fee, a fee will be charged for each replacement card that is issued to you for any reason.

8. PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 3.00% of your total new balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on the statement. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit.

9. PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate.

10. SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount.

Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default.

Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement.

11. DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. 

When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe.

12. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION � You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at Cardmember Services, PO Box 30495, Tampa, FL 33630 or telephone (800) 808-7230 seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.

13. CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT � As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. 

Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized. 

The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account.

14. CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS � Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user. If you cannot return the authorized user's card or access checks and if you request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for a new account.

15. CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION � You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing.

16. RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS � Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6) months.

17. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS � The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit Union is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.

18. MERCHANT DISPUTES � The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home.

19. JOINT ACCOUNTS � If this is a joint account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may terminate the account and the termination will be effective as to all of you.

20. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT � This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.

- At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter

When we receive your letter, we must do two things:

1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:

       - We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
- The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
- While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
       - We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:

- If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
- If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.

If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.

Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.

To use this right, all of the following must be true:

1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
       3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing [or electronically] at:

       University of Illinois Employees Credit Union
       2201 South First St.
       P.O. Box 500
       Champaign, IL 61824-0500
       www.uiecu.org

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

This document explains the rules which govern your State Credit Union Visa credit card account.  Please read carefully and keep in a safe and convenient place.  
1.
 Interest will not be imposed on credit purchases of goods and services if you pay the entire new balance shown on the previous monthly statement within 25 days from the closing date of the statement. 

2. 
There is no grace period on cash advances made on your card. Interest will be charged from the date of the cash advance. If your balance is paid prior to the due date, no additional interest will be accrued in the current billing cycle. (See Balance Computation Method below.) 

3.
 Balance Computation method for interest:  We calculate the interest on your account by applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your account. To get the �average daily balance,� we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases and cash advances, unpaid interest, current late payment fees, and other applicable fees, and subtract any payments or credits. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance. 

Partial Grace:  Partial Grace adds an additional grace period to portions of an unpaid balance in the billing period where an account moves from paid-in-full to revolving status.  In the transition-to-revolving billing period, balances equal to the amount of any partial payment must not be included in the Average Daily Balance subject to interest.  The month an account becomes revolving is the first month where the payment made by the payoff exception date (most frequently cycle date) is less than the statement balance owed.  Partial Grace only applies to transactions that are subject to a grace period. 

4.
 The MINIMUM monthly payment is 2.5% of the new balance or $25.00, whichever is greater. 

5. 
 Cardholder payments made in excess of the minimum payment due will be applied to the highest APR balance first and then, in order, down to the lowest APR balance. 

6. 
Over-limit conditions must be cleared immediately because your account will not be allowed future approvals until your balance is below the approved limit.  

7. 
A fee (see fee schedule) will be charged on any check issued for payment on your credit card if the check is dishonored and returned. This fee will be added to your account balance. 

8. 
With your SCU Visa� card, you may obtain cash advances at any financial institution displaying the Visa logo. Cash advances are also available at many ATMs. 

9.
 Your Visa card is issued for a 24-month or 36-month period, but it can be cancelled by State Credit Union at any time if used improperly or payments are not made. We will notify you in writing if your account is closed due to inactivity for 18 or more months. 

10. 
Credit Life Insurance is available at the member�s option.  Credit Disability Insurance is also available. The charges will be added to your account balance each month. 

11. 
 You agree to notify us immediately at our credit card partner, PSCU Service Center, at 1-800-449-7728 or 1-800-790-7728 of the loss, theft or unauthorized use of your credit card.  You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card.  You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50 for unauthorized cash advances at ATMs.  You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your credit card.  If you report your card Lost/Stolen, it is your responsibility to destroy any remaining cards with that number.  If you find the Lost/Stolen card, you should destroy the card and notify the Credit Union or PSCU Service Center. If you use the card and it is recovered by an authorized Visa merchant (because it appears on the Revoked Card List or the Visa Center tells the merchant to pick up the card), then you will be liable for any fees, costs or merchant awards resulting from your unauthorized use of the card. 

12. 
There will be a replacement fee (see fee schedule) for a mutilated card or if the card is more than ninety (90) days from the scheduled reissue. Expired cards will be reissued without cost to you. 

13.
 If you ask for a copy of a document, such as a convenience check or billing statement, a per-hour charge (see fee schedule) may be imposed for the time that is required to research and locate the document. In addition, a copying fee (see fee schedule) will be charged. No charge will be imposed in connection with any billing error. 

14. 
 Upon opening your account, you will receive convenience checks that access your credit card account. Please note: Convenience 
Checks are treated as Cash Advances. These checks are good for only 90 days.  We will begin charging interest on these checks on the 
transaction date. Since convenience checks can not be ordered other than at account opening, please contact SCU for alternative cash 
advance options.  If you are over your credit limit, are in default, your account privileges have been canceled, or your card expired, we may 
decline to honor a convenience check and a fee (see fee schedule) will be added to your account balance.  Convenience checks may be used 
only by the person whose name is printed on them.  You may not use convenience checks to pay any amount which you owe SCU.  Paid 
convenience checks will not be returned to you.  There is a fee (see fee schedule) when you stop payment on a convenience check.  It is the 
Credit Union�s sole discretion to issue convenience checks to any member. 


15. 
If you incur a charge (a Purchase or Cash Advance) in a foreign currency, the charge will be converted into a U.S. dollar amount in 
accordance with the operating regulations of Visa international in effect at the time that the transaction is processed. Currently, these 
Regulations provide that the currency conversion rate to be used is either: (a) a wholesale market rate; or (b) a government-mandated rate in 
effect one day prior to the processing date, increased by one percent in each case. Visa retains this one percent as compensation for 
performing the currency conversion service.  The Credit Union reserves the right to charge a fee for this service with appropriate legal notice. 
The currency conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date or the posting date.  


16. 
Your Visa card may not be used for any illegal transaction, such as unlawful gambling. 


17.
 The Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement, including the Annual Percentage Rate, with 45 days written notice. Except 
where limited by applicable law, the new terms, including but not limited to, the way the Credit Union calculates interest, and the minimum 
payment due, will apply to both new purchases and cash advances and to the existing outstanding balance of your account as of the day of 
the change. In accordance with applicable law, the Credit Union will notify you of any increased charge.  However, if the APR changes, the 
new APR will apply only to new purchases and cash advances. If you receive notification of an increase in the APR or other �significant 
change� in terms, you will have the right to cancel before the effective date of the increase or change in order for your account to remain 
under the same terms and conditions.   Your minimum payment requirement would remain the same. 


18.
 The use of your card confirms agreement to the Visa terms and conditions as well as the terms outlined herein. Complete disclosures, 
terms and conditions will be provided to you. Please read all terms and conditions prior to use of your card.  If you do not agree with the 
terms and conditions provided, contact the SCU Visa Department in writing (mail or fax) immediately to cancel the account. 


19.
 BILLING RIGHTS 
In Case of Errors or Inquiries about Your Bill: 
If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet of paper at the 
address indicated below as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error 
or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. 
In your letter give us the following information: 




*
 Your name and account number. 


*
 The dollar amount of the suspected error. 


*
 Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are unsure about. 
You do not have to pay any amount in question while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in 
question. While we investigate your question, we cannot report you as delinquent or take any action to collect the amount you question. 



If you have a problem with the quality of goods or services that you purchased with a credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may not have to pay the remaining amount due on the goods or services. You have this protection only when the purchase price was more than $50.00 and the purchase was made in your home state or within 100 miles of your mailing address. (If we own or operate the merchant, or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or services, all purchases are covered regardless of amount or location of purchase.) 
Send Inquiries to: 
S.C. State Federal Credit Union Visa Department 
P.O. Box 726 Columbia, S.C. 29202 

20.
 If your account goes past due, no further approvals or advances will be made until your account is current. A chronic past-due condition will cause your credit card to be revoked. A late fee (see fee schedule) will be assessed if the account becomes 10 days delinquent from the date of the billing cycle.  Payments must be received by 5:00 p.m. EST in order to receive credit for that day. 

21.
 If your account goes past due sixty (60) days, the card may be cancelled. However, the Credit Union may reinstate your card provided your account is brought up to date and is given reasonable assurance it will not become past due again. Any future recurrence will cause an automatic cancellation. The Credit Union may demand payment in full upon written notice to the cardholder, on any delinquent or cancelled account. 

22. 
Your monthly statement is your bill. You are required to immediately notify the Credit Union in writing if your name and/or home address changes. Your due date will remain the same each month. 

23.
 Your performance under this agreement may be reported to Credit Reporting Agencies. Protect your credit rating by paying promptly. 

24. 
You may close your account at any time by notifying us in writing and returning your card or cards, cut in half. You will still remain responsible for payment of the amount owed to the Credit Union according to the terms and conditions in effect at the time you close your account. 

25.
 Keep your copy of transaction slips. Checking your copies against your monthly statement can help you guard against incorrect charges and fraudulent vendors. 

26.
 Be careful about placing orders by telephone, mail or internet. Satisfy yourself that the company is a reputable firm. 

27.
 Do not carry cards that are used infrequently, but store in a secure manner where no one else has access to them. 

28.
 Sign all new cards immediately after receiving them. 

29.
 Insist that any duplicate transaction slips made through error be destroyed. It is also a good idea to have any carbon papers destroyed as well. 

30. 
 The Credit Union currently offers a Rewards Program.  SCU reserves the right to make changes in the CURewards program and/or redemptions without notice; and may cancel the program with 15 days notice, after which the Credit Union shall have no obligations under the program or the rewards canceled. 


Visa Terms & Conditions 
The person (�Cardholder�) whose name is embossed on the face of the Visa card (�Card�) applied for and was issued, and each Cardholder, in the event more than one Card is enclosed herewith bearing the same account number, by signing or using said Card, receipt of which is acknowledged, agrees with the issuer of the Card, SC State Federal Credit Union (SCU) as follows: 
1.
 Goods and services (�Credit Purchases�) may be purchased or leased by means of such card by Cardholder from any retail business establishment (�Seller�) who honors same upon the execution of a sales slip evidencing such Credit Purchase and bearing the account number of Cardholder embossed on the face of such Card. Additionally, Visa Cash Advance (�Loans�) may be obtained through use of such Card (a) upon execution of a written request of Cardholder in a form furnished to him/her from any bank that is a member, alone or in association with others, of Visa Inc. and (b) upon execution of a written separate agreement with issuer for a Visa overdraft financing agreement, if offered by issuer. Up to 15 authorizations may be granted per day. 

2.
 Cardholder shall be liable and agrees to pay issuer for Credit Purchases made by, or for Loans extended to, Cardholder or anyone else using such Card unless the use of such Card is by a person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, implied or apparent authority for such use, and (b) from which Cardholder receives no benefit. 

Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally liable and agrees to pay for all Credit Purchases and Loans obtained through the use of any other Card bearing Cardholder�s account number that has been issued to another person by reason of such person being a member of Cardholder�s family, or otherwise issued upon Cardholder�s request (all such Cards bearing the same Visa account number hereinafter collectively called �Related Cards�). Further, if you authorize us to honor any Purchase or Cash Advance you make by telephone, mail, or internet on this account, you agree that a signature is not necessary as identification in such cases. 

3.
 Each Card is the property of issuer, is not transferrable and must be surrendered upon demand. It can be cancelled as well as repossessed by Issuer or its designee, and the privileges thereof revoked at any time without prior notice. 

4.
 Cardholder shall not use Card or permit the use of Related Cards to obtain Credit Purchases or Loans which will increase Cardholder�s Visa indebtedness to Issuer to an amount in excess of the limit established by Issuer. 

5.
 All Credit Purchases and Loans are affected at the option of the Seller and Cash Advancing Bank, respectively, and Issuer shall not be responsible for refusal by any Seller or Cash Advancing Bank to honor the Card or any Related Card.  Any refund, adjustment or credit allowed by Seller shall not be by cash but rather by a credit advice to Issuer which shall be shown as a credit on Cardholder�s account statement with Issuer. 

6.
 Issuer will send to Cardholder, at monthly intervals determined by Issuer, a statement reflecting for the prior monthly period all Visa Card and Related Card transactions. Such statement shall be deemed correct and accepted by Cardholder and all holders of Related Cards unless Issuer is notified to the contrary in writing within 60 days of mailing of such statement. Cardholder will pay such statement by remitting to Issuer within 25 days of the closing date reflected on the statement either the full amount billed or, at Cardholder�s option, an Installment equal to at least the required minimum payment stated in Paragraph 4 of the Disclosures. 

7.
 Interest on Loans and Credit Purchases will be charged in accordance with the interest calculation method referred to in Paragraph 3 of the Disclosures. The rate of interest shall be established by Issuer.  

8.
 If the Card is cancelled or surrender is demanded by Issuer, or if Cardholder defaults in any payment due, or is deceased, bankrupt or insolvent, or any attachment or garnishment proceedings are initiated against Cardholder or his/her property, Issuer may elect to declare all amounts then owed to Issuer to be immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind. If Cardholder has other loans from Issuer, or takes out other loans with Issuer in the future, collateral securing those loans will also secure the Cardholder�s obligation under this agreement. However, unless the Cardholder expressly agrees otherwise, the Cardholder�s primary dwelling will not secure Cardholder�s obligations under this agreement even if Issuer has or later acquires a mortgage on the dwelling. Cardholder agrees to pay all costs incurred by Issuer in collecting Cardholder�s indebtedness or in enforcing this agreement, including attorney�s fees of 10% of the unpaid balance or such greater amount as may be reasonable and just and also those costs, expenses and attorney�s fees incurred in appellate, bankruptcy and post judgments proceedings except to the extent such costs, fees or expenses are prohibited by law. 

9.
 The validity, construction and enforcement of this agreement and all matters arising out of the issuance and use of the Card shall be governed by Federal law.

Consumer Credit Card Agreement

Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" ""your,"" and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union
whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement.

1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will not allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that exceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled ""Statements and Notices"") explaining your right to opt in to the Credit Union’s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in to such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor.

You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request.

2. USING YOUR CARD — You understand that the use of your credit card will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN
issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery
tickets, and casino gaming chips, as applicable. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal.

3. PROMISE TO PAY — You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account.

4. PERIODIC RATES — The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance
transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on
the terms of this Agreement.

5. FINANCE CHARGES — New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the
entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. New cash advances posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or if you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle’s billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date you get a cash advance or the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. To avoid an additional finance charge on the
balance of cash advances, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement.
The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and
divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases.
For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To get the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. Then, we add all the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and
divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance
transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances.

6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the
applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have
been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all
single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is
any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.

You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 2.00% of your total new balance, or $15.00, whichever is
greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, and any amount you are over your credit limit. In addition to the minimum payment, you must also pay, by the date specified above, the amount of any prior minimum payment (s) that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit.

However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate.

10. SECURITY INTEREST — You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase.

amount. Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are
in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default. Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be
considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement.

11. DEFAULT — You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something
happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe.

12. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION — You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at 2010 Lafayette Rd., Portsmouth, NH 03801-5643 or telephone 800-543-5073 seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day or 800-936-7730 seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card.

If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized. The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account.

You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user.

APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: 

In accordance with applicable law, we will 
choose the order in which any Minimum 
Payment will be applied to your indebtedness to 
us at the time the payment is made. Any
payment you make in excess of any required
Minimum Payment will be applied first to 
balances with the highest ANNUAL PERCENTAGE 
RATE and then to each successive 
balance bearing the next highest ANNUAL 
PERCENTAGE RATE. Payments in excess of
the required Minimum Payment will not affect 
your obligation to make future required
Minimum Payments, calculated in accordance
with this Agreement, while any balances are
outstanding. We will allow time for checks and
automatic payments to be honored by your bank
before the funds will be available for future 
purchases, cash advances or balance transfers.
Payments received after 5:00 p.m. which are 
mailed to the address on your monthly statement 
will be posted the following business day.
From time to time, we may let you skip or reduce
one or more monthly payments during a year
and/or we may temporarily reduce or eliminate
certain INTEREST CHARGES on all or a portion
of your Credit Card account balance or offer you
other special terms. If we do, we will advise you
of the scope and duration of the applicable skip
or promotional feature. When the skip or promotional 
feature ends, your regular rates and all the
terms of the Agreement will resume. We may 
allow time for checks and automatic payments 
to be honored by your bank before the funds will 
be available for future purchases, cash 
advances, balance transfers or convenience 
checks. 

INTEREST CHARGE: 

An INTEREST CHARGE will be imposed on 
Credit Purchases only if you elect not to pay the
entire New Balance shown on your monthly
statement for the previous billing cycle within 25
days from the closing date of that statement. If
you elect not to pay the entire New Balance
within that 25-day period, an INTEREST 
CHARGE will be imposed on the unpaid average 
daily balance of the Credit Purchases 
comprising such New Balance. The INTEREST
CHARGE will be imposed on such Credit 
Purchases from the closing date of the statement. 
The INTEREST CHARGE will continue to 
accrue until the closing date of the billing cycle
preceding the date on which the entire New
Balance is paid in full or until the date of 
payment if more than 25 days from that closingdate. 

5 

The INTEREST CHARGE on Credit Purchases 
for a billing cycle is computed by applying the
�Monthly Periodic Rate� to the Average Daily
Balance of Credit Purchases, which is determined 
by dividing the sum of the daily balances
during the billing cycle by the number of days in
the cycle. To get the �Monthly Periodic Rate�
applicable to the current billing cycle, the Annual
Percentage Rate (APR) in effect is divided by

12. If you elect not to pay the entire New 
Balance within the 25-day period, each daily
balance of Credit Purchases is determined by
adding to the outstanding unpaid balance of 
Credit Purchases at the beginning of the billing
cycle any new Credit Purchases made on your
Account and subtracting any payments as 
received and credits as posted to your Account,
but excluding any unpaid INTEREST CHARGE.
If you pay your balance in full each month, but
pay less than the full balance in any given
month, we will credit any payment made within
the 25-day period on the first day of the billing
cycle. 
You cannot avoid INTEREST CHARGES on 
Cash Advances. INTEREST CHARGES on 
cash advances begin on the date of the 
advance and continue until your Cash Advance
Balance is paid in full. The Average Balance of
Cash Advances is the sum of the unpaid
balances of Cash Advances on each day of the
current billing cycle divided by the number of
days in the current billing cycle. 

Such unpaid balances on Purchases and Cash
Advances are subject to INTEREST CHARGES
computed by applying a Monthly Periodic Rate
as explained above. 

The minimum INTEREST CHARGE is $.50. 

ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE: 

The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES (APRs)
applicable to your Account may vary or 
increase. The APRs will be determined monthly
by adding a Spread to an Index. The Index for
each billing cycle is the U.S. �Prime Rate� 
published in the Money Rates table of the Wall
Street Journal during the calendar month immediately 
preceding the calendar month in which
the billing cycle ends. In each case, the spreads
applicable to your Account will be based on our
assessment of your creditworthiness at the time
of your application. Please see attached letter 
and Account Opening Disclosure for specific
information that relates to the current value of 
the index and your applicable spread. 

6 

CREDIT BALANCE: 

If your total new balance is a credit balance, we 
will refund the amount of the credit to you
promptly, if you request us to in writing, or as
required by law. Credit balances of less than 
$1.00 will not be refunded unless requested by
the cardholder prior to the balance being on the
account for less than 90 days. 

FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS: 

If you make any purchase in foreign currencies, 
Visa U.S.A. will convert the foreign currencies
into U.S. Dollars using their applicable currency
conversion procedures. Currently, the conversion 
procedures utilize a rate selected from a
range of rates available in wholesale currency
markets for the applicable central processing
date, which rate may vary from the rate they
receive, or the government mandated rate in
effect for the applicable central processing date,
in each instance, plus or minus any adjustment
determined by the Bank. You agree to pay the
Bank the sum in U.S. Dollars as converted by
Visa U.S.A. The currency conversion rate used
on the conversion date may differ from the rate
in effect on the date you used your card. Transactions 
with a foreign merchant may or may not
involve a currency conversion. You agree to pay
the Bank a foreign transaction fee of two 
percent (2%) of the transaction amount for all
transaction where the merchant country is not
the United States, regardless of whether a 
currency conversion occurs. 

ILLEGAL TRANSACTIONS: 

You may not use your Credit Card for any illegal
transaction. 

SECURITY INTEREST: 

Collateral securing other loans with us, other 
than a dwelling used as your principal
residence, may also secure this Account. 

LOST CARDS: 

Though you may not be liable for the unauthorized 
use of your Card(s), you will immediately
notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized 
use as soon as it is known to you in order
to limit any potential loss. You will telephone us 
at 1-800-765-0853 to report any such occurrence. 


LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE 

If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card 
or a possible unauthorized use of your card, you
should write to us immediately at: 

7 

Customer Service, P.O. Box 31535, Tampa,
FL 33631-3535, or call us at 1-800-765-0853. 
You may also contact us on the Web via e-mail:
creditcard.servicing@iberiabank.com. You

be liable for unauthorized use that occurs 
before your notice to us. In any case, your liability 
will not exceed $50 [unless this account is 
for business use and 10 or more cards are 
issued to employees of your company in
which case there will be no limit on your
liability for unauthorized use]. You may have
no liability if certain conditions are met in accordance 
with the Visa Zero Liability program 
(contact us for details). 

CANCELLATION OF CREDIT 
AVAILABILITY AND CREATION OF NEW 
ACCOUNTS: 

We can cancel your Account any time, by 
phone or by writing you at the address shown
for you on our Account records. You can cancel
your Account by writing to us. Of course, if your
Account is canceled, you are required to pay
everything you owe us, including any amounts
that have not been billed to you yet. You are
also required to return all Card(s) we have given
you. In the event we cancel your Account, we
may offer to enter into a new contract with you
establishing a new Account to replace the one
we canceled. One method we may use to offer
you a new contract is to include a notice in your
monthly billing statement (i) advising you of the
cancellation of your existing Account, (ii) offering 
to enter into a new contract with you establishing 
a new Account which you can access
with your existing card, (iii) setting forth the
terms of the new contract (which may include
terms incorporated by reference from this or any
other agreement we have previously had with
you) and (iv) advising you that your use of the
card to purchase goods or services or obtain
cash after you have received the notice will 
constitute your agreement to the terms of the
new contract. You and we now agree that our
sending such a notice to you coupled with your
subsequent use of your credit card in the 
manner set forth in the notice will be one means 
by which we can form a valid, enforceable 
contract with one another on the terms set forth 
in the notice. 

DEFAULT: 

If you are in default, we may require you to pay 
the entire unpaid balance of your Account at
once. We may also cancel your right to charge 

8 

amounts to this Account. If we ask, you agree to

promptly cut in half and return to us all Credit

Card(s) and also any other Credit Access 
Devices we may have issued for your Account.

You will be in default if you do not make a

payment on time on this Account or any other

loan from us, if you go over the credit limit on

this Account or if you break any promises under 

any agreement with us. You will also be in 
default if you die, become bankrupt, give us

false information to get this Account or anything

happens that leads us to believe in good faith
that you will not pay us what you owe us or keep
your promises to us. You will also be in default if
the usual business of any persons or organization 
that must pay on this Account is suspended,

stopped or someone tries by legal process to
reorganize, liquidate or dissolve this business.
Copies of documents like Monthly Statements,

Sales Slips, Cash Advance forms and Loan 

Checks will be competent evidence before a

court to establish the amount you owe to us. We

will have no obligation to produce the originals. 

COLLECTION COSTS: 

If you default, you agree to pay our collection 
costs, including court costs and reasonable 
attorney�s fees. 

OTHERS USING YOUR ACCOUNT: 

You promise to pay for all Purchases and 

Advances made by anyone you authorize to use
your Account, whether or not you notify us that
they will be using it. If someone else is authorized 
to use your Account and you want to end

that person�s privilege, you must let us know in
writing. If he or she has a Card you must return
that Card with your written notice. 

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS: Keep this Document

responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. 

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your 
Statement 

If you think there is an error on your statement, 
write to us at: 

Customer Service, P.O. Box 31535, Tampa, FL
33631-3535. You may also contact us on the

Web via e-mail: 

creditcard.servicing@iberiabank.com. In 
your letter give us the following information: 

� 
Account information: Your name and 
account number. 

9 

� 
Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the 
suspected error. 
� 
Description of problem: If you think there
is an error on your bill, describe what
you believe is wrong and why you
believe it is a mistake. 
You must contact us: 

� Within 60 days after the error appeared 
on your statement. 

� 
At least 3 business days before an automated 
payment is scheduled, if you
want to stop payment on the amount you
think is wrong.

You must notify us of any potential errors in
writing or electronically via e-mail. You may call
us, but if you do we are not required to investigate 
any potential errors and you may have to
pay the amount in question. 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your 
Letter 
When we receive your letter, we must do two

things: 

1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we 
must tell you that we received your letter. We
will also tell you if we have already corrected
the error. 

2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we 
must either correct the error or explain to you
why we believe the bill is correct. 

While we investigate whether or not there 
has been an error: 

� 
We cannot try to collect the amount in
question, or report you as delinquent onthat amount. 

� 
The charge in question may remain on
your statement and we may continue to
charge you interest on that amount. 
� 
While you do not have to pay the 
amount in question, you are responsible
for the remainder of your balance. 

� 
We can apply any unpaid amount 
against your credit limit. 

After we finish our investigation, one of two
things will happen: 

� 
If we made a mistake: You will not have 
to pay the amount in question or any
interest or other fees related to that 
amount. 

� 
If we do not believe there was a mistake: 
You will have to pay the amount in question, 
along with the applicable interest 

10 

and fees. We will send you a statement of

the amount you owe and the date payment

is due. We may then report you as delin


quent if you do not pay the amount we

think you owe. 
If you receive our explanation but still believe
your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10
days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you
do so, we cannot report you as delinquent
without also reporting that you are questioning
your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone
to whom we reported you as delinquent and we
must let those organizations know when the
matter has been settled between us. If we do 
not follow all of the rules above, you do not have
to pay the first $50 of the amount you question
even if your bill is correct. 

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With 
Your Credit Card Purchases: 

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services
that you have purchased with your credit card
and you have tried in good faith to correct the
problem with the merchant, you may have the
right, not to pay the remaining amount due on
the purchase. To use this right, all of the following 
must be true: 

1. The purchase must have been made in your
home state or within 100 miles of your current
mailing address and the purchase price must
have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of
these are necessary if your purchase was
based on an advertisement we mailed to you,
or if we own the company that sold you the
goods or services.) 

2. You must have used your credit card for the
purchase. Purchases made with cash
advances from an ATM or with a check that 
accesses your credit card account do notqualify.

3. You must not yet have fully paid for the
purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are
still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in
writing or electronically at: 

IBERIABANK 
PO Box 31535, Tampa, FL 33631-3535
creditcard.servicing@iberiabank.com 

While we investigate, the same rules apply to

the disputed amount as discussed above. 
After we finish our investigation, we will tell you
our decision. At that point, if we think you owe
an amount and you do not pay, we may report
you as delinquent. 

11 

ARBITRATION: 

THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION LIMITS OUR 
RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN COURT AND 
YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. YOU 
SHOULD READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. 
Any claim, dispute, or controversy (a
�Dispute�) between you and us including without
limitation those related to this Cardmember 
Agreement, your Account, goods or services
purchased in whole or part by use of your 
Account or those relating to the validity,
enforceability or scope of this arbitration provision 
shall be resolved, upon the election of you
or us, by binding arbitration pursuant to this
arbitration provision and the Commercial 
Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the American 
Arbitration Association (AAA). This arbitration 
provision also applies to any Dispute
between you and any of our employees, our
affiliate companies and any of their employees.
This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a
transaction involving interstate commerce and
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
Act, 9 U.S.C. S1-16. The arbitrator shall apply
applicable substantive law consistent with the
Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes
of limitations and shall honor all claims of 
privilege recognized at law. This arbitration 
provision is fully binding in the event a class
action is filed in which you would be a class
representative or member. You and we agree
that arbitrations pursuant to this arbitration 
provision which involve you and us and/or us
and any other person cannot be consolidated.
You and we further agree that there shall be no
class action arbitration pursuant to this arbitration 
provision. This arbitration provision shall
survive the inactivation or termination of this 
Cardmember Agreement or your account. If any
portion of this arbitration provision is deemed
invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions 
are severable and enforceable to the 
fullest extent permitted by law. This arbitration
provision supersedes any prior arbitration provision 
that there may be between you and us. 

To Start Arbitration: Either you or we can start
arbitration any time a Dispute arises between
you and us. To start arbitration, you or we must 
contact the AAA at: 

American Arbitration Association 
13455 Noel Road 
Two Galleria Tower, Suite 1750 
Dallas, TX 75240-6636 

12 

For more information about the arbitration 
process, or to obtain a copy of the Commercial
Arbitration Rules and Procedures, contact the
AAA at 1-800-426-8792, or log onto their website at http://www.adr.org. 

No Waiver: You and we agree that bringing a
lawsuit, counterclaim, or other action in court 
shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to 
demand arbitration of any Dispute brought by 
the other party. As an example, and not by way 
of limitation, if we file a lawsuit against you in 
court to collect a debt and you file a counterclaim 
against us in that lawsuit, we have the 
right to demand that the entire Dispute, including 
our original lawsuit against you and your 
counterclaim against us, be arbitrated in accordance 
with this arbitration provision. You and 
we agree that bringing the lawsuit shall not 
operate as a waiver of our right to demand 
arbitration. 

Cost of Arbitration: If you start arbitration, you 
agree to pay the initial filing fee and deposit 
required by the AAA. If we start arbitration we 
will pay the filing fee and deposit. If you believe 
you are financially unable to pay such fees you 
may ask the AAA to defer or reduce such fees, 
pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules 
and Procedures. If the AAA does not defer or 
reduce such fees so that you are able to afford 
them we will, upon your written request, pay 
the fees, subject to any later allocation of the 
fees and expenses between you and us by the 
arbitrator. 

There may be other costs during the arbitration, 
such as attorney's fees, expenses of travel to 
the arbitration, and the costs of the arbitration 
hearings. The Commercial Arbitration Rules 
and Procedures determine who will pay those 
fees. 

Location of Arbitration: Any arbitration hearing 
will take place in the state in which you live 
unless you and we both agree to another 
location. 

Enforcement of Arbitration: After the arbitrator 
has made a decision, either you or we may take 
any legal action, including filing a lawsuit, to 
enforce the arbitrator's decision in any federal 
or state court that has jurisdiction. 

CHANGE OF ADDRESS: 

If you move, you must notify us of your new 
address as well as your new phone numbers in
writing. Please write them on the payment stub 
of your Monthly Statement so we can change 
our records. 

13 

AMENDMENT: 

We can amend this Agreement from time to 
time upon forty five days advance notice to you.
The new terms, including any increase or 
decrease in the fees, charges or periodic rate,
shall apply both to New Purchases and to New
Cash Advances made on and after the effective 
date. In case of any change in the periodic rate
or certain fees, the new fees, periodic rate and
APR will not be more than the maximum rate 
permitted by applicable law. 

ASSIGNMENT: 

We can assign this Agreement to others upon 
proper notification to you. You may not assign
this Agreement to others without our permission. 
IBERIABANK has in the past sold and
assigned all or part of its credit card portfolio to 
one or more financial institutions located in 
states other than Louisiana. At its sole discretion, 
IBERIABANK reserves the right to do so
again, and any such sale may include your
Account. IBERIABANK has also denied credit 
solely on the basis that the applicant previously
had an Account with IBERIABANK that was sold 
and assigned to another institution. In the event 
your Account is sold to another institution,
IBERIABANK reserves the right to deny your
application for another credit card on this basis.
In the event your Account is sold to another
institution, the purchaser may elect to offer you
Account terms and conditions which differ from 
those set forth in this Agreement and which may
include an Annual Percentage Rate which is
substantially higher than the Annual Percentage
Rate offered by IBERIABANK. The purchaser
may also offer you the option of rejecting the
new terms and conditions, but it is highly probable 
that your rejection of new terms and conditions 
offered by a purchaser would result in 
cancellation of your right to make purchases or
obtain cash advances with your card. In the 
event your card is canceled under these circumstances 
and your account was assessed an 
annual fee, IBERIABANK will refund a portion of
your annual fee. The amount of the refund will
be determined by multiplying the annual fee 
most recently charged to your Account by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days remaining in the one year period covered
by the fee and the denominator of which is 365.
It may be necessary for you to provide IBERIABANK 
with a written request for the refund, 
since IBERIABANK may not have access to 
records indicating who would be entitled to are
fund. In the event your card is canceled, you 

14 

will still be obligated to pay the existing
balance of your Account in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. 

APPLICABLE LAW: 

We are a bank (IBERIABANK) whose home 
state is Louisiana. Your Account and each 
advance of principal there under will be a 
loan made in Louisiana. Questions arising in 
connection with this Agreement or your
Account will be decided by, as applicable, (i) 
Louisiana law, (ii) any laws",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

each month.

Billing Rights:  Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided in your 
Credit Card Agreement.



This is your Consumer Credit Card Agreement (�Agreement�) with Cedar Hill National Bank (CHNB). This Agreement 
governs the use of your Cato Credit Card Account.    Your signature on the application indicates that you agree to comply 
with the terms in this Agreement.  The information about the  costs of the card described in this Agreement is accurate as 
of November, 2010.  This information may have changed after that date.  To find out what may have changed, write to us 
at CHNB, P.O. Box 34216, Charlotte, NC 28234-4216.

1.   AGREEMENT TERMS. The word Card  refers to  any credit cards issued to you or to an authorized user by Cedar Hill 
National Bank. The word Account  refers to  your Cato Credit Card Account. The words �you,� �your,� and �yours� refer to  
you, the Cardholder, and any person or persons who also are contractually liable under this Agreement. The words �we,� 
�us,� and �our� refer to Cedar Hill National Bank and any person or entity  to whom or to which this Agreement may be 
assigned. 
2.   ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT. The use of your Account or the Card by you or anyone whom you authorize or 
permit to use your Account or the Card means you accept this Agreement.  
3.   USE OF YOUR ACCOUNT AND THE CARD. You agree that you will only use your Account or the Card for personal, 
family, and  household  purposes. You may use your Account or the Card at any Cato, It�s Fashion, or It�s Fashion Metro 
store. Prior to use, each Card must be signed by the person to whom it is issued.
4.   PROMISE TO PAY. You agree to pay us in U.S. Dollars for all purchases, including applicable Interest Charges  and 
other charges or fees, incurred by you or anyone you authorize or permit to use your Account or the Card, even if you do 
not notify us that others are using your Account or the Card. All checks must be drawn on funds on deposit in the U.S. We 
can accept late payments or partial payments or checks and money orders marked �payment in full� without losing any of 
our rights under this agreement.
5.   INTEREST CHARGES. If the payments and credits in any billing period are less than the Previous Balance shown on 
your monthly statement for that period, Interest Charges will begin to accrue on the first day of that billing period.  Partial 
payments made on balances that were subject to a grace period will be credited as of the first day in the billing cycle. 
The Interest Charge will be computed as follows:  We will take the balance on your account at the beginning of each day 
of your billing period. To this beginning balance (including any unpaid Interest Charges and unpaid late fees) we will add 
any new purchases and fees and we will subtract any new payments and credits. This is the Daily Balance.
The Daily Balances for each day of the billing period are added together and divided by the number of days in the billing 
period. This gives us the Average Daily Balance.  To the Average Daily Balance, we will apply the monthly periodic rate of 
1.9083% (Corresponding annual percentage rate 22.9%) to determine the Interest Charge.
6. A MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE.  We will charge you a minimum Interest Charge of $1 for any Billing Cycle in 
which an Interest Charge of less than $1 could otherwise be charged.
7. MONTHLY STATEMENTS; BILLING CYCLES. We will send you a statement after each monthly Billing Cycle in 
which you have a debit or credit balance, an Interest Charge is imposed, or applicable law requires us to send a 
Statement. The Statement will show the Previous Balance, Payments and Credits, Purchases, Interest Charges, other 
Fees and Charges, Payment Due Date, New Balance and Minimum Payment Due. Purchases will be identified by the 
amount and date of the transaction, and an abbreviated merchandise description.  A Billing Cycle means the days 
between Statement Closing Dates.
8. METHODS OF PAYMENT.   You may at any time pay the entire New Balance shown on your billing statement, but 
each month you must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due.  All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the 
address shown on your monthly billing statement.  All payments will be applied in the following order:  Interest Charges  
and other charges or fees, insurance premiums, if any, and purchases in the order made. 
9. MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT. If your �New Balance� is  $200 or less, your minimum monthly payment is $10.00 or 
the balance whichever is less.   If your account balance is greater than  $200, the minimum monthly payment is 5% of the 
New Balance  The minimum payment will include any past due amounts or payment shortfalls rounded up to the next 
highest dollar. 
10. CREDIT LIMIT.  We may increase or decrease your available  credit from time to time.  We have the right at any time 
to limit or terminate the use of your Account without giving you notice in advance, unless we are required to give you 
notice by law.  If you exceed or attempt to exceed your line of credit, you may be declared in default.
11. CREDIT BALANCES. We will refund any credit balance within seven business days from receipt of your written 
request mailed to us at CHNB, P.O. Box 34216, Charlotte, NC 28234-4216.
12. GRACE PERIOD.  You will have a grace period of  at least 28 days from your closing date in which to pay your 
balance in full each month.  If the balance on your account is paid in full within this grace period, no Interest Charge will 
be added to your account. 
13. LATE PAYMENT FEE. A  Late Payment  Fee of up to $20.00 will be added to your account for each billing period in   
which you fail to make a minimum payment within 10 days after your payment due date. If you do not make at least the 
Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date each month, you will be in default.
14. RETURNED PAYMENT FEE. A Returned Payment Fee of up to $25.00 will be assessed on accounts, as permitted 
by law, whenever a check or other payment device presented on an account is returned to us unpaid by your bank or 
financial institution. 
15. PAY BY PHONE FEE.  Each time you ask a customer service representative to assist you in making an expedited 
automated payment from your bank account, we may add a service fee to the balance of your account if permitted by 
applicable law.   The amount of the fee will be disclosed at the time you request this optional payment service. 
16. DEFAULT/COLLECTION COSTS. If you fail to comply with the terms of  this Agreement including failing to make 
required payment when due,  if you declare bankruptcy, or if you die, it will be a default subject to any restrictions under 
applicable law.  If that happens, we may tell you to pay us immediately everything you owe under the Account and 
applicable law.  We will tell you in advance and/or give you an opportunity to cure your default only if applicable law 
requires us to do so.  If you are in default and we refer the collection on your Account to an attorney, we may charge to 
you reasonable attorney�s fees and court or other collection costs as permitted by law.
17. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or a possible unauthorized 
use of your card, you should write to us immediately at:  CHNB, P.O. Box 34216, Charlotte, NC 28234-4216, or call us at 
877-557-3526.  You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us.  You may, however, be 
liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us.  In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.
18. CHANGE OF TERMS. We may change any term or part of this AGREEMENT, including Interest Charge rates, fees 
or the method of computing any balance upon which the Interest Charge rate is assessed.  We will give you notice of any 
change as required by applicable law.   Your express written agreement to such change or  the use of your Account or the 
Card on or after the effective date of the change means that you accept and agree to the change. We have the right to 
change your terms, rates, and fees at any time, for any reason, in accordance with the credit card agreement and 
applicable law.
19. CREDIT AUTHORIZATION. Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked to provide 
identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have 
sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if this occurs.
20. CREDIT INVESTIGATION AND REPORTING. You authorize us to investigate and verify your credit, employment 
and income records.  You understand and agree that we may request a consumer report from a consumer reporting 
agency in considering your Application for this Account and later in connection with updates, renewals, extensions of 
credit, or to collect amounts owed on your Account.  Upon your request we will tell you whether a consumer report was 
requested and the name and address of any consumer reporting agency that furnished the report.  You agree we may 
report your performance under this Agreement to consumer reporting agencies and others who may properly receive the 
information.  If you believe we have reported inaccurate information about you to a consumer reporting agency, please 
contact us at CHNB, P.O. Box 34216, Charlotte, NC 28234-4216.  When you notify us, provide your name, address, Cato 
Account Number and identify the inaccurate information and tell us why you believe it is inaccurate.  If you have a copy of 
the credit report that includes the inaccurate information, please send a copy of that report to us as well. 
21. PHONE CALLS.  You authorize us or our servicers, assignees, or third party debt collectors to contact you by

Your Billing Rights: Keep this Document for Future Use
This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement
If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:
Cedar Hill National Bank
PO Box 34216
Charlotte, NC 28234-4216

In your letter, give us the following information:
* Account information: Your name and account number.
* Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
* Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us:
* Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
* At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing.  You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter.  We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
* We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
* The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
* While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
* We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
* If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
* If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees.  We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due.  We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days  telling us that you still refuse to pay.  If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill.  We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct. 
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right to not pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.  To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50.  (Note:  Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase.  Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at:
Cedar Hill National Bank
PO Box 34216, Charlotte, NC 28234-4216
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above.  After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision.  At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

VISA CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT

IN THIS AGREEMENT THE WORDS ""YOU"" AND ""YOUR"" MEAN EACH AND ALL OF THOSE WHO APPLY FOR OR USE THE CARD. ""CARD"" MEANS THE VISA CREDIT CARD AND ANY DUPLICATES AND RENEWALS WE ISSUE. EVERYONE WHO RECEIVES, SIGNS OR USES A CARD ISSUED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE A MEMBER OF THIS CREDIT UNION. BY SIGNING OR USING THE CARD, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THE ACCOUNT AND PROMISE TO PAY ALL AMOUNTS DUE. ""ACCOUNT"" MEANS YOUR VISA CREDIT CARD LINE OF CREDIT ACCOUNT WITH US. ""WE"", ""US"" AND ""OURS"" MEANS THIS CREDIT UNION.

1. SECURITY: YOU SPECIFICALLY GRANT US A CONSENSUAL SECURITY INTEREST IN ALL INDIVIDUAL AND JOINT ACCOUNTS YOU HAVE WITH US NOW AND IN THE FUTURE TO SECURE REPAYMENT OF CREDIT EXTENDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. YOU ALSO AGREE THAT WE HAVE SIMILAR STATUTORY LIEN RIGHTS UNDER STATE AND/OR FEDERAL LAW. THE GRANTING OF THIS SECURITY INTEREST IS A CONDITION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF CREDIT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE IN DEFAULT, WE CAN APPLY YOUR SHARES TO THE AMOUNT YOU OWE. Shares and deposits in an Individual Retirement Account or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given are not subject to this security interest. If you have other loans with us, collateral securing such loans may also secure your obligations under this Agreement, unless that other collateral is your principal residence or non-purchase money household goods.

2. Using Your Card. You may use your Card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept VISA Cards. However, you may not use your Card to initiate any type of gambling or wagering transactions that are in violation of applicable law. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union and from other financial institutions that accept VISA Cards, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept VISA Cards.) To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the Personal Identification Number (PIN) that is issued to you for use with your Card. You agree that you will not use your Card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state or local law. If use of your PIN constitutes an Electronic Funds Transfer, the terms and conditions of your EFT Agreement may also effect your rights.

3. Responsibility. You agree to pay all charges (purchases and cash advances) to your Account that are made by you or anyone whom you authorize to use your Account. You also agree to pay all interest charges and other charges added to your Account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint Account, Section 14 below also applies to your Account.

4. Interest Charges. The balances subject to the periodic Interest Charge are the average daily transactions balances outstanding during the month (new and previous). To get the average daily balance, we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases, cash advances, insurance premiums, debit adjustments or other charges and subtract any payments, credits and unpaid Interest Charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. The Interest Charge for a billing cycle is computed by multiplying the average daily balance subject to a Interest Charge by the Daily Periodic Rate times the number of days in the billing cycles. You can avoid Interest Charges on purchases by paying the full amount of the entire balance owed each month within 25 days of your statement closing date. Otherwise, the new balance of purchases, and subsequent purchases from the date they are posted to your Account, will be subject to a Interest Charge. Cash advances are always subject to a Interest Charge from the later of the date they are posted to your Account or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your Account.

5. Other Charges. You promise to pay all fees disclosed to you on the Truth-in-Lending Statement, such as late payment fees, over-the-credit-limit fees, and other fees.

6. Payments. Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the due date specified on the statement. If your statement says the payment is ""Now Due,"" your payment is due no later than twenty-five (25) days from the statement closing date or 21 days from the date we mail or deliver the statement, whichever is later. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the Total New Balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 3% of your Total New Balance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, and any amount you are over your credit limit. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit.

7. Default. You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any
false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full Account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying interest charges, at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any deposits that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe.

8. If Your Card is Lost or Stolen or if an Unauthorized Use Occurs. You agree to notify us immediately if your card is ever lost or stolen or if an unauthorized use may have occurred. The telephone number to call is (888) 213-2848, and you agree to follow up the call with notice in writing to us at: 718 E. Michigan Avenue, Jackson, Michigan 49201. You also agree to assist us in determining the facts, circumstances and other pertinent information relating to any loss, theft or possible unauthorized use of your card and comply with such procedures as we may require in connection with our investigation, including filing a police report and otherwise assisting in the
prosecution of any unauthorized user. You will be liable for any unauthorized use over the Visa Network only if we can prove that you were grossly negligent in your use or handling of your card, or if we can prove that you used the card fraudulently. Your liability for unauthorized use on networks other than the Visa Network will not exceed $50.00. In any case, you will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use.

9. Change of Terms. The Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement from time to time subject to applicable law. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing Account balance as well as to future transactions.

10. Returns and Adjustments. Merchants and others who honor your Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your Account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1 or more, it will be refunded upon your written or verbal request.

11. Additional Benefits/Card Enhancements. The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your Account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit Union is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.

12. Foreign Transactions; Currency Conversion. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. Transactions processed outside of the United States will be charged a foreign transaction fee in an amount to be determined by the Credit Union,
regardless of whether there is a currency conversion associated with the transaction. The conversion rate in dollars will be a rate selected by VISA from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date in each instance. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the U.S., Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands; this may include internet transactions.

13. Plan Merchant Disputes. We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor your card. Also, we are not responsible for goods or services you purchase with the card unless (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement we sent or participated in sending you; (b) your purchase cost $50.00 or more and was made from a plan merchant in your state or within 100 miles of your home; and you have made a good faith attempt, but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant. You must resolve all other disputes directly with the plan merchant.

14. Joint Accounts. If this is a joint Account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may terminate the Account and the termination will be effective as to all of you, but both of you will still be responsible for repayment all amounts owing.

15. Effect of Agreement. This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your Account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.

16. Transaction Slips. Your monthly statement will identify that merchant, electronic terminal or financial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement.

By using your Greylock Federal Credit Union Visa credit card (�Card�), you agree to the following terms and conditions, the terms and conditions disclosed on the Visa Credit Card Application (�Visa Application�) and any future amendments to this Credit Cardholder Agreement (this �Agreement�). 

This Agreement describes the terms and conditions of the Card offered by Greylock Federal Credit Union (�Greylock�).  In this Agreement, �you,� �your� and �Borrower� mean each person who signs the Application (the �Application�) or otherwise agrees to its terms in writing (member and non-member co-applicants). �Greylock,� �we,� �our� and �us� mean Greylock or anyone to whom Greylock transfers its rights under this Agreement.

Change in terms
We can change the terms of your account as permissible by law.  We will provide you with such notice as is required by law by mailing a notice to you at the latest address shown in our records.  You have the right to reject certain changes but must notify us at 1-800-207-5555 or write to us at Greylock Federal Credit Union, 150 West Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201.  The letter should include your name, address, phone number and account number.   If you reject any changes, we will close your Visa account.  Use of your card after receiving notice of a change will indicate your agreement to the change.

Change of name, address, telephone
You agree to notify us in writing if you change your name, your home address, or telephone number.

Other agreements
Use of the Card is subject to the terms of existing Visa USA regulations governing your Greylock Visa and any future changes to those regulations.

Agreement to Pay
Each person who signed the Visa Application is individually or jointly and severally liable for any credit extended pursuant to this Agreement.  You agree to pay any charges, interest and fees made on this account.

Single and Joint credit
By signing the Visa Application, you and any co-borrower each authorize the other to individually request, authorize or receive advances on the account. You will remain jointly and severally liable for any advance under this Agreement even if you did not specifically request a particular advance and/or did not receive any benefit from the advance. If you do not wish for any further advances to be made under this Agreement, you may close your Visa account. If you do not want the co-borrower to be able to request any further advances, you may close your Visa account. Any one of you may close the Visa, but both of you will remain jointly and severally obligated to repay the outstanding balance of all pre-existing advances under the terms of this Agreement.

USING THE CARD
Illegal transactions
Greylock prohibits the use of your Card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state or local law. Internet gambling may be illegal in some jurisdictions. Regardless of whether the transaction is deemed legal or illegal, you agree to repay, according to the terms of this Agreement, transactions you initiate by use of your Card.

Credit limit
If we approve your request for a Card, we will establish a credit limit for that Card. You agree not to attempt to exceed the credit limit. If you temporarily exceed your credit limit, your credit limit will not be increased and you agree to immediately repay the excess amount. We can increase or decrease your credit limit at our discretion. We will notify you in writing if the amount of your credit limit goes up or down. We may suspend your credit limit or otherwise terminate your ability to use your Card. We may do this at any time and for any reason. Your obligations under this Agreement continue even after we have done this. 

Uses for your Card
You will be able to use your card to buy goods and services any place Visa credit cards are honored. You can use your card to obtain a cash advance at any Greylock branch or other financial institution that accepts Visa cards. You can also use your Visa card together with your Personal Identification Number (PIN) to obtain cash advances from any Automated Teller Machine (ATM) displaying the Visa logo or to make purchases at any designated point-of-sale (POS) machine. For your protection, keep your PIN safe and confidential at all times. Do not write your PIN on your card or anything that is kept with your card.

Limits on obtaining cash
You may not obtain cash in excess of your available credit. An ATM owner may impose its own limits and, for security reasons, Greylock or other provider of funds may have additional transaction limits. At Greylock ATM machines, you may obtain cash advances against your Visa up to a maximum aggregate 
total of $500 per 24-hour period provided sufficient credit is available.

Internet transactions & Verified by Visa program
If you use your Card for online shopping, we recommend that you enroll in the Verified by Visa Program, as long as it is offered by Visa USA. This program is designed to reduce identity theft by allowing you to establish a password to use whenever you use your existing Card for online transactions. 


PAYMENTS and FEES
Minimum monthly payments
Your Statement will provide instructions for making payments, including the amounts due and the due dates for receiving your payments.  If applicable, your Statement will also include a minimum payment amount.  To avoid a late payment fee, you must pay us at least this minimum payment amount by the due date provided in the Statement.  If you have agreed to incur fees for going over your credit limit, be aware that paying only the minimum payment amount might not be enough to avoid an overlimit fee.

Application of payments
All payments in excess of the minimum monthly payments will be applied as follows; first to the balance with the highest interest rate, and then to each successive balance with the next highest interest rate, until the payment is exhausted.

Method of payment
You may pay by check using the remittance coupon on your statement, by automatic payment from your Greylock  checking account or by signing on to eZCardInfo.com to make an online payment from any checking account or bill payment account you have with a financial institution. 

Credit and posting rules
Payments received no later than close of business on any business day will be credited to your account effective on that day. Transactions after the close of business will be posted on the next business day. If your due date occurs on a day on which we do not receive payments, any payments received the next day will not be treated as late.   All payments are subject to verification and collection by Greylock.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS/REQUIREMENTS
Promotional programs
At our option a special promotional rate may be offered from time to time.  The specific terms will be provided at the time of the offer. Generally, a promotional APR will apply only to selected transactions during the promotional period.

Collection costs and attorney fees
If you are in default of your payments or break a promise under this Agreement, you agree to pay all collection costs incurred by us, including collection agency costs, court fees and reasonable attorney�s fees (either hourly or contingency fees, which shall be deemed reasonable). These provisions apply to bankruptcy appeals and post-judgment proceedings.

Waiver/ Severability
The failure of Greylock to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or any other right available hereunder.

 YOUR BILLING RIGHTS
(KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE)
This Notice contains important information about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.
Notify Us In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill.
If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write us, on a separate sheet, at Greylock Federal Credit Union, 150 West St, Pittsfield, MA 01201 Attention: Credit Card Operations.
Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights.
In your letter, give us the following information:
� Your name and account number.
� The dollar amount of the suspected error.
� Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.
If you have authorized us to pay your credit card bill automatically from your savings or checking account, you can stop the payment on any amount you think is wrong. To stop the payment your letter must reach us three business days before the automatic payment is scheduled to occur. 

Your Rights and Our Responsibilities After We Receive Your Written Notice
We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill was correct.
After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for the amount you question, including finance charges, and we can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we didn't make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due.
If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within ten days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. And, we must tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is.
If we don't follow these rules, we can't collect the first $50 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct.

Special Rules for Credit Card Purchases
If you have a problem with the quality of property or services that you purchased with a credit card and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or services. There are two limitations on this right:
(a) You must have made the purchase in your home state or, if not within your home state, within 100 miles of your current mailing address; and
(b) The purchase price must have been more than $50.
These limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant, or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or services.

   *How we will Calculate your Balance: We use a Method called ""Average Daily Balance (Including New Purchases)""






Billing Rights Notice:  Billing Rights information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided in the Greylock Federal Credit Union Credit Cardholder Agreement.


1) At the date this was printed (shown in the lower right-hand corner) the information listed above was accurate. Because rates and terms are subject to
change, you may contact us for the current information by writing to our business address 150 West St. Pittsfield, MA 01201 or call 1-413-236-4000.

2) A Finance Charge will be imposed on credit purchases only if you elect not to pay the entire New Balance shown on your monthly statement by the Payment Due Date.  If you elect not to pay the entire New Balance shown on your monthly statement by the Payment Due Date, a Finance Charge will be imposed on the average daily balance of the unpaid purchases from the previous statement closing date and on new purchases from the date of posting to your account during the current billing cycle, and will continue to accrue until the closing date of the billing cycle preceding the date on which the entire New Balance is paid in full or until the date of payment if more than 25 days from the closing date.  The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying a monthly Periodic Rate to the average daily balance of purchases.  To get the average daily balance, we take the outstanding unpaid balance of purchases at the beginning of the billing cycle, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid finance charges to get the daily balance; we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide by the total number of days in the billing cycle.  A finance charge will be assessed on cash advances/balance transfers from the date you obtained the cash advance/balance transfers, or the first day of the billing cycle in which it is posted to your account, whichever is later, and will continue to accrue until paid in full.  The Finance Charge on cash advances/balance transfers will be calculated in the same manner as explained above for purchases.  

3) The monthly Periodic Rate for Classic and Gold cards is 1.12333% and 0.91333% for Platinum cards.

4) International Service Assessment (ISA) Fee or Other Fees: Effective April 2, 2008, Visa implemented an international Service Assessment (ISA) of .08 percent  for single-currency international transactions. Visa will also continue to apply the existing ISA fee of 1.0 percent for multi-currency international transactions. Visa assesses an International Service Assessment (ISA) charges to the issuer which is passed on the member and collected through settlement he current ISA is applied to all cross-border transactions (purchases, credit vouchers and cash distributions) where currency conversion is performed.

Use of the word �card� in its singular form may also refer to the plural. The word �card� also means your Share Secured MasterCard� credit card and duplicates of said card. The word �account� means your Share Secured MasterCard� credit card revolving credit account with Keesler Federal Credit Union (the �Credit Union�). 
1. 
You have applied for a Share Secured line of credit that you can use from time to time and which may be replenished by payment on amounts previously drawn. 

2. 
This Agreement establishes your request for the issuance of a Share Secured credit card. The credit limit approved shall be determined by the amount of money deposited into an interest bearing holding account with Keesler Federal Credit Union, and this credit limit will be drawn upon as you utilize an issued credit card. The interest bearing holding account will earn the lowest tiered dividend rate regardless of balance. 

3. 
A FINANCE CHARGE (interest) will be charged on any outstanding purchase balance that is not repaid within the allowable 25-day grace period established by the Credit Union. The FINANCE CHARGE for the Share Secured Standard MasterCard� is a 1.077% monthly periodic rate, which equates to a 12.9% ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. The Balance Calculation Method used by the Credit Union is the �average daily balance� method including current transactions. 

4. 
The Credit Union reserves the right to change the rate of the FINANCE CHARGE upon giving notice required by law.

6. If you select convenience checks, the following would apply: 
� Convenience checks when written are considered cash 
advances and would be assessed the stated cash advance fee per check.

7. 
The minimum periodic payment required is the total new balance as shown on your monthly account statement if the amount is under $10.00.

You also agree that if the Share Secured credit card becomes more than 60 days delinquent the Credit Union has the right to close the credit card and apply the secured money to pay off the credit card and that you are responsible for any outstanding balance. 

11. 
You understand and agree that the Credit Union has the authority to impress and enforce a statutory lien on all present and future shares in your name to the extent of that portion of 

the loan balance, which may be in default, including cost of collection and reasonable attorneys� fees. Further you hereby expressly agree and consent that the Credit Union may apply such shares in payment of that portion of the loan balance which may be in default under this Agreement which may include a FINANCE CHARGE, including other charges, and that such application may be pursuant to such a pledge or as a right of offset, and can be exercised without further notice to you. If you have any loans with the Credit Union, or take out other loans in the future, collateral securing those loans will also secure your obligations under this Agreement. However, unless you expressly agree otherwise, your primary dwelling will not secure your obligation under this Agreement even if the Credit Union has or later acquires a mortgage on the dwelling. 

12. 
As a holder of a credit card, you understand that you can repay any outstanding balance prior to maturity in whole or part at your option without penalty. 

13.

16. 
You acknowledge and agree that the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement under the following conditions:

17. 
If your share secured line of credit is terminated by the Credit Union, you shall receive written notice of such termination, however, you understand and acknowledge that such termination shall not affect your obligation to pay any outstanding balance. 

18. 
You understand that the Credit Union�s Board of Directors may require that your loan file be reviewed periodically, and you hereby give your permission and authorize the Credit Union to investigate and reassess your creditworthiness. 

19. 
You understand that the Credit Union may require a 

reverification and approval if: (a) the credit limit is increased or (b) the terms of payment are extended beyond the terms of the original Agreement. 

20. 
You fully understand, acknowledge and agree that if any loans become delinquent or past due, your credit card shall be revoked unless the Credit Union determines that extenuating circumstances have contributed to the delinquency. Under such circumstances, the Credit Union may approve your continued use of the credit card.

FINANCE CHARGE CALCULATION METHODS The FINANCE CHARGE Calculation Method applicable to your account for Cash Advances and Credit Purchases of Goods and Services that you obtain through the use of your credit card is specified below: 
METHOD F-To avoid incurring an additional FINANCE CHARGE on the balance of Cash Advances (and Credit Purchases, if this Method F is specified as applicable to Credit Purchases) reflected on your statement on or before the Payment Due Date the FINANCE CHARGES for a billing cycle are computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (and, if applicable Credit Purchases), which is determined by dividing the sum of the Daily Balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle, plus applicable Cash Advance Fees. Each daily balance of Cash Advances (and if applicable, Credit Purchases) is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Cash Advances (and, if applicable, Credit Purchases), any new Cash Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing cycle in which posted, whichever is later, (and, if applicable, any new Credit Purchases as posted) and subtracting any payments as received and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid FINANCE CHARGE. 
METHOD G � To avoid incurring an additional FINANCE CHARGE on the balance of Credit Purchases (and Cash Advances, if this Method G is specified as applicable to Cash Advances) reflected on your statement and on any new Credit Purchases (and, if applicable, Cash Advances) appearing on your next statement, you must pay the New Balance shown on your statement on or before the Payment Due Date. 
The FINANCE CHARGES for a billing cycle are computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the Average Daily Balance of Credit Purchases (and, if applicable, Cash Advances), which is determined by dividing the sum of daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Each daily balance is determined by adding to the Previous Balance of Credit Purchases (and, if applicable, Cash Advances) any new Credit Purchases posted to your account (and, if applicable, any new Cash Advances as of the transaction date or the first day of the billing in which posted, whichever is later) and subtracting any payments as received and credit as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid FINANCE CHARGE. 
MASTERCARD� LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORI ZED USE You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify: PSCU SERVICE CENTERS, INC. at P.O. Box 31216, Tampa, Florida 33631, 1-800-449-7728 or in writing, of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00. 
YOUR BILLING RIGHTS 
KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE This notice contains important information about your rights and our responsibility under the Fair Credit Billing Act. 
NOTIFY US IN CASE OF ERRORS OR QUESTIONS 
ABOUT YOUR BILL If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet at the address listed on your bill. Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60-days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. Your letter needs to include the following information: 
� 
Your Name 

� 
Credit card number 

� 
Dollar amount of the suspected error 

�

YOUR RIGHTS AND OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AFTER 
WE RECEIVE YOUR WRITTEN NOTICE: We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill is correct. 
After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for the amount you question, including finance charges, and we can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. 
If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we didn�t make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date it is due. 
If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within ten days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. 
And, we must tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is. 
If we don�t follow these rules, we can�t collect the first $50 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct.

Visa Credit Card Line of Credit Account. The amount of any Visa
Convenience Check paid by us is posted as a Cash Advance under
your Account.
2. How to Use This Account: You can purchase or lease
goods and services (�purchases�) from a merchant up to your
maximum credit limit by presenting your Card and signing a sales
slip for the amount of the purchase. You may also use your Card:
(a) To obtain Cash Advances up to your maximum credit limit
from financial institutions that accept a Visa Credit Card;
(b) By use of pre-printed Visa Convenience Checks that we
may issue you from time to time;
(c) By making withdrawals with your Card at an ATM or other

your maximum credit limit by automatic transfer of funds directly
into your predesignated Checking Account(s) in multiples of $100.
The fee for each transfer is $7.00.
3. Responsibility. Both the Business and the Business Owners
are jointly and severally liable to pay all Advances under the
Account plus FINANCE CHARGES arising from the authorized
use of the Card, a Visa Convenience Check and the Card account.
For example, the Business is responsible for charges made by
yourself, your spouse and minor children. The Business is also
responsible for charges made by anyone else to whom the Card is
given, and this responsibility continues until the Card is recovered.
The Business cannot disclaim responsibility by notifying us, but
we will close the Account for new transactions, if you so request,
when you return all Cards and any issued but unused Visa
Convenience Checks. The obligation to pay the Account balance
continues even though an agreement, divorce decree, or other court
judgment, to which we are not a party, may direct other persons
responsible to pay the Account.
4. Liability for Unauthorized Use. Notify us immediately in
the event the account card is lost or stolen or upon discovery of a
transaction which is the result of fraudulent activity such as the
unauthorized use of the account or the card. We reserve the right
to impose liability on the Business, if we determine that the
Business or cardholder was negligent in the handling of the
account or card.
5. Lost Card Notification. To report lost or stolen Visa�
Credit Cards 24 hours a day call 800.847.2911. To report lost or
stolen cards during normal business hours call 330.372.8100,
330.677.0001, 330.492.1106 or 800.775.7741.
6. Credit Line: If we approve the application, we will
establish a self-replenishing Line of Credit and notify the Business
of its amount when we issue the Card. You agree not to let the
Account balance exceed this approved credit line. Each payment
made on the Account will restore your credit line by the amount of
the payment which is applied to the principal balance owed on the
Account. The Business may request an increase in the credit line
which must be approved by us. By giving written notice, we may
reduce the credit line from time to time, or with good cause, revoke
the Card and terminate this Agreement. Good cause includes
failure to comply with this Agreement, or our adverse reevaluation
of the credit worthiness. The Business may also terminate this
Agreement at any time, but termination by either of us does not
affect the obligation to pay the Account balance. The Card
remains our property and you must recover and surrender to us all
Cards, and any issued but unused Visa Convenience Checks, upon
our request and upon termination of this Agreement.
7. Credit Information. The Business authorize us to
investigate their credit standing when opening, renewing or
reviewing the Account, and the Business authorizes us to disclose
information regarding the Account to credit bureaus and other
creditors who inquire of us about your credit standing, to the extent
authorized by our BYLAWS.
8. Payments. We will mail you a statement every month
showing your previous balance comprised of purchases and Cash
Advances, the current transactions on your Account, the remaining
credit available under your credit limit, the new balance of
purchases and Cash Advances, the total new balance, the
FINANCE CHARGE due to date, and the minimum payment
required. Each month the Business must pay at least the minimum
payment shown on the statement by the date specified on the
statement or no later than 25 days from the statement closing date,
which ever is later. If the statement says the payment is �Now
Due,� the payment is due no later than 25 days from the statement
closing date. The Business may pay more frequently, pay more
than the minimum payment or pay the Total New Balance in full.
If the Business makes extra or larger payments, the Business is still
required to make at least the minimum payment each month the
Account has a balance (other than a credit balance).
Payment checks must be drawn on a financial institution or
other entity domiciled in the United States. Otherwise, posting of
the payment may be delayed if presentment of a check is drawn on
a non-United States domiciled financial institution or entity. The
payment will not be credited to the account until the funds have
been collected in United States dollars. The Business also agrees
to allow the Credit Union to debit the account for any collection in
processing fees associated with handling this payment.
The minimum payment will be two percent (2.0%) of the total
new balance or $10 or the total new balance, if it is less than Ten
Dollars ($10) plus any portion of the minimum payment(s) shown
on prior statement(s) which remain unpaid.
We have the right to demand immediate payment of any
amount by which you are over your credit limit.
We will apply your minimum payment first to the FINANCE
CHARGE on Balance Transfers, Cash Advances and purchases,
then to fees, then to the principal balances of purchases in the order
they were posted to your Account, and then to the principal
balance of cash advances. Any amount in excess of the minimum
payment will be applied to the balance with the highest ANNUAL
PERCENTAGE RATE.
9. FINANCE CHARGES. You can avoid a FINANCE
CHARGE on purchases by paying the full amount of the New
Balance of purchases each month within 25 days of your statement
closing date. Otherwise, any unpaid New Balances of purchases
and subsequent purchases from the date they are posted to your
Account will be subject to FINANCE CHARGES. Cash advances,
which include the amount of any Visa convenience checks or
balance transfers posted to your account, are always subject to
FINANCE CHARGES from the date they are posted to your
Account.
In addition to the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE a
transaction fee of 3% of the advance for each cash advance will be
charged.
See Rate Addendum for rates regarding your account.
Any increase in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will take
the form of additional payments shown as total minimum
payments on the statement.
The following information is applicable to each of our VISA�
Credit Card Line of Credit Accounts:
The principal balances of purchases and Cash Advances are
determined each day during the statement period, beginning with
the principal portion of your previous balances, reduced by
payments made and credits we apply, and increased by purchases
and Cash Advances made and debit adjustments we make during
the statement period. The daily principal balances are totaled and
divided by the number of days in the statement period, to produce
separate average daily principal balances for purchases and Cash
Advances to which the periodic rate is then applied.
10. Default. The Business will be in default if it fails to make
any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that
it is due. The Business will be in default if it breaks any promise
made under this Agreement. The Business will be in default if it
files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, that is, unable to pay the
obligations when they become due. The Business will be in
default if it makes any false or misleading statements in any credit
application or update of credit information. The Business will be
in default if something happens which we believe may
substantially reduce the Business� ability to repay what it owes.
When in default we can demand immediate payment of the entire
amount owed under this Agreement without giving you advance
notice. If immediate payment is demanded, the Business will
continue to pay interest, at the applicable interest rates in effect
under this Agreement, until what is owed has been repaid. If
demand for immediate payment has been made, the shares and
deposits given as security for payment under this Agreement can
be applied towards what is owed. We may also take appropriate
action as authorized under the Uniform Commercial Code to
repossess any and all collateral pledged to secure repayment under
this Agreement. To the extent permitted by law, the Business will
also be required to pay our collection expenses, including court
costs and reasonable attorneys� fees. We can also exercise any
other rights given by law when the Business is in default.
11. Using the Card. You may use the actual Card, Account
number and/or PIN to make transactions. You will retain the
copies of the transaction slips furnished to you in order to verify
your monthly statement.
12. Returns and Adjustments. Merchants and others who
honor the Card may give credit or returns or adjustments, and they
will do so by sending us a credit slip, which we will post to your
Account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe us,
we will hold and apply this credit balance toward future purchases
and Cash Advances, or if it is one dollar or more, refund it on
written request or automatically after six months.
13. Using Visa Convenience Checks. You may use your Visa
Convenience Checks, if available, as you would use your Card to
obtain a Cash Advance or to make a purchase or payment. Your
Visa Convenience Checks directly access your Account. All
purchases, payments and Advances made with a Visa Convenience
Check and paid by us are treated as Cash Advances hereunder and,
except as otherwise indicated, are subject to all terms of this
Agreement pertaining to Cash Advances and to the following
additional terms:
A. No Visa Convenience Check may be used to make a
payment on your Account.
B. Only the person whose name appears on a Visa
Convenience Check may use them.
C. Visa Convenience Checks must be written in U.S. Dollars
in an amount not less than $100. Visa Convenience Checks
may not be certified.
D. We may return a Visa Convenience Check unpaid if there is
not enough available credit on your Account to pay it, if
your Account is in default, or if your Card or any Visa
Convenience Checks have been reported lost or stolen.
E. If you are issued checks to access your account and you
stop payment on a check, your account will be charged $35
for each stop payment.
14. Foreign Transactions. Purchases and Cash Advances
made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed as a
rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale
currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which
rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or the
government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central
processing date; in each instance, plus or minus any adjustment
determined by the Issuer. The adjustment may show as a separate
entry on your account. You are blocked from using your card in
Cyprus, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nigeria,
Saudi Arabia, Spain, Tunisia and Turkey.
15. Merchant Disputes. We are not responsible for the refusal
of any merchant or financial institution to honor your Card, or Visa
Convenience Checks. Except with respect to purchases made with
a Visa Convenience Check, we are subject to claims and defenses
(other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you
purchase with the Card only if you have made a good faith attempt,
but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant, and:
(a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement we
sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost
more than Fifty Dollars ($50) and was made from a merchant in
your state or within one hundred (100) miles of your home. Any
other disputes you must resolve directly with such merchant.

Business� overdraft protection plan for SSCU Checking Account.

within which the Business must pay the New Balance Total in
order to completely avoid FINANCE CHARGES on purchases. A
minimum payment will be due in the month following the month
in which you skip your payment.
19. Effective Agreement. This Agreement is a contract which
applies to all transactions on your Account, even though the sales,
Cash Advances, credits or other slips you sign or receive, may
contain different terms. We may amend this Agreement from time
to time by sending you advance written notice as required by law.
Your use of the Card, or Visa Convenience Check, thereafter will
indicate your agreement to any such amendment. To the extent the

will apply to your existing Account balance as well as to future
transactions. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Ohio and relevant Federal Laws.
20. Security Interest. You agree that the Credit Union has a
security interest in the account as identified in the Credit Card
Application. Further, the Business agrees that future funds
deposited in that account are also subject to the Credit Union�s
security interest. In no event shall the Credit Union take a security
interest in Individual Retirement Accounts or other accounts,
which it is forbidden to attach by law. Collateral securing other
loans with us may also secure this loan.
21. Illegal use of Card. Any financial service provided by the
Credit Union may only be used for any transaction permitted by
law. You agree that illegal use of any financial service will be
deemed an action of default and/or breach of contract and such
service and/or other related services may be terminated at the
discretion of the Credit Union. You further agree, should illegal
use occur, to waive the right to sue the Credit Union for such
illegal activity directly or indirectly related to it. You also agree to
indemnify and hold the Credit Union harmless from any suits or
other legal action or liability, directly or indirectly, resulting from
such illegal use. Such illegal use includes but is not limited to
gambling and any withdrawal of funds with the intent to conduct
illegal activity.

assign its account to any other person.

pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest
and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you
owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you
as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you
owe.
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is
wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still
refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent
without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must
tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as
delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the
matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to
pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is
correct.
YOUR RIGHTS IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED
WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services you have
purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith
to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right
not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or
within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the
purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note:
Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based
on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the
company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase.
Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with
a check that accesses your credit card account do not
qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied
with the purchase, contact us in writing (or electronically) at:

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed
amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we
will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an
amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.
The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating
against any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of race, color, religion, national
origin, sex, marital status or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract); or
because all or part of the applicants� income derives from any public assistance program;
or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit
Protection Act.

bill is wrong or if you need more information about a transaction on your 
bill, write us as soon as possible on a separate sheet at the address listed 
on your bill. We must hear from you no later than sixty (60) days after we 
sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can call 
us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. In your letter, give us the 
following information: 

� 
Your name, account number, current address and day-time 
telephone number 
� 
The dollar amount of the suspected error 
� 
Description of the error and an explanation, if you can, why you 
believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the 
information you are not sure about. 
� 
If you are disputing a transaction, further information about the 
dispute will be requested in writing by Purdue Federal in accordance 
with Visa U.S.A. operating rules. Contact Purdue Federal for more 
details. 
If you have authorized us to pay your credit card bill automatically from 
your savings or share draft account, you can stop the payment on any 
amount you think is wrong. To stop the payment, your letter must reach 
us three (3) business days before the automatic payment is scheduled to 
occur. 

Your Rights and Responsibilities After We Receive Your Written 
Notice. We must acknowledge your letter with a written notice within

Billing Cycles, but no later than ninety (90) days, we must either correct 
the error or explain why we believe the bill was correct. 

After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you 
question or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for 
the amount you question, including Interest Charges and we can apply 
any unpaid amount against your credit limit. You do not have to pay any 
questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated 
to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. 

If we find we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any 
Interest Charges related to any questioned amount. If we didn�t make a 
mistake, you may have to pay Interest Charges and you will have to make 
up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will 
send you a statement of the amount you owe, the date it is due and copies 
of documents or evidence, if requested by you. 

If you fail to pay the amount you owe, we may report you as delinquent; 
however, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write us within 
ten (10) days telling us you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we 
report you to that you have a question about your bill. We must tell you the 
name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to 
that the matter has been settled between us when resolved. 

Special Rule for Credit Card Purchases. If you have a problem with the 
quality of property or services you purchased with a credit card and you 
have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may 
have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or

your home state within one hundred (100) miles of your correct mailing 
address. 
(b) The purchase price must have been more than $50.

Visa� Credit Card 
Disclosure and 
Agreement 

PLEASE RETAIN THIS INFORMATION WITH OTHER FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS. 

This Agreement covers each Visa Account �Account� you have with us. It 
also covers the use of your Purdue Federal Credit Card Convenience Checks 
�Convenience Checks� in connection with your Account. The words �you� 
and �your� mean each and all of those who sign an Account application 
and any person authorized to access your account. �Card� means a Visa 
credit card and any duplicates and renewals Purdue Federal Credit Union 
�Purdue Federal� issues. �Account� means your Visa credit card line of credit 
account with Purdue Federal. By requesting, signing, using or keeping your 
card and/or Convenience Checks, you are agreeing to all the terms and 
conditions of this document including the right to cross-collateralization 
and the granting of a security interest. 

1. Using the Account. When you are approved for a Visa Account, Purdue 
Federal establishes a line of credit for you and notifies you of its amount 
when the Card is sent to you. In order for it to be valid, you must sign your 
Card as soon as you receive it. By requesting, signing, using or keeping 
your Card and/or Convenience Checks, you accept this Agreement. You 
also accept this Agreement by using your Card or Convenience Checks. You 
agree not to let your Account balance exceed your approved credit limit. 
Each payment you make on the Account will restore your credit limit by 
the amount of the payment, which is applied to the principal amount of 
purchases and cash advances. You may request an increase in your credit 
limit only by submitting an application, which may be approved by Purdue 
Federal. Purdue Federal has the right to reduce or terminate your credit 
limit at any time. 
2. Using the Card. You may use the Card issued to you to make purchases 
in person or by mail, telephone or Internet from merchants and others who 
accept Visa cards. In addition you may obtain cash advances from Purdue 
Federal, other financial institutions participating in the Visa program and 
select Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), such as Visa ATM Network, that 
provide access to the Visa system (not all ATMs provide such access). You 
will need to use your Personal Identification Number (PIN) to obtain a cash 
advance from an ATM. A Visa card may not be used for any illegal transaction. 
3. Using Convenience Checks. We may supply you with Convenience 
Checks from time to time. You may use these checks to draw on your 
available line of credit on your Account. A Convenience Check drawn on 
your Account is a loan from Purdue Federal to you. You will owe us for the 
amount of the Convenience Check plus the applicable Interest Charge from 
the date of the transaction. 

4. Overdraft Protection. If you have requested your Account to be used 
to provide Overdraft Protection for a Checking Account maintained with 
Purdue Federal, funds may be transferred from your Visa Account to the 
Checking Account in accordance with the Guide to Member Services governing 
the Checking Account. All funds will be transferred in increments 
of $100 and are processed as a cash advance under this Agreement and 
treated as such. Such transfers are loans by us to you. You will owe Purdue 
Federal for the amount of such transfers plus the applicable Interest 
Charge. You understand that anyone who is authorized to make withdrawals 
from the Checking Account may access your Visa Account through 
Overdraft Protection. 
5. Responsibility. You agree to pay all charges (purchases, transfers and 
cash advances) to your Account made by you or anyone who you authorized 
to use your Account. Your obligation to pay the amount owed on your 
Account continues until paid in full, even though an Agreement, divorce 
decree or other court judgment to which Purdue Federal is not a party may 
direct someone else to pay the Account balance. If more than one person 
signs this Agreement, each is individually responsible for all amounts 
owed on the Account and all are jointly responsible for all amounts owed. 
This means Purdue Federal can enforce this Agreement against any of you 
individually or all of you together. 
6. Making Payments. You promise to pay all amounts you owe on your 
Account, including any Interest or Late Charge. When you receive your 
billing statement you may pay the full amount due or a lesser amount, but 
the least you may pay is the minimum payment amount shown on your 
billing statement. Your minimum payment will be any amount past due 
or over-the-limit plus the larger of 3% of your new balance or $20. If we 
elect not to require a minimum monthly payment at any time, the Interest 
Charge on your Account will continue to accrue at the Annual Percentage 
Rate. Whatever you choose to pay, your payment must reach us no later 
than the payment due date shown on your statement. 
7. Interest Charges. The Annual Percentage Rate is an interest rate set by 
Purdue Federal. Separate Interest Charges for purchases and cash advances 
are determined by multiplying the periodic rate by the separate average 
daily balance for purchases and cash advances. Each average daily balance 
is determined by taking the beginning balance (of cash advances or purchases) 
in your Account each day, adding any new purchases or cash advances 
(whichever is applicable) and subtracting any payments or credits. 
The results are the daily balances. All daily balances for the statement cycle 
are added and the total is divided by the number of days in the statement 
cycle to arrive at the average daily balance for the cycle. Cash advances are 
always subject to a Interest Charge from the date they are posted to your 
Account. If a grace period applies: 
(a) Purchases. An Interest Charge will be imposed on purchase posted 
during a Billing Cycle when the Previous Balance is not paid in full within 
the first 25 days of the Billing Cycle. An Interest Charge will also be imposed 
on Purchases included in the new balance when the new balance is 
not paid in full within 25 days after the statement date. 

(b) Cash Advances. An Interest Charge will be imposed on Cash Advances 
from the date of the transaction to the date paid. The Interest Charge 
accrued on Cash Advances will appear on your next statement. There is no 
time period which to pay to avoid the Interest Charge on Cash Advances. 
(c) Balance Transfers. Balance Transfers will be processed as Cash Advances 
and an Interest Charge will be imposed from the date of the transaction 
to the date paid. The Interest Charge accrued on Balance Transfers will 
appear on your next statement. There is no time period which to pay to 
avoid the Interest Charge on Cash Advances. We are not responsible for 
late payment or nonpayment to other card issuers. 
8. Monthly Payment. Each month you must pay at least the minimum 
payment shown on your statement by the date specified on your monthly 
statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum 
payment, or pay the Total New Balance in full. If you make extra payments 
or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum 
payment each month your Account has a balance. Your minimum payment 
required each month is disclosed on the Agreement under �Making 
Payments�. In addition anytime your Total New Balance exceeds your credit 
limit, you must immediately pay the amount over your credit limit. 
9. Payment Allocation. Subject to applicable law, your minimum payment 
will be applied to what you owe Purdue Federal in the following 
order: interest, fees, promotional rate balances, cash advance balances and 
purchase balances. Excess payments over the minimum payment will be 
applied to the balance with highest interest rate and any remaining payment 
to next highest APR in descending order. 
10. Security Interest. You agree this loan is also secured by all the shares 
and deposits in all your individual and joint accounts with Purdue Federal 
now and in the future. Shares and deposits in an Individual Retirement 
Account and any other account that would lose special tax treatment under 
state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest 
you give in your shares and deposits. Property you have given to secure 
other loans will also secure this loan. 
11. Default. You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment 
or other required payment by the date it is due. You will be in default 
if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in 
default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable 
to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if 
you make any false or misleading statements in any credit applications 
or credit update. You will be in default if something happens that Purdue 
Federal believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you 
owe. When you are in default, Purdue Federal has the right to demand immediate 
payment of your full Account balance without notice. If immediate 
payment is demanded, you will continue to pay an Interest Charge at 
the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid 
and any collateral given as security will be applied toward what you owe 
or sold pursuant to law. To the extent permitted by law, you will also be 
required to pay Purdue Federal�s collection expenses, including court costs 
and reasonable attorney�s fees. 

12. Liability for Unauthorized Use. Your Purdue Federal Visa offers 
�zero liability� for unauthorized use. To obtain the �zero liability� status you 
must report any unauthorized use of your Account immediately. 
13. Lost Card Notification. If you believe your credit card has been lost 
or stolen, inform Purdue Federal immediately. Notify Purdue Federal in 
writing or by calling 800.627.3328. 
14. Changing or Terminating Your Account. Purdue Federal may 
change the terms of this Agreement from time to time after giving you 
advance notice as required by law. Your use of the Card after receiving 
notice of a change will indicate your agreement to the change. To the 
extent the law permits, and indicated in the notice to you, the change will 
apply to your existing Account balance as well as to future transactions. 
Either you or Purdue Federal may terminate this Agreement at any time, 
but termination by you or Purdue Federal will not affect your obligation to 
pay the Account balance plus any Interest Charges and other charges you 
owe under this Agreement. The cards you receive remain the property of 
Purdue Federal and you must recover and surrender to Purdue Federal all 
cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you 
or Purdue Federal. 
If you choose not to accept any of these terms, your credit limit will be removed 
and your minimum payment will be calculated based on a five-year 
amortization schedule. To opt out, Purdue Federal requires written notice 
by electronic mail to mbrservice@purduefed.com or by postal mail to PO 
Box 1950, West Lafayette, IN 47996-1950. 

15. Credit Information. You authorize Purdue Federal to investigate your 
credit standing when opening or reviewing your Account. You authorize 
Purdue Federal to disclose information regarding your Account to credit 
bureaus and creditors who inquire about your standing. 
16. Returns and Adjustments. Merchants and others who honor the 
Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by 
sending Purdue Federal an electronic credit, which will be posted to your 
Account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe Purdue Federal, 
the amount will be credited to your share account. Any outstanding 
credits will be credited to your share account within 30 days. 
17. Foreign Transactions. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign 
countries and foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. The 
conversion rate to U.S. dollars will be made in accordance with the operating 
regulations for international transactions established by Visa U.S.A. The 
conversion rate to U.S. dollars will be a rate selected by Visa from the range 
of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central 
processing date, which may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or the 
government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing 
date, in each instance, plus or minus any adjustment determined by the 
Issuer. You will be charged an International Service Assessment (ISA) fee 
mandated by Visa, up to 1% of the transaction amount based on whether 
the transaction is processed in U.S. dollars or converted to U.S. dollars. All 
transactions, including online transactions, that may have been originated 
by the cardholder in the U.S., but are processed by a foreign merchant are 
subject to this fee. You may not receive prior notification from the merchant 
that your transaction is processed overseas. This is not a fee assigned 
by Purdue Federal. 

18. Merchant Disputes. Purdue Federal is not responsible for the refusal 
of any merchant or financial institution to honor the Card. Purdue Federal 
is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of 
goods and services you purchase with the Card. 
19. Effect of Agreement. This Agreement is the contract that applies 
to all transactions on your Account even though the sales, cash advances, 
credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms. You 
agree to all the terms and charges contained in this Agreement. 
20. No Waiver. Purdue Federal can delay enforcing any of its rights any 
number of times without losing these rights. 
21. Statements and Notices. You will receive a statement each month 
showing transactions on your Account. Statements and notices will be 
provided to you at your physical or electronic address, whichever method 
you prefer. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered a notice to all. 
Statements may not be generated when there are no transactions on the 
Account. It is your responsibility to notify Purdue Federal upon a change of 
address�electronic mail or postal mail. 
22. Other Fees and Charges. Other Charges and Fees that apply will be 
added to your Account on the Monthly Statement for the billing cycle in 
which they are incurred, as follows: 
a) Late Payment � A late fee of $25 or the minimum payment due 
rounded to the whole dollar, whichever is less, will be charged if we do 
not receive your minimum payment on or before the payment due date as 
noted on your Monthly Statement. 

b) Returned Check Fee � A fee up to $25 will be charged if you (i) make a 
payment on your account with a check, draft, negotiable order of withdrawal 
or similar instrument drawn on a depository institution and such 
instrument is not paid or is dishonored by that financial institution, or 

(ii) issue a Convenience Check for which there are not sufficient available 
funds on your Account.

1.3.3: Delay in Enforcement. The Bank may exercise its rights under the Card Agreement immediately or, at the Bank's sole discretion, may decline to enforce or delay in enforcing any such rights without losing, waiving, or impairing them.

The Bank may sell, assign, or transfer the Card Agreement or your Card Account or any portion thereof without notice to you. Subject to the foregoing, the Card Agreement shall be binding upon the heirs, representatives, successors, and assigns of the parties hereto.

1.4: AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT: The Bank may amend this Agreement by changing, adding or deleting any term, condition, service or feature (�New Term�) of your Account or of this Agreement at any time. The Bank will provide you with notice of the amendment to the extent required by law. Unless we state otherwise, any New Term may apply only to new activity on your account. If the amendment includes any change for which we need your consent, we will obtain your consent before that New Term becomes effective. If we need to do so, we may obtain your consent in any one or more of the following ways: (a) by your usage of the Account after we give you notice of the amendment; (b) by your failure to write us on time if we request that you write us to reject a New Term; or (c) by your affirmative agreement which may be obtained verbally, in writing or electronically.
1.4.1: If you do not agree to the Amendment. You must notify the Bank in the manner provided with the amendment within 25 days after the effective date of the change, and the Bank may close your Card Account and may elect to have you pay the Outstanding Balance as provided by law. Otherwise, you shall be deemed to have agreed to the change(s) in the Bank�s notice. Use of the Card after the effective date of the change shall be deemed to be your acceptance of the new terms.
1.4.2: Any other term in the amendment will become effective without your consent, although you may be able to avoid a fee or charge by not making the type of transaction to which it applies after the effective date of the amendment.

1.5: CREDIT LIMIT: The Credit Limit on your Card Account is disclosed on each monthly statement (your initial Credit Limit appears on the folder containing the Card). Bank may decline authorization for any use of your Card or Card Account that would at any time cause your Outstanding Balance to exceed your Credit Limit.  Any spending above your Credit Limit will require contemporaneous approval by Bank pursuant to Section 2.0, and Bank may in its sole discretion for any reason decline such approval. You are liable for the Outstanding Balance even if it exceeds your Credit Limit. The Bank may increase or decrease your Credit Limit at any time and will notify you of such change. In addition, you may request a change in your Credit Limit by writing to the address shown on your monthly statement or by calling 1-800-494-1698.

2.0: NO PRE-SET SPENDING LIMIT: There is no pre-set spending limit on your card; no pre-set spending limit does not mean unlimited spending. You agree to pay in full each month any amount that exceeds your Credit Limit. Each transaction that causes your new balance to exceed your Credit Limit will be evaluated for approval based on factors such as card fraud, account history, revolving balances, payment history, credit record, prior cash advances and safety and soundness considerations.

3.0: THE CARD:
3.1: Signature Panel. For your protection, the back of the Card contains a signature panel, which should be signed before the Card may be used.
3.2: Card is Bank's Property. The Card is the property of the Bank and must be returned to the Bank if the Bank so requests. Also, the Bank can at any time and without cause and without notice, revoke the right to use the Card. If a merchant or a financial institution where the Card is attempted to be used asks for the surrender of the Card, it must be surrendered immediately.
3.3: Expiration. The Card will not be valid after the expiration date printed on the front of the Card and it must not be used after that date.
3.4: Renewal and Replacement Cards. The Bank will continue to issue renewal or replacement Cards until the Bank revokes the right to use the Card or until your Card Account is closed.
3.5: Additional Cards. You may request additional Cards at no additional cost for members of your family or for others you authorize to use your Card Account. However, you are responsible for all charges to your Card Account made by such persons.

4.1: Purchases. The Card may be used to purchase or lease goods or services wherever the Card is honored.
4.2: Cash Advances. Subject to your available Credit Limit, the Card may be used to obtain cash advances or make a quasi cash transaction from your Card Account (1) in person at the Bank or any participating financial institution or (2) at any ATM in the Bank network or any of the other participating ATM networks, subject to the following limitation (certain ATMs may have other limits): the total dollar amount of such ATM cash advances plus all cash withdrawal electronic fund transfers made during any calendar day (from midnight to midnight) may not exceed $3,000 for each card issued with your Card Account number. Each cash advance or quasi cash transaction will create a charge to your Card Account.
4.2.1: Use of your Credit Card to withdraw cash from ATM�s located outside of the Unites States creates a cash advance from and charge to your Card Account even if you select withdrawal from checking or savings account or any other type of account.
4.3: Electronic Online Cash Advances: Subject to your available Credit Limit, the Card may be used to obtain electronic online cash advances from your Card Account. Based on risk, we reserve the right to limit electronic online cash advance access at the sole discretion of the Bank. Each electronic online cash advance will be treated as a cash advance subject to a Cash Advance Transaction Fee charged to your Card Account.
4.4: Balance Transfers. Subject to your available Credit Limit, you can request a balance transfer to your Card Account. You may not use a balance transfer to pay off any other accounts you have with the Bank. You may only make a balance transfer to accounts that list you as an account holder. Allow 4 to 6 weeks to process your balance transfer request, during which time you should continue to make payments to those accounts. You will not earn any rewards points or cash back on a balance transfer.
4.5: Credit Card Checks. For promotional purposes the Bank may provide a supply of Credit Card Checks to access your account. Use of the Credit Card Checks creates a cash advance from and charge to your Card Account. Each unused Check is the property of the Bank and must be returned to the Bank if the Bank so requests. Also, the Bank can, at any time and without cause and without notice, revoke the right to use the Credit Card Checks. You agree to waive any right you may have to stop payment on a Credit Card Check.
4.6: Internet Transactions: Your card is a Visa branded card. Enrollment in the Verified by Visa program is required after 3 Internet purchases. In order for you to make transactions over the Internet, merchants may request your Verified by Visa password to complete the transaction. If a password is not provided, the merchant may deny the transaction. If the password is incorrect we may deny the transaction. By allowing another to use your Verified by Visa password, you are authorizing the transaction on your account.
4.7: Internet Gambling Notice: Restricted transactions as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation GG are prohibited from being processed through this account or relationship. Restricted transactions generally include, but are not limited to, those in which credit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or drafts are knowingly accepted by gambling businesses in connection with the participation by others in unlawful Internet gambling. We have elected to not offer accounts to organizations that offer or sponsor Internet gambling. Commercial accounts receiving or processing Internet gambling transactions are subject to closure.
4.8: Transfers. Not available on all Visa Signature cards. For cards with transfer capability the Card may be used at the ATMs described above to make electronic transfers to or from your checking account, savings account or other consumer asset account you may have at the Bank (subject to the Bank's rules, regulations and agreements governing such accounts, which you should have already received and which are incorporated herein). You may request copies of these materials by calling 1-866-749-7459. Transfers from your Card Account to your checking account, savings account or other consumer asset account will be treated as a cash advance subject to a Cash Advance Transaction Fee.

5.0: MONTHLY STATEMENTS: The Bank will send you (or one of you) a monthly statement summarizing each transaction on your Card Account during the preceding billing period. Your monthly statement will show your current credit limit, the total amount you owe as of the end of the billing period, including any interest charges, fees, the minimum payment due and the payment due date, which date is at least 25 days from the monthly statement closing date. If applicable, your monthly statement will also show any amount you owe that exceeds your credit limit, which you agree to pay in full by the payment due date in addition to any minimum payment due. The Bank will mail or deliver your monthly statement to only one address. Preservation of your rights under federal law regarding resolution of billing errors depends upon your timely recognition of potential errors, as explained in �Billing Rights Summary� notice at the end of this Agreement.

6.0: HOW THE NEW BALANCE IS DETERMINED: The total amount that you owe the Bank at the end of the current billing period appears as the �New Balance� on the monthly statement. The Outstanding Balance at the end of the previous billing period is called the �Previous Balance�. The New Balance is determined by taking the Previous Balance and (1) subtracting any payments and credits received by the Bank during the current billing period and then (2) adding any purchases, cash advances, quasi cash transactions, interest charges, fees, and, other adjustments.

7.0: PAYMENTS: You promise to pay the Bank according to the terms of this Agreement the entire amount owing hereunder. You agree to make all payments in U.S. Dollars drawn on funds on deposit in the United States (however, the Bank may at its option choose to accept payments made in foreign currency or made by drawing on funds on deposit outside the United States, in which case you agree to pay all conversion fees and bank collection fees incurred by the Bank, which amounts will be treated as purchase items). Do not send cash payments.
7.1: Payment Due Date. The payment due date on your Account will be the same date each month and your payment will be due by 5:00 p.m. in the manner and location specified on your billing statement.
7.2: Amount of Minimum Payment. If the New Balance is less than $30, the minimum payment is the full amount of the New Balance. If the New Balance is $30 or more, the minimum payment is the total of two figures: the first is any past due amount; the second is the sum of the greater of $30 plus late fees, or the combined total of 2.5% of the New Balance plus interest charges and late fees. You shall make (and the Bank shall have received at the address designated on your monthly statement) on or before 5:00 p.m. on the due date the minimum payment shown on your monthly statement (or, at your option, any greater amount up to the Outstanding Balance). Receipt of your minimum payment at any address other than that designated on your monthly statement may create a delay in posting the minimum payment to your Card Account and may thereby result in a late fee and additional interest charges. Making only the minimum payment will increase the amount of interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance.
7.3: Application of Payments. The amount of payments credited to your Account during a billing period will be applied first to unpaid interest charges, then to any miscellaneous fees, then to the balance having the highest APR, and then to each successive balance bearing the next higher APR until the payment is exhausted.�Balances having the same APR will be paid beginning with the oldest balance first. Payment for more than the minimum payment amount (but not more than the Outstanding Balance) will be accepted as a single payment for that billing period; the amount in excess of the minimum payment will not be applied toward future payments due.
7.4: Acceptance of Partial or Nonconforming Payments. The Bank may accept late payments, partial payments or any payment marked with any kind of restrictive endorsement (such as �paid in full� or �in settlement�) without giving effect to the restrictive endorsement and without losing, waiving, or impairing any of the Bank's rights under this Agreement or under applicable law.
7.5: Delay of Available Credit: We credit payments to your account on the day we receive them however, we reserve the right, based on risk, to delay the available credit resulting from those payments.
7.6: Prepayment. You may repay all or any portion of the Outstanding Balance at any time without penalty.

8.0: DEFAULT: If the minimum payment is not received at the proper address on or before the payment due date, or if you fail to honor any other obligation under this Agreement, or if you die, file for bankruptcy, or become insolvent or generally unable to pay your debts, or if you have furnished false or misleading information on the Card Application, or if you are in default under any other obligations you may owe to the Bank, or if the Bank reasonably believes that you are unable or unwilling to honor all of your obligations under this Agreement, the Bank may declare the Outstanding Balance immediately due and payable, may close your Card Account, and recover the Card and all unused Credit Card Checks.

9.0: LEGAL ACTION AND COSTS: Without waiving the Dispute Resolution provisions of this Agreement, the Bank may take legal action (including collection action) against you and you agree to pay all collection costs whether or not awardable as court costs (including the cost of Bank staff) and reasonable attorney fees (including those of salaried Bank employees). If the Bank sues to collect and you win the lawsuit, the Bank will pay your court costs and reasonable attorney fees. Also, you agree that regardless of where you reside, the Bank may initiate legal action against you in the State of Texas and you hereby submit yourself to jurisdiction of the courts therein.

10.0: INTEREST CHARGES: The following interest charges will apply whether before or after default, judgment, or the closing of your Card Account.
10.1: Periodic Interest Charges on Purchases, Cash Advances, Quasi Cash Transactions and Balance Transfers. No periodic interest charge on purchases will be assessed if you have paid the total New Balance listed on the previous monthly statement in full by the payment due date (which is at least 25 days from the monthly statement closing date); otherwise, a periodic interest charge will be assessed on each purchase from the date of the purchase transaction. If during the previous billing cycle you paid in full by the payment due date, then in the current billing cycle you will have a grace period on the amount of any purchase balance in the current billing cycle that is paid by the payment due date, based on our payment allocation method. A periodic interest charge will be assessed on each cash advance, quasi cash transaction or balance transfer from the date of such transaction; there is no grace period within which such a transaction can be repaid without incurring an interest charge.
10.2: Periodic Interest Charge Calculation(s). The total amount of interest charge for a billing period will be calculated as follows (interest charges on purchases and interest charges on cash advances, quasi cash transactions and balance transfers are calculated separately and then the resulting amounts combined to arrive at the total interest charges for the billing period): (1) We first determine the �average daily balance� of your account (including new transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases (or cash advances, quasi cash transactions or balance transfers) and then subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance (any unpaid interest charges incurred during that billing period are not included in the daily balance). Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the average daily balance, which is also called the �balance subject to interest charge� on your monthly statement; (2) We multiply the balance subject to interest charge by the number of days in the billing period; the resulting number is then multiplied by the daily periodic rate to determine the amount of interest charge.

11.0: ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR):
11.1: Daily Periodic Rate (DPR) and APR for Purchases. The DPR will be 1/365 (1/366 for a leap year) of the then current APR. The APR which is calculated on the average daily balance is a variable rate (subject to limits set by statute). The APR in effect throughout a particular billing period will be 3.50% plus the Bank's PRIME RATE (as defined below) in effect on the day that precedes by 6 business days the first calendar day of the calendar month in which that billing period ends. The APR and DPR in effect for each billing period are disclosed on the corresponding monthly statement.
11.2: APR for Cash Advances, Quasi Cash Transactions and Balance Transfers: The APR in effect throughout a particular billing period for cash advances, quasi cash transactions and balance transfers will be 10.00% plus the Prime Rate.
11.3: Effect of Change in Rate. All other factors being equal, and subject to the method by which the minimum payment is calculated (as described above), an increase in the APR will increase the minimum payment, and a decrease in the APR will decrease the minimum payment.
11.4: Prime Rate: The interest rate on your account is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an independent index which is the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal (the �Index�). If a range of rates has been published, the higher of the rates will be used. Information about the Index is available or published daily in the Wall Street Journal. You acknowledge that the Prime Rate as used herein does not mean the lowest rate at which the Bank has made or may make loans to any of its customers, either now or in the future. If the Index becomes unavailable, the Bank may designate a substitute Index after providing notice to you. The APR will increase when the Prime Rate increases. If the Prime Rate changes, resulting in a change in the APR, the change will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle the following month.

The applied Index for the following as of 08/22/2010 is 3.25%.

11.5: DPR for Purchases: The DPR for transactions posting as Purchases is equal to its corresponding APR. To determine your rate for Purchases, we add the Index to a margin of 3.50% resulting in a DPR of 0.018493 (corresponding APR of 6.75%)
11.6: DPR for Cash Advances, Quasi Cash Transactions and Balance Transfers: The DPR for transactions posting as a cash advance, quasi cash transaction or balance transfer is equal to its corresponding APR. To determine the rate, we add the Index to a margin of 10.00% resulting in a DPR of 0.036301 (corresponding APR of 13.25%).

12.0: CASH ADVANCE AND QUASI CASH TRANSACTION FEE: Each new cash advance or quasi cash transaction will be assessed a one-time transaction fee not to exceed the greater of $2 or 2% of the transaction. The transaction fee shall be fully earned when assessed.

13.0: OTHER FEES AND CHARGES:
13.1: Balance Transfer Fee: Each new Balance Transfer will be assessed a fee equal to 2% of the Balance Transfer, but not less than $5.00 or more than $50.00.
13.2: Late Payment Fee. If the minimum payment shown on your monthly statement is not received at the proper address on or before the payment due date, there will be a late fee not to exceed the lesser of $15 or 5% of the payment due after unpaid for 10 days (including weekends).
13.3: Returned Payment Fee. If any check or other payment on your Card Account is dishonored or must be returned because it cannot be processed, there will be a Returned Payment Fee equal to the amount of the minimum payment due but no more than $25, which will be treated as a purchase item.
13.4: Annual Membership Fee. $75, first year fee is waived.
13.5: International Transaction Fee. 2% of the U.S. dollar amount of the transaction, whether originally made in U.S. dollars or converted from a foreign currency. If you incur a charge in a foreign currency, the charge will be converted into a U.S. Dollar amount by Visa International. Currently, the currency conversion rate used is either a wholesale market rate or a government mandated rate in effect one day prior to the date the transaction is processed by Visa International plus two percent (2%) of the U.S. dollar rate. The currency conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date or the posting date.
13.5: Research Fee ($25). For research that you request on your Card Account (unless such involves an allegation of a billing error made by the Bank), there will be a research charge of $25 per hour, plus $5 per photocopy.
13.6: Expedited Card Delivery or Emergency Card Fee: If you request the Bank to provide �expedited card delivery� (which requires the services of an outside delivery service provider) or you request to personally obtain an �emergency card� (which requires special card production) at our Bankcard Center, you agree that we may charge a fee up to $75 for this service.

14.0: JOINT ACCOUNT. If your Card Account is in the name of more than one person, each and every such person shall be jointly and severally liable for the full Outstanding Balance, including without limitation any amount in excess of your Credit Limit. In addition, except as otherwise required by applicable law, you agree that all monthly statements and notices regarding your Card Account may be sent to any one of you.

15.0: INTERPRETATION; EFFECT:
15.1: Duration. Except for your right to use the Card and to make charges to your Card Account (which right expires when your Card Account is closed); all other provisions of the Card Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until your Card Account is closed and your Outstanding Balance is paid in full.
15.2: Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall have no bearing on the interpretation of this Agreement.
15.3: Governing Law. THE CARD AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF THE STATE OF TEXAS REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU MAY RESIDE OR USE YOUR CARD.

16.0: DISCLOSURES OF INFORMATION: You acknowledge and consent to the release of personal data about Cardholders by the Bank to Visa U.S.A., its Members, or their respective contractors for the purpose of providing emergency cash and emergency card replacement services.

17.0: RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF CARD ACCOUNT: Only the individual named on the Card is permitted to use it for charges, identification, or any other reason.
17.1: No Illegal Purpose. The Card, Card Account or Credit Card Checks shall not be used for any illegal purpose. You also agree not to use your Card or Credit Card Checks to gamble on the Internet or for any transaction that violates applicable law. We may block or refuse to approve any transaction that we believe may violate this provision.

18.0: LIABILITY FOR OBLIGATIONS:
18.1: Your Liability. You shall be liable for the full amounts of your Outstanding Balance regardless of the purpose whether for business purposes or for personal, family or household purposes of any of the charges made with the Cards or Credit Card Checks. Your liability shall also include all charges regardless of the purpose made by any person to whom you have given expressed or implied permission to use the Card, Card Account or Credit Card Checks or has voluntarily provided the Card or Card number. 
18.2: User's Liability. In addition to and not in lieu of your liability as set forth above, each User shall be jointly, and severally liable with you for all amounts resulting from: (a) all charges made by User for personal, family, or household purposes; and (b) all charges made by any person to whom that User has given express or implied permission to use the Card or Card Account or Credit Card Checks or has voluntarily provided the Card or the Card number, regardless of the purpose of any such charge.

19.0: LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE: If your Card, Card Account number or Credit Card Checks are lost or stolen, or if you think that someone used or may use them without permission, you agree to notify the Bank immediately by calling 1-866-749-7459. You may need to provide the Bank with certain information in writing to help the Bank determine what happened.

Visa� Platinum Rewards Line of Credit Agreement between Affinity Plus and You. 
The purpose of this Agreement is to establish the terms and conditions of a Visa� Platinum Rewards CREDIT CARD line of credit between Affinity Plus and you. In this agreement, the word �you� means each person who applies for 
a Visa� Credit Card or who is authorized to use the credit card. �We�, �us� or �our� refers to Affinity Plus Federal Credit Union. The Word �card� means your Visa� Credit Card and any duplicates of that card. The word �account� 
means your Visa� Credit Card revolving credit account with Affinity Plus. Please read this agreement carefully because it tells you your rights and obligations for these transactions. You should keep this notice for future reference. 
You can use your Visa� line of credit to: 
� Make purchases from any vendor who accepts Visa�, including telephone and internet transactions. 
� Take a cash advance against your line of credit at an ATM, financial institution, or other vendors (many hotels will give you an advance). 
� Write convenience checks against your line which is treated as a cash advance (the interest begins accruing immediately). However, the cash advance fee noted below does not apply on convenience checks or balance transfers. 
1. LINE OF CREDIT. Approval by Affinity Plus will establish the following: 
� The credit limit approved. This credit limit will be drawn upon as you utilize the issued Visa� Credit Card. 
� The line of credit will be repaid in accordance with terms and conditions set forth herein. 
� This card remains the property of Affinity Plus and will be surrendered immediately upon request. This card is not transferable and the privileges may be revoked anytime without prior written notice. 
2. USING YOUR CARD. You understand that use of your credit card will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms and of the Line of Credit Agreement and Disclosure. 
3. FINANCE CHARGE � CASH ADVANCE. The FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances is calculated as follows: A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on cash advances that you obtain through the use of your card during the current 
billing cycle from the date of each Cash Advance. The finance charge will continue to accrue until paid if paid during the same billing cycle as made, or if not paid in full during the same billing cycle as made, the FINANCE CHARGE 
will continue to accrue on the unpaid balance until closing date of the billing cycle preceding the date on which the entire new balance is paid in full. The method of computing the balance of cash advances subject to FINANCE 
CHARGE is the average daily outstanding unpaid balance, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of cash advances is 
determined by adding to the previous balance any new cash advances as of the transaction date, and subtracting each payment and credit on the date of receipt, but excluding any unpaid FINANCE CHARGES. 
4. FINANCE CHARGES � CREDIT PURCHASES. The FINANCE CHARGE on credit purchases is calculated as follows: A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on credit purchases of goods and services that you obtain through the use of 
your card only if you elect not to pay the entire new balance shown on your previous monthly statement within 25 days from the closing date of the statement. If you elect not to pay the entire new balance shown on your previous 
monthly statement within 25 days from the closing date of the statement, a FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on the unpaid balance of credit purchases from the statement closing date and on credit purchases made during the 
current billing cycle from the transaction date of each such credit purchases to the account. FINANCE CHARGES will continue to accrue until the closing date of the billing cycle proceeding the date on which the entire new balance is 
paid in full. The method of computing the balance of credit purchases subject to FINANCE CHARGES is the average daily outstanding unpaid balance, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing 
cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of credit purchases is determined by adding to the previous balance any new credit purchases if the previous balance was not paid in full within 25 days of the statement 
closing date, and subtracting each payment and credit on the date of receipt, but excluding any unpaid FINANCE CHARGES. 
5. PERIODIC RATE. The periodic rate used to compute the FINANCE CHARGE for purchases is .825% per month. The corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is 9.90% and will be based on your cumulative credit history. The periodic 
rate used to compute the FINANCE CHARGE on balance transfers is .492% per month. The corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is 5.9%. The APR will never be greater than 18%. Your APR is determined by your credit score at 
the time of a new application and will be reviewed every six (6) months. To determine your cumulative credit history, we use information from a consumer report provided by TransUnion, 2 Bladwin Place, P.O. Box 1000, Chester, PA 
19022, (800) 888-4213 or www.AnnualCreditReport.com. You have the right to obtain a copy of your Consumer Report from the consumer agency without a charge. You may do so by calling the toll-free number or accessing the 
Web site. 
6. FEES. In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account: 
a. Late Payment Fee � A late fee of $15.00 will be accessed to your account if the minimum payment is not paid by the stated due date. 
b. Cash Advance Fee � A cash advance fee of 2% of the transaction amount with a minimum of $2.00 and a maximum of $99.00 will be added to your account. 
c. Returned Check or Item fee � If a check, share draft or automated payment used to pay your account is returned unpaid, you will be charged a $20.00 fee. 
7. REPAYMENT. Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new 
balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 3% of your total 
new balance, or $15.00, whichever is greater, or the entire balance if less than $15 plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made and any amounts you are over your credit limit. We have the right to 
demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. 
8. EXPIRATION. Your card will expire three years from date of issue. If you still meet the required criteria, a new card will be issued automatically. 
9. CONVENIENCE CHECKS. Convenience checks to access your line of credit are only issued at the time of account opening. 
10. 24-HOUR CARDHOLDER SERVICE NUMBER: (800) 654-7728. Use this number to report your card lost or stolen. 
11. COLLECTION COSTS. In event of an action to collect unpaid balances, all costs, including attorney�s fees, as may be reasonable and just, and also those costs, expenses and attorney�s fees incurred in bankruptcy and appellate 
proceedings, shall be imposed. 
12. SECURITY INTEREST. If you give us a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate Pledge of Shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure 
your account until we agree to release all or part of the pledged amount. YOUR ACCOUNT IS SECURED BY ALL OTHER SHARES YOU HAVE IN ANY INDIVIDUAL OR JOINT ACCOUNT WITH US, EXCEPT FOR SHARES 
IN AN IRA OR ANY OTHER ACCOUNT THAT WOULD LOSE SPECIAL TAX TREATMENT UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL LAW IF GIVEN AS SECURITY. THESE OTHER SHARES MAY BE WITHDRAWN UNLESS YOU 
ARE IN DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. YOU AUTHORIZE US TO APPLY THE AGREEMENT. YOU AUTHORIZE US TO APPLY THE BALANCE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL OR JOINT SHARE ACCOUNT TO PAY ANY

not withstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement. 
13. RESPONSIBILITY. You promise to pay any and all charges incurred by yourself or by any person whom you authorize to use your Visa� Credit Card and any fees or charges incurred thereof. 
14. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT AND CHANGES. This agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advance, disclosures or credit slips you sign or receive may contain different 
terms. Subject to applicable law, we may change this agreement at any time, including the rate or method of determining the FINANCE CHARGE, by giving you written notice and as allowed by law. You have the right to opt-out 
of any change to your account. If you would like to opt-out of any change to your account after notification, please submit your request in writing or call 1-800-322-7228 by the stated due date in the received notification. If you

promotion or discount, and cannot be earned from or transferred to any other charge or credit accounts. 
3) Points are non-transferrable and are forfeited in the event the account is closed. If the account is reopened, the forfeited points will not be reinstated. 
4) Only accounts that comply with the terms and conditions of this credit card agreement will be eligible to earn points. If your account is delinquent or over limit, you will not accrue points, and we will have the option to with

to correct such errors at any time, even if it affects an existing order. 
7) Affinity Plus Federal Credit Union may, from time to time, find it necessary to change the program rules, regulations, benefits, conditions of participation or point levels, in whole or in part, with or without notice. Changes may 
affect the points already accumulated. We reserve the right to terminate the program for any or all of our credit card programs at any time.

conditions of this agreement shall remain in effect. Married Wisconsin Residents Only. No provision of any marital property agreement, unilateral statement, or court order applying of material property will adversely affect a creditor�s

In your letter, give us the following information: 
� Account information: Your name and account number. 
� Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
� Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.

� At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. 
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter. 
When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 
1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 
2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. 
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 
� We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
� The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. 
� While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. 
� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 
� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. 
� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report 
you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.

YOUR RIGHTS IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES 
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchants, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the 
purchase. 
To use this right, all of the following must be true: 
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on 
an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

Affinity Plus Federal Credit Union

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called �daily balance�. 

During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the daily rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 

To calculate the daily interest charge, we do the following steps each day for each balance type: 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 

We apply fees among various balance types as follows: 

(a) late payment fees are treated as new purchases; 
(b) debt cancellation fees are added proportionately to each balance; 
(c) cash advance and stop payment fees are added to the cash advance balance; 
(d) balance transfer fees are added to the balance transfer balance; and 
(e) foreign transaction fees are added to the purchase balance. 

� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 

� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 

Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. 

Variable Rate Information 

The prime rate for a billing cycle is the highest bank prime loan rate published in The Wall Street Journal in its Money Rates section on the last business day of the calendar month preceding the first day of the billing cycle. 

If the prime rate increases, the daily rates (and corresponding APRs) may increase. As a result, interest, your total minimum payment and the number of payments it would take you to pay off your account balance may increase. We will apply any change in the daily rates because of a prime rate change to your entire account balance. A change in the prime rate will take effect on the first day of the billing cycle after the change. We may select a new interest rate index if the prime rate is not available.

2. PARTIES. The parties to this Agreement are you and GE Money Bank. GE Money Bank is located at 170 Election Drive, Suite 125, Draper, Utah 84020. 
GE Money Bank sometimes is called �us,� �we� or �our� in this Agreement. 

3. PROMISE TO PAY. You promise to pay us for all credit that we extend on your account, including credit extended when you let another person use your account. You also promise to pay us for all other amounts owed to us under this Agreement. 

4. CHANGING TERMS. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may change, add to or delete any of the terms of this Agreement, including the interest rates, fees and charges. 

5. GOVERNING LAW. Except as provided in the Dispute and Claim Resolution (Including Arbitration) provision, this Agreement and your account are governed by federal law and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of Utah without regard to its conflicts of law principles. This Agreement has been accepted by us in Utah. 

6. CREDIT CARD. We have issued or will send you a GE Money Platinum MasterCard for your use. You are not permitted to allow anyone else to use your credit card, but if you do, you will be responsible for such use. You will destroy all the credit card(s) issued on your account if we ask you to do so. 

7. AUTHORIZED USER/JOINT ACCOUNT. If you ask us to send a credit card to another person that you want to let use your account, you will be responsible for all transactions made by that person. That person will be considered an authorized user. If another person is approved on the account, that person will be considered a joint accountholder. Each joint accountholder may use the account and agrees to the terms of this Agreement. No matter which joint accountholder uses the account, each of you must pay back the full amount owed on the account. We may treat each of you as one accountholder. For example, giving notice to one of you is considered the same as giving notice to both of you. Also, we may follow the instructions that we get from one of you even if they differ from instructions given by the other accountholder. 

8. USING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may use your account only as stated in this Agreement. You may use your account for the following: 

� Purchases � You may buy goods or services from any merchant that accepts MasterCard credit cards; 

� Cash Advances � You may get cash advances as explained in section 9 below; and 

� Balance Transfers � From time to time, we may offer you the chance to transfer balances from your other credit card accounts to this account. Unless we tell you otherwise, we will treat balance transfers as purchases. We reserve the right to decline to process any balance transfer request for any reason, and will not transfer a balance from any of our affiliates. Transfers will be processed in the order determined by us. If the amount you wish to transfer is greater than your available credit limit, we may reject the request(s). It may take up to four weeks for a balance transfer request to be credited to your other credit card account(s). It is your responsibility to make any payments required to keep your other account(s) current and to close your other account(s), if you desire. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur on your other account(s) as a result of your balance transfer(s). If you have a dispute with a creditor, and pay the balance in question by transferring it to your account, you may lose certain dispute rights. 

You may use your account only for lawful personal, family or household purposes. You may not use your account for internet gambling or illegal purposes. You may not use your account to pay amounts you owe us on this account or on other accounts you have with us. These restrictions are for our benefit, and we are not responsible to you for enforcing them. 

9. Cash Advances. We may offer you the opportunity to get a cash advance in the following ways: 

� Convenience Checks. We may send you convenience checks. We may not honor a convenience check (i) if you filed for bankruptcy, (ii) if the check is expired, (iii) if your account is closed, (iv) if the amount of the check would exceed your available credit or cash advance limit, or (v) as otherwise stated on your convenience check. 

� Cash and ATM Withdrawals. You can get cash from any institution that accepts the card or account. You can also get cash by making a withdrawal from an automated teller machine (ATM) that accepts the card or account. In addition to the fee we may charge, the ATM owner may charge you a fee for using the ATM. 

� Cash-Like Transactions. If you use your card or account to buy certain cash-like items, we will treat those purchases as cash advances. Cash-like items include, for example, money orders, cashier�s checks, traveler�s checks, electronic or wire transfers, foreign currency or other in-bank transactions, tax payments, lottery tickets or other legalized gambling transactions, court costs, bail bonds and fines. 

10. CREDIT AND CASH ADVANCE LIMITS. 

A. Assigning Limits. We will assign the following limits on your account. We may increase or decrease either or both of these limits at any time. 

� Credit Limit � This is the highest amount of total credit we will extend to you on your account. 

� Cash Advance Limit � This is the highest amount of credit we will extend to you for cash advances made on your account. Cash transactions will also count towards your credit limit. 

B. Exceeding Limits. We may refuse to authorize you to use your account if that use (including any fees associated with that use) will cause the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit limit. You may not get a cash advance if that cash advance (including interest and cash advance fees) will cause the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit. If we approve a transaction that causes the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit limit or the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit, we do not give up any of our rights under this Agreement and we do not treat it as an increase in your credit limit. 

C. Limiting Purchases, Balance Transfers or Cash Advances. We reserve the right to not approve transactions on your account. To prevent fraud, we may also limit the number or dollar amount of purchases, balance transfers or cash advances you can make in a particular amount of time. 

11. INTEREST. This section explains (i) the interest rates that will apply to your account, (ii) when interest will be charged on your account, and (iii) how the amount of interest is calculated. 

A. Rates. The following rates apply to purchases, balance transfers, and cash advances. The Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account are shown in the table above and will also be shown on your billing statement. 

We calculate interest on the balance of your account each day. We use a daily rate to calculate the interest each day. The daily rate is equal to the APR divided by 365. All of the APRs and the daily rates on your account vary with the market based on the prime rate. The rates applied during a billing cycle are calculated based on the prime rate. The prime rate for a billing cycle is the highest bank prime loan rate published in The Wall Street Journal in its Money Rates section on the last business day of the calendar month preceding the first day of the billing cycle. 

1. Purchase Rate. 

For Premier Accounts: The daily rate for purchases is the prime rate plus 16.74%, times 1/365. As of June 1, 2010, the daily rate for purchases was .05477% (APR 19.99%). 

For Choice Accounts: The daily rate for purchases is the prime rate plus 23.74%, times 1/365. As of June 1, 2010, the daily rate for purchases was .07395% (APR 26.99%). 

2. Balance Transfer Rate. 

For Premier Accounts: The daily rate for balance transfers is the prime rate plus 16.74%, times 1/365. As of June 1, 2010, the daily rate for balance transfers was .05477% (APR 19.99%). 

For Choice Accounts: The daily rate for balance transfers is the prime rate plus 23.74%, times 1/365. As of June 1, 2010, the daily rate for balance transfers was .07395% (APR 26.99%). 

3. Cash Advance Rate. The daily rate for cash advances is the prime rate plus 23.74%, times 1/365. As of June 1, 2010, the daily rate for cash advances was .07395% (APR 26.99%). 

4. Daily Rates May Vary. If the prime rate increases, the daily rates (and corresponding APRs) may increase. As a result, interest, your total minimum payment and the number of payments it would take you to pay off your account balance may increase. We will apply any change in the daily rates because of a prime rate change to your entire account balance. A change in the prime rate will take effect on the first day of the billing cycle after the change. We may select a new interest rate index if the prime rate is not available. 

B. When We Charge Interest. We charge interest as described below. 

1. Purchases. We charge interest on your purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full, except as set forth below: 

� We will not charge you interest during a billing cycle on any purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the billing cycle or (ii) you had such a 
balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in that billing cycle. 

� We will credit, as of the beginning of the billing cycle, any payment you make by the due date that we allocate to purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the previous billing cycle, or (ii) if you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in the previous billing cycle. 

2. Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. We charge interest on your balance transfers and cash advances (and their related fees) from the date you make the transaction until you pay them in full. You cannot avoid paying interest on balance transfers or cash advances or on their fees. 

C. How We Calculate Interest. During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the daily rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 

To calculate the daily interest charge, we do the following steps each day for each balance type: 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 

We apply fees among various balance types as follows: 

(a) late payment fees are treated as new purchases; 
(b)debt cancellation fees are added proportionately to each balance; 
(c) cash advance and stop payment fees are added to the cash advance balance; 
(d)balance transfer fees are added to the balance transfer balance; and 
(e) foreign transaction fees are added to the purchase balance. 

� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 

� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 

Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. We charge a minimum of $2.00 of interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest and this charge is added proportionately to each balance type. 

12. FEES. We charge the following fees. The table at the beginning of this Agreement shows the amount of each fee. 

A. Monthly Maintenance Fee. The monthly maintenance fee will not be assessed for any billing cycle for which your ending balance is zero or a credit balance. 

B. Transaction Fees. 

1. A Balance Transfer Fee for each balance transfer you make. 

2. A Cash Advance Fee for each cash advance you get. For ATM cash advances, this fee is in addition to any fee the ATM owner may charge you for using the ATM. 

3. A Foreign Transaction Fee for purchases or cash advances you make in currencies other than U.S. dollars and/or in a country other than the U.S., whether or not the transaction was in a foreign currency. 

C. Penalty Fees. A Late Payment Fee if we do not receive at least the total minimum payment due on your account by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the due date. The amount of the Late Payment Fee will be based on your account balance on the date the Late Payment Fee is posted to your account. 

D. Other Fees. A Stop Payment Fee of $20. We charge this fee if we stop payment on any convenience check at your request. 

13. PAYMENTS. 

A. Required Payment and Crediting of Payment. Each billing cycle you must pay at least the total minimum payment by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the payment due date. You may at any time pay more than the total minimum payment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payment may reduce the amount of interest you will pay. Any payments received after 5:00 p.m. (ET) will be credited as of the next day. We may delay making credit available on your account in the amount of your payment. 

B. Minimum Payment. Your total minimum payment is the sum of the following: 
1. Any past due amounts; and 
2. The greater of either: 
(a) $20; or 
(b) the sum of (i) the interest, (ii) any late payment fees charged to your account in the current billing cycle and (iii) 1.0% of the new balance shown on your 
billing statement. 

We round up to the next highest whole dollar in figuring your total minimum payment. If your new balance on your billing statement is less than $20, then your total minimum payment will be equal to the new balance. 


C. How to Make a Payment. To make a payment you must follow all the instructions below and the instructions on your billing statement. If you do not, credit of your payment to your account may be delayed up to five days. 

1. Do the following: (a) make your payment in United States dollars by check, money order, or similar instrument from a bank located in the U.S.; (b) send the payment coupon from your billing statement with your payment; (c) send the payment and payment coupon in the envelope provided with your billing statement to the payment address listed on your billing statement; and (d) send only one payment and one payment coupon in each envelope. Alternatively you may make your payment online at the website address shown on your billing statement provided you make your payment in United States dollars from a bank located in the U.S. 

2. Do not do the following: (a) staple, paper clip, tape or fold your payment or payment coupon; (b) include any other papers or items with your payment; (c) use a balance transfer or convenience check from your account to pay us; or (d) send us cash. 

D. Other Ways to Make a Payment. We may allow you to make payments over the phone as an accommodation to you, but we may charge you a fee to do so. 

E. Disputed Amounts. If you send us correspondence about a disputed amount, you must send it to the address for billing inquiries shown on your billing statement. You may not send it to the payment address shown on your billing statement. By �disputed amount�, we mean a payment of less than the full balance on your account that is labeled as �payment in full� or similar language, or is given to us as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, or is given to us with other conditions or limitations. We may accept these types of payments without giving up any of our rights. 

F. Authorization. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. 

G. Payment Allocation. We reserve the right to select the method by which the required minimum payment is allocated to different balances on your account. Some or all of the required minimum payment on your account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. The payment allocation method that we use may result in higher interest on your account or reduced savings attributable to any special promotions. Any payment you make in excess of the required minimum payment will be allocated to balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs, unless applicable law requires or permits otherwise (such as when your account has a certain type of special promotion). 

14. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS. At times, we may offer you special promotions when you use your account for certain transactions. These special promotions will have some terms that are different from the terms in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement apply to any special promotion, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the special promotion. We may terminate your participation in any special promotion if you become more than 60 days late on any payment due on your account. If this happens, each special promotion balance will no longer be subject to the terms of the special promotion and will instead be subject to the terms of this Agreement. Please see any special promotion advertising (including in-store signs) or other disclosures provided to you for the full terms of any special promotion offered. 

15. CURRENCY CONVERSION. If you make a transaction with your account in a currency other than U.S. dollars, MasterCard will convert the transaction amount into U.S. dollars using its currency conversion procedure. Under the currency conversion procedure that MasterCard currently uses, the non-U.S. dollar transaction amount is converted into a U.S. dollar amount by multiplying the transaction amount in the non-U.S. dollar currency by a currency conversion rate. The currency conversion rate that MasterCard typically uses is either a government mandated rate, or a wholesale rate provided to MasterCard. The currency conversion rate that MasterCard uses for a particular transaction is the rate MasterCard uses for the applicable currency when the transaction is processed. This rate may differ from the rate in effect when the transaction occurred or when it was posted to your Account, and may be higher than the rate you could have gotten if you had converted U.S. dollars into the foreign currency. 

16. UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should call us immediately at: 1-866-423-3796. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use on your account. 

You agree that unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given your card or allowed use of your account. You will be responsible for all use by such a person.

23. DEFAULT. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, you are in default if you: 

� Make a late payment;

We may also reduce your credit limit or close your account at any time whether or not you are in default. 

24. COLLECTION COSTS. If we ask an attorney to collect your account, we may charge you our collection costs. Collection costs may include court costs and reasonable attorneys� fees. We will charge these costs only if the attorney we ask to collect is not our salaried employee and the law allows us to do so. 

25. DISPUTE AND CLAIM RESOLUTION (INCLUDING ARBITRATION) PROVISION.
 
General/Requirement to Arbitrate. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED.

Upon demand, and except as otherwise provided below, you and we must arbitrate individually any dispute or claim between you, any joint cardholder and/or any additional cardholder, on the one hand; and us, our affiliates, and agents, on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises from or relates to your Account. 

However, we will not require you to arbitrate: (1) any individual case in small claims court or your state�s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court; or (2) any claim by us that only involves our effort to collect money you owe us. However, if you respond to a collection lawsuit by claiming that we engaged in any wrongdoing, we may require you to arbitrate. 

YOU AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. ALSO, YOU MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ON BEHALF OF ANY CARDHOLDER WHO IS NOT A JOINT OR ADDITIONAL CARDHOLDER WITH YOU ON YOUR ACCOUNT (AN �UNRELATED CARDHOLDER�), AND YOU AGREE THAT NO UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY BRING ANY CLAIMS AGAINST US ON YOUR BEHALF. CLAIMS BY YOU AND BY AN UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY NOT BE JOINED IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. Only a court may decide whether any part of this paragraph is enforceable.

Variable Rate Information.

The following applies to any APR on your Account that varies with the market
based on the Prime Rate.  The APRs on your Account correspond to a Daily
Periodic Rate (""DPR"") or a Monthly Periodic Rate (""MPR"") which is applicable
only to residents of Iowa at the time of Account opening. The applicable
DPRs/MPRs on your Account equal 1/365th (or 1/12th for residents of Iowa at the
time of Account opening) of the sum of 1) the applicable Prime Rate, 2) plus
the margin(s) listed above for each Purchase, Balance Transfer, or Cash Advance
balance or the margin listed above if a Penalty APR applies. The ""Prime Rate""
used in determining the APRs in each billing cycle will be the highest rate
published in the Money Rates column of The Wall Street Journal on the last
business day of each month.  An increase or decrease in the Prime Rate will
cause a corresponding increase or decrease to your variable rates on the first
day of the billing cycle that begins in the same month in which the applicable
Prime Rate is published.  There is no limitation on the amount of any increase.
 Any such increase or decrease will cause a corresponding increase or decrease
in the amount of interest assessed and possibly in the amount of the Minimum
Payment Due.  If The Wall Street Journal does not publish the U.S. Prime Rate,
or if it changes the definition of the U.S. Prime Rate, we may substitute
another index.  As of 09-30-2011 the Prime Rate was 3.25%.

How the Penalty APR may apply to Your Account.

The APRs on your Account may be increased each time you, on this Account or any
other account you may have with us, fail to make a payment to us when due, you
fail to pay at least the Minimum Payment Due, you exceed your credit line, or
you make a payment that is not honored by your bank.  If we increase the APRs
on your Account, we will notify you in advance of the increase.  The Penalty
APR that will be applied to your Account will be determined based on our review
of your credit history at the time of our review (including your credit
performance with other creditors). Our notice to you will include the effective
date of the APR increase and the balances to which the Penalty APR will be
applied.   If the Penalty APR is applied to your account, it may continue to
apply to new transactions indefinitely. However, the Penalty APR will cease to
apply to certain existing transactions if, after the Penalty APR goes into
effect, you make the next six consecutive minimum payments in a row when due.
If you do not make these six consecutive minimum payments, the Penalty APR may
continue to apply to new and existing transactions indefinitely.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance Subject to Interest Rate:

We use a method called ""daily balance (including new purchases)"". To determine
the amount of the interest to be charged on your Account we first calculate the
""Balance Subject to Interest Rate"" separately for Purchases, for Balance
Transfers, and for Cash Advances.  We apply the applicable DPR to each of the
applicable daily balances for  i) Purchases, ii) Balance Transfers and iii)
Cash Advances.  The daily balances for Purchases, for Balance Transfers and for
Cash Advances are each calculated separately and determined as follows: We take
the beginning balances for each transaction type on your Account each day,
including any interest calculated on the previous day's balance, add to the
respective balances any new transaction, subtract any payments or credits and
make any other applicable adjustment(s). This Agreement provides for
compounding of interest. A credit balance is treated as a balance of zero. If
you multiply the ""Balance Subject to Interest Rate"" for each balance category
as shown on your monthly billing statement by the number of days in the billing
period and then multiply each sum by the applicable DPRs, the results will be
the interest assessed, except for minor variations caused by rounding.  We may
from time to time offer you ""introductory,"" ""special"" or ""promotional"" APR
offers. If any are in effect on your Account  we will separately identify the
balances to which such offers apply on your monthly billing statement. These
separate balances and the related interest will be calculated in the same
manner as described above.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance Subject to Interest Rate (For Residents of
Iowa at the Time of Account Opening):

We use a method called ""average daily balance (including new purchases)"".  To
determine the amount of the interest to be charged on your Account we first
calculate the ""Balance Subject to Interest Rate"" separately for Purchases, for
Balance Transfers, and for Cash Advances.  We apply the applicable Monthly
Periodic Rate to the average daily balances of i) Purchases, ii) Balance
Transfers, and iii) Cash Advances. The average daily balances for Purchases,
for Balance Transfers, and for Cash Advances are calculated separately and
determined as follows:  We take the beginning balances for each balance
category on your Account each day, add to the respective balances any new
transaction, subtract any payments or credits and make any other applicable
adjustment(s). A credit balance is treated as a balance of zero. Then we take
the sum of all daily balances and divide by the number of days in the billing
period to determine the average daily balance. If you multiply the ""Balance
Subject to Interest Rate"" for each balance category as disclosed on your
monthly billing statement by the applicable MPRs, the results will be the
interest assessed, except for minor variations caused by rounding.  We may from
time to time offer you ""introductory,"" ""special"" or ""promotional"" APR offers.
If any are in effect on your Account  we will separately identify the balances
to which such offers apply on your monthly billing statement. These separate
balances and the related interest will be calculated in the same manner as
described above.

Accrual of Interest and How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases.

On Purchases, interest begins to accrue as of the transaction date. However,
you may avoid paying interest on Purchases in any given billing cycle if you
pay your Statement Balance in full by the Payment Due Date each month.  For
Balance Transfers, interest will accrue from the day we send the Balance
Transfer to the payee.  For Checks, interest will accrue on the day the payee
accepts the Check.  For Cash Advances, interest will accrue from the day you
take the Cash Advance.  If you are charged interest in a billing cycle, we will
charge a Minimum Interest Charge (or ""Minimum Charge"") on your Account if the
total interest charge in that billing cycle is less than the amount of the
Minimum Interest Charge that is disclosed in the Account Summary Table.

Using Your Account/Acceptance of These Terms.

You do not need to accept the Account and this Agreement and none of the fees
on this Account (except as otherwise provided herein) will apply unless you use
the Account.  If your Account has an Annual Fee (see the Account Summary Table
to determine if this Account has an Annual Fee) and provided that you have not
otherwise used the Account to make a Purchase, Balance Transfer or Cash Advance
or paid the Annual Fee, you may close the Account within thirty days after
Account opening by contacting us at the number on the back of your Card, and if
you do, you will not be responsible for paying the Annual Fee.  By signing,
keeping, using or otherwise accepting your Card or Account, you agree to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. You may obtain credit in the form of
Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances by using your Card, your account
number, Checks, or other credit devices. You agree that we may credit your
Account rather than issue cash refunds when you reverse transactions that were
originally charged to your Account. You agree that you will not use your Card
or Account in connection with any transaction that is prohibited or
unenforceable and that if you do engage in such a transaction you waive any
claim that the charge is uncollectible on the grounds the transaction was
prohibited or unenforceable. The Card must be returned to us upon request. We
may replace your Card with another Card at anytime.

Obligations on Your Account.

You authorize us to pay and charge your Account for all Purchases, Balance
Transfers, Checks, and Cash Advances made or obtained by you or anyone you
authorize to use your Card or Account. You agree to pay us for all of these
Purchases, Balance Transfers, Checks, and Cash Advances, plus any interest
assessed on your Account and any other charges and fees which you may owe under
the terms of this Agreement, whether resulting from 1) physical use of your
Card or a Check, 2) mail order or telephone, computer or other electronic
transaction made without presenting the Card, or 3) any other circumstances
where you authorize a charge, or authorize someone else to make a charge, to
your Account.  Each person who has agreed to be responsible on the Account is
responsible to pay the full amount owed on the Account.  If this is a joint
Account, we can send statements and notices to either of you. We may require
that you pay the full amount owed without first asking any other person(s) to
pay. Instructions for making payments are on your monthly billing statement.
Payments that comply with the requirements specified on or with your monthly
billing statement, including the time of receipt, will be credited on the
business day they are received. Payments must be mailed to the correct P.O. Box
or street address specified for U.S. Priority Mail and overnight payments.
There may be a delay of up to five (5) days in crediting payments that are not
made in accordance with those instructions.  Please allow at least seven (7)
days for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver your payment.  All payments must be
made in U.S. dollars. Any payment made by check or other negotiable instrument
or direct debit must be drawn on a U.S. bank or a U.S. branch of a foreign
bank. We reserve the right to accept payments made in a foreign currency. If we
do, we will select the foreign currency rate at our discretion.  Your available
credit may not be immediately increased by the amount of the payment for up to
seven (7) days to ensure we collect the funds from the bank on which your
payment is drawn.  If you overpay or if there is a credit balance on your
Account, we will not pay interest on such amounts.

Credit Line/Authorized Usage.

Your credit line is shown on the folder containing your Card. We may change
your credit line from time to time-either increase or decrease it-in our sole
discretion.  If at any time (including in the first month after your Account is
opened) you engage in account actions or activity that we perceive could have a
negative impact on your credit standing with us, we may decrease your credit
line or close your Account. Your latest credit line will appear on your monthly
billing statement.  You agree not to make a Purchase, authorize a Balance
Transfer, use a Check, or obtain a Cash Advance that would cause the unpaid
balance of your Account to exceed your credit line. We may honor Purchases,
Balance Transfers, Checks and/or Cash Advances in excess of your credit line at
our sole discretion. If we do, this Agreement applies to that excess and you
agree to pay the excess immediately if we request that you do so. You agree
that we may change or cancel your credit line at any time for any reason
without affecting your obligation to pay amounts that you owe under this
Agreement.  We will notify you of any change, but the change may take effect
before you receive the notice.  We may designate that only a portion of your
credit line is available for Cash Advances.  If we do and you exceed your line,
you will be considered to have exceeded your credit line for all purposes of
this Agreement. We may limit the authorizations to make Purchase, Balance
Transfer, Check, or Cash Advance transactions that may be accomplished with
your Card or Account.  If you are approved for an account that does not have a
preset spending limit please see the Addendum to the Cardmember Agreement
addendum for additional information about your credit line and the usage of
your Account.

Checks on Your Account.

We may issue Checks on your Account in the form of ""Balance Transfer Checks"" or
""Cash Advance Checks,"" which can be used to access your credit line.   Each
Check will contain your Account number and may be used only by the person(s)
whose name(s) is/are printed on it.  Each must be completed and signed in the
same manner as a regular personal check. If we provide Checks to you, you may
not use them to pay any amount you owe under this Agreement or under any other
account you may have with us. Balance Transfer Checks and Cash Advance Checks
are subject to the same rate and other terms under this Agreement as Balance
Transfers and Cash Advances, respectively.  Unless otherwise indicated, all
references in this Agreement to Balance Transfers include Balance Transfer
Checks, all references to Cash Advances include Cash Advance Checks, and all
references to use of the Account include use of these Checks.  At our sole
discretion we may elect to not honor a Check if there has been a change in your
credit worthiness, your account is not in good standing or if the Check may
cause your account to exceed the Cash Advance or other applicable credit line
on your Account.  At our sole discretion we may elect to honor a Check after
its expiration date. Unlike purchase transactions, there are no charge back
rights with regard to Balance Transfer and Check transactions.

Monthly Billing Statements.

At the end of each monthly billing cycle a statement will be mailed or
delivered to you if your Account has a debit or credit balance of more than
$1.00 or if interest or a fee has been imposed. We will not send a monthly
billing statement if we deem your Account uncollectible or if delinquency
collection proceedings have been instituted by us sending your Account to an
outside collection agency or attorney for collection.

Your Minimum Payment Each Month.

Each billing cycle, you must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due shown on your
monthly statement by its Payment Due Date.  If the Statement Balance shown on
your monthly statement is less than $20, your Minimum Payment Due (due by the
Payment Due Date) will be that Statement Balance amount. Otherwise, if your
Statement Balance is equal to or greater than $20, your Minimum Payment Due
will be the greater of $20 or the total of (1) 1% of the Principal Balance
(defined as the total Statement Balance minus any interest charges, Returned
Payment Fees, and Late Payment Fees that are incurred during the current
billing cycle), plus (2) interest charges incurred during the current billing
cycle (for this purpose, interest charges incurred do not include interest
charges that accrued during prior billing cycles on a deferred interest balance
(if there are any on your Account) that ended during the billing cycle covered
by the statement), plus (3) any Returned Payment Fees and any Late Payment Fees
incurred during the current billing cycle, plus (4) if we so elect, any amount
past due and/or amount over your credit line at the time of billing. In certain
instances your Minimum Payment Due may be less than your total fees and
interest assessed in that billing cycle. At any time you may pay more than the
Minimum Payment Due up to the full amount you owe us, however you cannot ""pay
ahead"".  This means that if you pay more than the required Minimum Payment Due
in any billing cycle or if you make more than one payment in a billing cycle,
you will still need to pay the next month's required Minimum Payment Due by
your next Payment Due Date.

Transaction Fees.

If you use your Card or Account to obtain a Cash Advance, we will charge a Cash
Advance Fee  for each such Cash Advance. If you use your Card or Account to do
a Balance Transfer, we will charge a Balance Transfer Fee for each such Balance
Transfer. If you use your Card or Account to purchase Cash Equivalents, we will
charge a Cash Advance Fee (sometimes we may refer to this as a Cash Equivalent
Fee) for each such transaction. If you use your Card or Account for a Foreign
Transaction, we will charge a Foreign Transaction Fee for each such
transaction.  Balance Transfer Checks and Cash Advance Checks are subject to
the same Transaction Fee as Balance Transfers and Cash Advances, respectively.
The present amounts of those charges are stated in the Supplement.

Account Fees.
In addition to the fees listed in the Account Summary Table, we may also assess
the Account Fees listed below.

CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
1. GENERAL: Each person signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application for a credit card account (“Account”) as applicant or joint applicant applies for an Account with HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., a national banking association, and requests one or more credit card(s) bearing the name or tradename of Polaris® StarCard to be used in connection with the Account. The word “Card” means any credit card(s) issued to you or an authorized user of your Account. 
In this Agreement, the words “you” and “your” refer to the applicant and joint applicant named on the credit card application and the words “we”, “us” and “our” refer to HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., located at 1111 Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144.
If your application is approved, “applicant” will be referred to as “primary cardholder” and “joint applicant” will be referred to as “secondary cardholder” for purposes of this agreement.
If we accept your application to open an Account, you agree that you will only purchase goods and services for personal, family and household purposes from merchants which honor the Card.
2. ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT: By a) signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application, using or permitting others to use the Card, b) signing or permitting others to sign sales slips; or 
c) making or permitting others to make purchases by telephone, Internet, or any other means, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Cardholder Agreement and Disclosure Statement, which includes an arbitration provision.
3. PROMISE TO PAY: You agree to pay all amounts charged to the Account, whether incurred by you or anyone you authorize or permit to use your Account or Card. If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.
4. ABILITY TO REPAY: When you use the Account or permit others to use the Account, you represent that you have the ability and intention to repay all amounts charged to the Account.
5. BILLING STATEMENT: We will send you a billing statement monthly for each billing cycle at the end of which you have a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00, or in which a Interest Charge has been imposed. The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other charges or fees, including credit insurance or debt cancellation (if applicable), and all payments and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle. The billing statement will show the amount owed on your Account. The total Amount owed is called “New Balance” on your billing statement subject to the terms of Promotional Credit Plan purchases, if any, as indicated below.
6. PROMOTIONAL CREDIT PLANS: The following Promotional Credit Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase:   a) Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan – no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase for a specified period, as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; b) Same As Cash/Monthly Payment Credit Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase before the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, Interest Charges will be imposed from the purchase date; c) Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; d) Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan – A special repayment factor will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; e) Special Repayment Factor/Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A special repayment factor and a reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle. Promotional Credit Plans are available only for transactions on which the total amount financed is less than 130% of the MSRP for the unit. All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Credit Plan are referred to as Regular Credit Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Card. Call 1-888-367-4310 or review the Application of Payments section of this Agreement for information.
7. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(iv) a purchase on a Same As Cash Credit Plan if the full cash sales price is paid in full before the promotion expiration date.
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan other than a Same As Cash Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Same As Cash Credit Plan during a cycle, the amount will be the sum of the following daily Interest Charge calculations for the Credit Plan during the current cycle and during each of the prior billing cycles (each a “Prior Cycle”) from the transaction date of the purchase through the current cycle: (i) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for the Current Cycle times the Daily Balance for each day in the current cycle; and (ii) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for each Prior Cycle times the Daily Balances of the Credit Plan for each day during each Prior Cycle.
(e) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) incurred on that day and 4) any late fees, over the credit limit fees, returned payment fees or other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. For any Same As Cash Credit Plan, credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) are not included in the Daily Balance of that Credit Plan during the promotional period. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(f) The Daily Periodic Rate which is used to determine your Interest Charges and the corresponding Annual Percentage Rate, will be variable rates which may change monthly. The Daily Periodic Rate will be one-three hundred sixty fifth of the sum of the U.S. prime rate published in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal that is in effect on the last day of the month (“Prime Rate”) plus a “Spread” of 18.74 percentage points for the Standard Rate and a “Spread” of 25.74 percentage points for the Penalty Rate. Any changes in the Prime Rate will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle beginning in the next month. 
For example, as of the billing cycle beginning September 1, 2011, the Interest Charge for the Standard Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .06025% (corresponding 21.99% Annual Percentage Rate) and the Interest Charge for the Penalty Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .07942% (corresponding 28.99% Annual Percentage Rate). An increase in the Prime Rate will increase your applicable Daily Periodic Rate which may increase the Interest Charge and the Minimum Payment due on your Account. Your APR may increase to the Penalty APR if we fail to receive your minimum payment with in 60 days when due. You will no longer be eligible for the Standard Rate and all existing Promotional Credit Plans will terminate, and your entire Account balance will be subject to the Penalty Rate. If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the new Penalty APR goes into effect.  If you make the next six consecutive on time minimum payments starting with your first payment due once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APR(s) applicable to your Account.  If you do not make these six consecutive on time minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.
8. MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE: A minimum Interest Charge of $2.00 will be assessed for each billing cycle in which an Interest Charge is payable.
9. FEES: We may impose on your Account the following fees, which will be added to your Account when assessed:
a)	Late Payment Fee: A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
	The amount of the Late Payment Fee is shown in the chart below.  In no event will your Late Payment Fee exceed the amount of your Minimum Payment Due.

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - Up to and including $100
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $15
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $15

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $100 and up to and including $1000
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $35

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $1000
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $35
b)	Returned Payment Fee: A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
	Your Returned Payment Fee is $25.
	In no event will your Returned Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
c)	Research Fees: A Research Fee may be assessed to the Account for each copy of a requested document. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such copies are requested.
d)	Reissued Card Fee: You may be charged $5 each time you request that your credit card be reissued.
e)	Payment by phone fee: A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment is requested.
f)	Over the Credit Limit Fee: In the event you exceed your credit limit, you will be charged an Over the Credit Limit Fee of $0.
g)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
10. INSURANCE: If available and you elect any credit insurance coverage, you authorize us to charge the insurance premium for such insurance to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the insurance premium is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the premium is being assessed. Credit insurance charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
11. DEBT CANCELLATION: If available and you elect debt cancellation, you authorize us to charge the fee for such debt cancellation to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the debt cancellation fee is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the fee is being assessed. Debt cancellation charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
12. MINIMUM PAYMENT: You agree to pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due. Your Minimum Payment due is equal to your Minimum Payment plus the Special Repayment Factor for any Promotional Credit Plans with a special repayment factor plus any debt cancellation fees or credit insurance premiums attributable to any Reduced Rate/Special Repayment Factor Credit plans plus any delinquent amounts. The Minimum Payment is the greater of a.) $25 or b.) 1% of your “New Balance” (which does not include balances on Special Repayment Factor Credit Plans) plus billed Interest Charges plus any Late Fees assessed for that month, rounded to the next highest dollar. Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments, which may affect crediting of your payments.
13. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) not drawn in U.S. dollars on funds on deposit in the U.S.; (b) missing a signature; (c) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (d) restrictively endorsed; (e) postdated; (f) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (g) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to HSBC Retail Services, P.O. Box 5226, Carol Stream, IL 60197-5226. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
14. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances.  If you have a Same As Cash Credit Plan(s), we will automatically apply payments received during the final two complete billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first to the required Minimum Payment Due and next to the plan(s) that is expiring, in the order of expiration; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0% APR for purposes of determining payment application.
15. CREDIT LIMIT: You agree not to let the Account balance exceed the credit limit established for you by us from time to time. We do not have to honor any use of your Card or honor credit card checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit, but if we do, you agree to repay the amount by which your credit limit is exceeded, plus Interest Charges immediately.
16. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of any merchant to accept or honor the Card or a credit card check.
17. SECURITY: Except as described below, we will release the purchase money security interest in a good purchased using the Account when sufficient payments have been made to repay the portion of the balance on the Account attributable to the purchase of the good. Our allocation of your payments to the balance(s) on the Account is subject to federal regulations. In some cases, this may result in some or all of your payments being allocated to other balances on the Account (including those balances which may pertain to a purchase money security interest in a different good, or goods, purchased using the Account). You may contact us by calling the customer service number associated with the Account to request that we reallocate payments (including future payments) solely for purposes of releasing the purchase money security interest in a particular good (“Release Good”). We reserve the right to honor your request, solely at our discretion. We may deny your request, for example, if we believe that a different allocation will provide us greater protection. If we honor the request, it may result in your payments (including previous payments) being allocated in a manner that delays our release of a purchase money security interest in any other good(s) purchased with the Account, and for which there is a balance outstanding, until your payments are allocated in a manner that results in a release of our purchase money security interest in the Release Good.
18. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your moving out of the U.S. or Canada or providing us with a non-U.S. or non-Canadian mailing address; (l) your becoming incompetent; (m) your exceeding your credit limit; (n) your payment being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (o) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (p) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.
19. ARBITRATION: 
Federal Arbitration Act
This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1 - 16 (the ""FAA""). The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and provide written reasoned findings of fact and conclusions of law upon written request as set forth in the applicable arbitration association procedures. The arbitrator's award shall not be subject to appeal except as permitted by the FAA. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Claims and Arbitration Administrators
This arbitration provision shall apply to any Claim (defined below) by or against us, or you or any other Covered Person (defined below). You agree any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether based upon contract; tort, intentional or otherwise; constitution; statute; common law; or equity and whether preexisting, present or future), including initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third party claims, arising from or relating to (a) this Agreement, the application, your Account, any transaction or activity involving any payment or failure to make payment on your Account, or any solicitation, advertisement, promotion, or oral or written statements related to this Agreement or your Account, (b) the relationships which result from this Agreement and your relationship with any Covered Person pursuant to the criteria in the immediately preceding subsection or (c) the scope, validity or enforceability of this arbitration clause, any part thereof or the entire Agreement (any of the forgoing a ""Claim""), shall be resolved, upon the election of you, us, or any other Covered Person described below, by binding arbitration pursuant to this arbitration provision and the applicable rules or procedures of the arbitration administrator (the “Administrator”) selected at the time the Claim is filed or received by a party to the Claim. The party initiating the arbitration proceeding shall have the right to select one of the following Administrators: Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) or the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). The arbitrator shall be a lawyer with more than ten years experience or a retired or former judge. The rules and forms of JAMS and AAA may be obtained by writing to these organizations at the addresses listed under Further Information below. Our address for service of process under this provision is HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., P.O. Box 98740, Las Vegas, NV 89193-8740.
Small Claims Exemption
We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim you may bring in small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration at such time.
Location of Arbitration and Fees
Any participatory arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient to you.  On any Claim you file, you will pay the first $50 of the filing fee. At your request we will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the Administrator on any Claim submitted by you in arbitration up to a maximum of $1,500. If you are required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, we will consider a request by you to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, we shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees unless the arbitrator grants you an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in your favor, we will reimburse you for any additional fees paid or owed by you to the Administrator up  to the amount of the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual award in your favor. The parties shall bear the expense of their respective attorney's fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, or the fees paid to the Administrator, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein. If the arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the Administrator or for which we are responsible.
Covered Persons
This arbitration provision covers Claims by or against (a) us, any corporate parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, any predecessor or successor of the foregoing, and any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of any of the aforementioned, (b) you and any authorized user, and any other person claiming through you or any authorized user, and (c) any other person assisting us in offering Cards, administering Accounts or providing Card related benefits or services (“Covered Persons”). If a Claim that is within the scope of the first paragraph of the “Claims and Arbitration Administrators” paragraph above is advanced by or against any third person, and any of the persons mentioned in the previous sentence is involved as a party, then the entire Claim is s­ubject to arbitration under this Agreement, including any Claim by or against any third person.
Protection of Information
The rules and procedures of the Administrator, which you may obtain from that organization, shall govern the arbitration unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will control. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, nor to state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. If you or we request, the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized under applicable law and will use best efforts to protect confidential information (including through use of protective orders).
Parties to Arbitration
Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.”
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver.  You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules. In the event of such an appeal, an appeal panel consisting of three arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The panel's decision will be final and binding. Any final decision of the arbitrator or of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as provided under the FAA. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the FAA by any court having jurisdiction.

(i) ACCOUNT 

This is the Agreement that covers your Banco Popular North America MasterCard credit card account 
(called your �Account�) with us. In this Agreement, and in your Account Statements (each, an 
�Account Statement�), the words �you� and �your� refer to all persons named on the credit card 
application, credit card, or acceptance form, as well as their heirs and executors, and the words �we�, 
�us� and �our� and �Bank� refer to Banco Popular North America. 


 

You can use your credit card (�Card�) to purchase goods and services at participating merchants and 
to take Cash Advances as described in this Agreement. You agree not to use your Card for any 
unlawful purpose. If you use, or allow someone else to use, any card associated with your Account for 
any other purpose, you will be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us and 
MasterCard� International Incorporated (�MasterCard�) for all amounts or expenses either Banco 
Popular North America or MasterCard pays as a result of such use. 

 

(ii) PROMISE TO PAY 

You promise to pay for (a) credit extended by Banco Popular North America, to you or to anyone 
whom you permit to use any Card associated with your Account; (b) INTEREST CHARGES, late 
charges, and any other fees or administrative charges (e.g., returned check charges) provided in this 
Agreement; and (c) collection costs and attorneys' fees as permitted by applicable law if your Account 
should go into default. 

 

(iii) CASH ADVANCES 

The term �Cash Advance� includes the following transactions: (1) Automated Teller Machine (ATM) 
transactions; (2) convenience check transactions; (3) money orders, cashiers checks, travelers 
checks, wire transfers, foreign currency or other in-bank transactions; (4) tax payments; (5) certain 
permitted gambling transactions; and (6) court costs, bail bonds and fines. Convenience checks are 
used the same as personal checks and are drawn from your Account and billed on your monthly 
Account Statement. 

 

(iv) CREDIT LIMIT 

You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases 
and Cash Advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon 
receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each Account 
Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit 
limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you 
exceed your authorized credit limit, the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return 
or forfeit the Card and close the Account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, 
shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized 
credit limit. 

 

(v) INTEREST CHARGES 

Monthly INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on all balances on this Account. The INTEREST 
CHARGE applied to purchases and balance transfers from other institutions will be based on variable 
Annual Percentage Rates (�APR�). This APR can increase or decrease for each billing period. Different 
APRs can apply to purchases, Cash Advances, balance transfers from other institutions, and 
convenience checks. Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for specific APRs related to your 
Account. 

Variable APRs will be determined by adding the United States Prime Rate as published in The Wall 
Street Journal (�Prime Rate�) to a margin. There is no pre-set limit on rate increases. The amount of 
your margins and current APRs are disclosed in the accompanying card mailer. We determine the 
margins applicable to your Account based on your credit history at the time of approval of your Card 
application. An increase in the Prime Rate will cause an increase in your APR, the INTEREST CHARGE 
and your minimum payment. 

The �Daily Periodic Rate� is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances and is determined 
by dividing the APR by 365 and rounding up. For each billing period, the APR will be based on the 
Prime Rate published two business days prior to the Account Statement/closing date for that billing 
period. In the event the Prime Rate is not available as of that date, we may substitute a similar 
published rate that is outside of our control. To the extent permitted by law, any change in your APR 
will apply to the existing balance on your Account and to new transactions. 

The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances. The INTEREST 
CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the 
number of days in the billing period. 

The Average Daily Balance for purchases is obtained by taking into account the initial daily balance on 
purchases, plus any new purchases, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on purchases, and any 
other fees and charges that we add that day, minus any payments and credits we apply to the 
purchase balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the 
total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. New purchases are added to the daily 
balance on posting date, unless we elect to use a later date. Purchases will begin to accrue INTEREST 
CHARGES on the date of posting. No INTEREST CHARGE will be imposed on a purchase added to your 
daily balance during the billing cycle covered by the Account Statement if that Account Statement 
shows no previous balance or shows that the previous balance was paid in full by its payment due 
date. Also, no additional INTEREST CHARGE will be charged on any purchases included in the new 
balance of a monthly Account Statement if you pay the new balance in full on or before the date 
specified in your Account Statement. The payment due date will be 25 days or more, depending upon 
the payment due date on your Account. 

The Average Daily Balance for Cash Advances is obtained by taking into account the initial daily 
balance on Cash Advances, plus any new Cash Advances, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on 
Cash Advances, and any other Cash Advance fees that we add that day, minus any payments and 
credits we apply to the Cash Advance balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing 
period are added and the total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. The INTEREST 


CHARGE on Cash Advances, balance transfers and convenience checks will be imposed from the date 
the transaction is conducted. There is no �free ride� period for such transactions. 

Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for other terms which are made a part of this 
Agreement. 

 

(vi) ANNUAL FEE 

If applicable, the annual fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is 
issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the first Card. Please refer to the 
accompanying card mailer for specific annual fee information related to your Account. 

 

(vii) MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 

We will not impose any late charges or penalty fees if you pay at least the minimum payment 
reflected on your Account Statement by the specified �Payment Due� date. If you wish, you may pay 
more than the minimum payment and at any time you may pay the entire amount due for the current 
billing cycle. Send payments to Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 
2938, Milwaukee, WI 53201-2938. 

 

Your payment will be credited as of the day we receive it, subject to any applicable cutoff hour. The

will not accrue. If your payment due date falls on a weekend or legal federal holiday, the payment 
received will be credited to the account on the next business day and will not be considered late. If your 
payment is received after the payment cutoff time on the due date or any time thereafter, a late 
payment fee will be charged to your Account. Please refer to the back of your card mailer for more 
details regarding the minimum monthly payment and other important terms applicable to your Account. 

 

(viii) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS 

If you pay the required minimum payment of the monthly Account Statement, the payment shall be 
applied in the following way: first to INTEREST CHARGES and the rest shall be applied first to the 
debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances, with the lowest APR and then to the debt with the 
higher APR in ascending order. Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until 
the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required 
payment, the excess shall be applied first to the debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances 
with the highest APR and then to the debt with the lowest APR in descending order. 

 

All payments by mail must be made by check or money order. Payments may not be made by 
attempting to effect a transfer or by using a convenience check from this Account or from any other 
Banco Popular North America credit card account. You agree that any payment you make may be, 
but is not required to be, returned to you without applying it to your Account and without 
presentment or protest, for reasons including, but not limited to, that the check or money order: (1) 
is missing a signature; (2) is drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (3) contains a 
restrictive endorsement; (4) is post dated; (5) is not payable to Banco Popular North America; (6) is 
not payable in U.S. dollars; (7) is not paid upon presentment; or (8) results from an attempted 
transfer or is drawn on a convenience check. You agree to pay any Bank collection fees we incur for 
any check payments made in U.S. dollars drawn on a financial institution not located in the United 
States. All payments made by mail under this Agreement must be received at the address specified 
on your Account Statement. 

 

Any conditional check, money order or any other instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a 
disputed debt or as an accord and satisfaction or containing a restrictive endorsement must be sent 
to us at the Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 2938, Milwaukee, 
WI 53201-2938. You must note conspicuously on the face of the payment that it is tendered for this 
purpose. If you make a payment in any other manner and we accept it, we will not have waived our 
rights to collect any amounts owed under this Agreement. Even though your payment may be posted 
to your Account, we may not restore your available credit or Cash Advance available credit 
immediately. 

 

(ix) MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENT 

The Bank shall mail to you a monthly Account Statement at the end of each billing period in which 
you have a balance in excess of $1. You must notify the Bank, in writing, of any error in the Account 
Statement, within sixty (60) days, following the date on which the Account Statement was mailed. 

 

(x) FEES 

Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

a. Penalty fee: A late fee will be added to the standard purchase balance for each billing period you 
fail to pay by its due date the minimum payment due. Returned payment fees may also be charged. 

 

b. Currency conversion fee: If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, other than a cash 
advance made at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, MasterCard will convert the charge into a U.S. 
dollar amount. MasterCard currently uses a conversion rate in effect one day prior to its transaction 
processing date. Such rate is either a wholesale market rate or the government-mandated rate. 
Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

 


If you make a Cash Advance in a foreign currency at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, the 
amount is converted into U.S. dollars by our affiliate in accordance with its foreign currency 
conversion procedures then in effect. Our affiliate currently uses a conversion rate in effect on its 
applicable processing date. Such rate is either a mid-point market rate or the government-mandated 
rate. 

 

The foreign currency conversion rate in effect on the applicable processing date for a transaction may 
differ from the rate in effect on the sale or post date on your Account Statement for that transaction. 

 

If a transaction is converted by a third party prior to such transaction being processed by MasterCard, 
the foreign currency conversion rate for that transaction will be the rate selected by that third party. 

 

c. Administrative charges: We may charge you a fee to take advantage of certain optional 
administrative services we provide our Cardmembers such as copy of Account Statements, additional 
credit cards or express delivery services. Each time an administrative service is offered to you, any 
fee for the service will be reflected on your Account Statement. You agree to pay the fee disclosed 
each time you opt to take advantage of an administrative service. These services are optional and are 
not required to be used by you.

INTEREST CHARGES at the contract rate. Balances outstanding under this Agreement when your 
credit line is reduced or terminated will continue to accrue INTEREST CHARGES until paid in full and 
subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. Upon default, we have the right to terminate or 
suspend your credit privileges under this Agreement, to change the terms of your Account and this 
Agreement, may require you to pay your entire Account balance including all accrued but unpaid 
charges immediately as permitted by law and to sue you for what you owe. You will pay our court, 
reasonable attorney's fees and other collection costs related to the default to the extent permitted by

order set forth under Application of Payments. We may continue to impose INTEREST CHARGES after 
default (including charge-off). 

 

(xii) CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS

responsible for any refusal to accept or honor your Card. We can cancel your Account, refuse to allow 
further transactions, or revoke your Card at any time.

unauthorized use of your Card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify 
us of the loss, theft or possible unauthorized use. Notification must be given by you immediately

principles), whether or not you live in Florida, and whether or not your Account is used outside of 
Florida, and by any applicable federal laws. You agree that: (1) this Agreement is entered into in 
Florida; (2) all credit under this Agreement will be extended from Florida; and (3) all credit extended 
under this Agreement is subject to, and governed by, Florida law. All terms and conditions of this

Application of Payment and Fee provisions) are deemed to be material to a determination of the 
INTEREST CHARGE.

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS: Keep this Document for Future Use 

 

This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing 
Act. 

 

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Account Statement 

If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, write to us at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

In your letter, give us the following information: 

� Account information: Your name and account number. 
� Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
� Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, describe what 
you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. 


 

You must contact us: 

� Within 60 days after the error appeared on your Account Statement. 
� At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment 
on the amount you think is wrong. 


 

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not 
required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 

 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 

When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 

1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also 
tell you if we have already corrected the error. 

2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we 
believe the Account Statement is correct. 

 

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 

� We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
� The charge in question may remain on your Account Statement, and we may continue to impose 
INTEREST CHARGES on that amount. 
� While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your 
balance. 
� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 


 

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 

� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any INTEREST CHARGES 
or other fees related to that amount. 



� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with 
applicable INTEREST CHARGES and fees. We will send you an Account Statement of the amount 
you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the 
amount we think you owe. 


 

If you receive our explanation but still believe your Account Statement is wrong, you must write to us 
within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent 
without also reporting that you are questioning your Account Statement. We must tell you the name 
of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when 
the matter has been settled between us. 

 

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you 
question even if your Account Statement is correct. 

 

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Card Purchases 

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your Card and you 
have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay 
the remaining amount due on the purchase. 

 

To use this right, all of the following must be true: 

1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing 
address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. 

(Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to 
you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 

2. You must have used your Card for the purchase. Purchases made with Cash Advances from an 
ATM or with a check that accesses your Account do not qualify. 

3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 

 

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in 
writing at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we 
finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount 
and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We will use a method called �average daily balance (including new purchases).�  See your account agreement for more details.

Variable Rate: After the introductory rate period, the variable APR for purchases and balance transfers will equal the sum of the Prime Rate as listed in the Money Rates section of the Eastern edition of The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of each month, plus a margin of 17.99%, subject to a maximum of the lesser of 18.00% APR or the highest APR then permitted by applicable law. The variable APR for cash advances will equal the sum of the Prime Rate, plus a margin of 17.99%, subject to a maximum of the lesser of 18.00% APR or the highest APR then permitted by applicable law. 

Periodic Rates and Corresponding APRs: During the introductory period of 6 months, the monthly Periodic Rate for purchases and balance transfers is 0.333% which is an APR of 3.99%. After that, assuming no change in the Prime Rate, the monthly Periodic Rate for purchases and balance transfers will be 1.5%, which is an APR of 18.00%. The initial monthly Periodic Rate for cash advances is 1.50%, which is an APR of 18.00%.

Billing Rights: Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided in your account agreement.



VISA� PLATINUM AND VISA� PLATINUM REWARDS VARIABLE RATE                                                  CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE

DEFINITIONS: �Card� means the VISA� Platinum Credit Card or VISA� Platinum Rewards Credit Card, as the case may be, which we issue to you under this agreement, including any duplicates or renewals, and includes any device or check used to obtain credit or cash from the account. The words �you�, �your�, and �Cardholder� mean each person jointly and individually who holds, signs, retains, uses, or permits others to use or sign a Card. The words �our�, �we� and �us� mean FAIRWINDS Credit Union or any of its assignees. Unless otherwise stated �account� means your VISA� Credit Card Line of Credit with us.

1. We agree to extend credit to you and advance amounts up to your credit limit. We will notify you of your maximum credit limit. Upon receipt of your Card, you will immediately sign the back of the Card to ensure proper use. You agree to pay us for credit extended pursuant to the use of the Card by you or any other cardholders together with all applicable finance charges, and in accordance with the terms of this agreement. You agree by signing, using or permitting others to use the Card to the terms and conditions contained in this agreement, on the Card, or any charge slip resulting from authorized use of the Card and on any authorized cash advance slip.

2. We will have no liability or responsibility if any merchant refuses to honor the Card. No cash refund will be made to you with respect to any adjustment for goods or services purchased. All adjustments will be made by credit to your account by an executed credit voucher issued by the appropriate merchant.

3. You agree to use the Card only within the credit limit authorized by us. You also agree that we can change your credit limit at any time. Any extension of credit to you, made or honored by us, shall be at such times, in such amounts and for such purposes as shall conform to this agreement and only in the event there does not exist any default. We are not obligated to accept charges which would cause you to exceed your credit limit.

4. You agree to advise us of any change in your financial condition which may affect your creditworthiness and to provide us with a current loan application whenever we request one.

5. You agree to make a good-faith effort to resolve any billing error dispute.

6. You agree to pay all charges (purchases, balance transfers and cash advances) on your account made by you or anyone who you authorize to use your account. Your obligation to pay the amount owed on your account continues until paid in full even though an agreement, divorce decree, or other court judgment to which we are not a party may direct someone else to pay the account balance. If more than one person is subject to this agreement, each is individually responsible for all amounts owed. This means we can enforce this agreement against any of you individually or all of you together.

7. You also agree that we can change the terms of this agreement at any time, as long as we give you written notice as required by law before the change becomes effective. Use of your account on or after the effective date of any change will constitute your acceptance of the new terms. Any changes to the agreement may apply to all outstanding indebtedness. This includes any indebtedness which shall have arisen out of purchases, balance transfers and cash advances made by you on the effective date of the changes.

8. We may disclose information about your account in order to advise third parties, such as credit bureaus or merchants, of the existence or condition of your account, or if you give us written permission, or in order to comply with a government agency of court orders.

9. You will be in default if your payment is 3 or more days late or you break one of your promises under this agreement. If you are in default, we can declare the entire balance of your account due at once, without notice. We can do this if you make any false or misleading statements on any request for an advance. If collection is necessary, you agree to pay all the costs of collection including reasonable attorney�s fee and court costs.

10. THE CARD. Upon receipt of the Card(s) you and all other cardholders will sign the signature panel on the back of the Card(s). The Card remains our property and may be revoked by us without notice at any time. The Card must be surrendered to us (or our agent designated to repossess it) upon demand or revocation. If we employ an agent for such repossession, your account will be charged with any related fee. You will remain responsible to pay the amount you owe us according to the terms of this agreement. If this account is jointly held, either of the joint cardholders may terminate the account at anytime by returning all Cards issued under this agreement to us. Such action will not relieve either of the joint cardholders or any other cardholder from liability for repayment of any obligations arising from the use of the account.

11. ISSUANCE AND USE OF CONVENIENCE CHECKS. If we issue you convenience checks, they are processed as cash advances and accumulate finance charges from the date the check posts to your account. Convenience Checks may only be used by the person whose name is printed on them. We may refuse to issue or reissue, and may also terminate, limit, or modify the use of, the checks without notice to you, and you agree to surrender the checks upon our demand or upon learning of our cancellation or withdrawal of the checks. All the terms and conditions of this agreement apply to the checks and balance transfers. Only checks, balance transfers and other methods authorized by us now and into the future may be used to obtain funds from this account, and if so authorized by us, your use of a personal identification number (PIN) for such purposes shall constitute your signature. Paid convenience checks and balance transfer checks become our property and will not be returned to you. Copies may be provided, if requested, for a nominal fee per item. Should we decline to pay any convenience check or balance transfer, we shall not be liable for any action we take regarding payment or nonpayment of a convenience check or balance transfer. You will not date any check later than the date you write it. If you do and the check is presented for payment before its date, we may return it unpaid.

12. ANNUAL FEE. There is no annual fee at this time. You will receive prior written notice should we decide to impose an annual fee.

13. PAYMENTS. A payment is due each month. Your payments must be mailed to the address indicated on the monthly statement. All payments will be credited to your account promptly, in most cases as of the day of receipt and in no case more than 5 business days from the date of receipt. Your Card account (16-digit) number should always be written on the bottom left hand corner of your check or money order. You understand and agree that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, payments will be applied in the following order (1) finance charge, (2) annual, late, overlimit or NSF fee (if applicable), (3) previous transfer balances (4) previous balance cash advances, (5) previous balance purchases, (6) new transfer balances (7) new cash advances, (8) new purchases. All payments made to your account must be in US dollars and drawn on a US bank. You agree that purchases and cash advances made on foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed to you in US dollars. Your minimum payment due is the greater of $20 or 2% of the �new balance� plus the �past due� amount, and/or all amounts in excess of the authorized credit line/limit shown on the periodic statement. If the new balance does not exceed $20, only the �new balance� is due and is shown as the �minimum payment due�. All �past due� or �overlimit� amounts are due and must be fully paid immediately upon notification. You may pay the total amount due, which is shown as the new balance, or you may pay any additional amount you wish over the �minimum payment due�.

14. LATE CHARGES: If you do not make the minimum payment due by the 3rd day after the due date, there will be a late charge of $25, in the case of the first violation, or $35, in the case of any additional violation during any six consecutive billing cycles; provided, however, the late charge shall in no case exceed the amount of the required minimum payment due. Any late payment charge you owe us will be added to your account but will not be included in any finance charge calculation.

15. RETURN PAYMENT: If a payment is returned, there will be a return payment charge of $25, in the case of the first violation, or $30, in the case of any additional violation during any six consecutive billing cycles; provided, however, the return payment charge shall in no case exceed the amount of the required minimum payment due. Any return payment charge you owe us will be added to your account but will not be included in any finance charge calculation.

16. CASH ADVANCE WITHDRAWALS LIMITS: ATM cash advance withdrawals shall be limited to $505 daily, and cash advances made at any financial institution branch shall be limited to $1,500.

17. CASH ADVANCE FEES: For each cash advance, a fee of 4% will be charged. The minimum cash advance fee is $10. Cash advance transactions are defined as ATM withdrawals, Convenience Checks, and cash advances made at any financial institution branch.

18. BALANCE TRANSFER FEES: For each balance transfer, a fee of 3% will be charged. The minimum balance transfer fee is $5. 

19. FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE (INTEREST) for purchases and balance transfers will equal the sum of the Prime Rate as listed in the Money Rates Section of Eastern edition of the Wall Street Journal on the last business day of each month plus a margin based upon your cumulative credit history. Your margin, initial monthly Periodic Rate and corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) for purchases and balance transfers are as set forth in the Account Opening Disclosures provided to you at the time of the delivery of this agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. The FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and balance transfers will be subject to a maximum of the lesser of 18.00% APR or the highest APR then permitted by applicable law. The FINANCE CHARGE (INTEREST) for cash advances will equal the sum of the Prime Rate plus 17.99%, subject to a maximum of the lesser of 18.00% APR or the highest APR then permitted by applicable law. If the index is discontinued or is no longer available, a successor index setting forth the prime rate will be chosen by us.  To avoid incurring an additional FINANCE CHARGE on purchases and balance transfers reflected on your periodic statement and on any new purchases and balance transfers appearing on your next statement, you must pay the new balance for purchases and balance transfers shown on the periodic statement on or before the Payment Due Date. The FINANCE CHARGES for a billing cycle are computed by applying the monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of  (i) purchases and balance transfers, or (ii) cash advances, as the case may be, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Separate average daily balances are calculated for (i) purchases and balance transfers, and (ii) cash advances. Each daily balance of (i) purchases and balance transfers, or (ii) cash advances, as the case may be, is determined by adding to the previous balance of (i) purchases and balance transfers, or (ii) cash advances, as the case may be, any new (i) purchases and balance transfers, or (ii) cash advances, as the case may be, posted to your account and subtracting any payments as received and credits posted to your account and applied to (i) purchases and balance transfers, or (ii) cash advances, as the case may be, but excluding any unpaid FINANCE CHARGES. FINANCE CHARGES will begin to accrue on Cash Advances, including Bank Cash Advances, Convenience Checks, and ATMs from the date of the transaction. Fees are not included in the calculation of the average daily balance. Finance charges will continue to accrue on your account until what you owe under this agreement is paid in full.

20. VARIABLE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR): The Variable ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances will be based on the Prime Rate as published in the Money Rates Section of the Eastern edition of The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of each month and your cumulative credit history. Changes in the Prime Rate will cause changes in the APR. Changes in the APR as the result of changes in the Prime Rate will be effective on the first day of the next month following one full billing cycle after any change in the Prime Rate. If the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE increases or decreases, the FINANCE CHARGE will increase or decrease. Any increase in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and its corresponding monthly periodic rate and daily periodic rate will result in more finance charges and higher minimum periodic payments. Each change in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and Monthly Periodic Rate will apply to any balance outstanding on the effective date of such change as well as to future credit purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. The APR will not increase above the lesser of the maximum rate allowed by law or 18.00%.

21. CASH ADVANCE APR. Cash Advance ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will be the Prime Rate plus 17.99% for all bank cash advances, ATM cash advances, and convenience checks.

22. ASSIGNMENT OF ACCOUNT. You agree that we may at any time sell, transfer or assign your account to another financial institution.

23. LOST OR STOLEN CARD. You are responsible for the possession and use of the Card and must maintain the confidentiality of the PIN we may assign you. You will notify us if you believe your Card has been lost, stolen or if you have reason to believe that the Card is being used without your permission immediately. You may notify security by calling 1.800.449.7728 seven (7) days a week twenty-four (24) hours a day.

24. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE. You are liable for all authorized use of any Card issued under this agreement regardless of the credit limit or the party using it. You also may be liable for the unauthorized use of your Card as follows: 1) If you tell us after learning of the loss or theft of the card, your liability for unauthorized transactions using the VISA system is Zero; 2) For card transactions through a non-VISA network, VISA Commercial Cards, VISA or Plus ATM, or any ATM transactions, or to cards issued outside the United States, if you tell us within two (2) business days after learning of the loss or theft of the Card, your liability for unauthorized transactions is $50.00; 3) For ATM transactions, your liability for unauthorized transactions is $500.00 if you do not tell us within two (2) business days; and 4) if you do not tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was mailed, you may not get any money you lost if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had you told us in time. The term �unauthorized� does not include any transaction from which you receive a benefit or any transaction by a person with actual, implied, or apparent authority to use the Card. We may require you to provide a written statement regarding claims of unauthorized transactions. If we determine that you have been grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handing of your account or Card, your liability may increase. These rules do not apply to other electronic transfers. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us orally at 1.800.449.7728, or in writing to Customer Service, P.O. Box 31112, Tampa, FL 33631-3112. You agree to cooperate with us in the recovery of any amounts advanced based on such unauthorized use.

25. STATEMENTS AND NOTICES. We will bill you monthly, on a date selected by us, for amounts due under this agreement. Upon receipt of each periodic statement you should examine it and immediately notify us in writing of any transaction you believe to be in error to Customer Service, P.O. Box 31112, Tampa, FL 33631-3112. Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the most recent address you have given us. You agree to notify us promptly of any change in your name, address and phone number. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all of you.

26. SECURITY INTEREST. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares for this account, your pledged shares will secure your charge account. You pledge as security for the charge account all shares and dividends and, if any, all deposits and interest in all joint and individual accounts you have with us now or in the future. Also, any property you give as security will secure all amounts owed under this agreement and all other loans you have with us now or in the future, except any loan secured by your principle dwelling. Your pledge does not apply to any Individual Retirement Account or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. Property securing other loans you have with us may also secure this agreement.

27. MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENT. You must be and remain a Member in good standing with us to be eligible for continuing Account and/or Card privileges including future purchases and advances. We may suspend the Account and/or Card privileges, including closing the Account, if you do not maintain your Membership with us.

28. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS: Purchases, Cash Advances, and credits made in foreign currencies will be billed to your Account in U.S. dollars. The conversion to U.S. dollars will be made in accordance with the Visa� operating regulations for international transactions. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa� from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable Central Processing Date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa� itself receives, or the government- mandated rate in effect for the applicable Central Processing Date in each instance, plus a two percent (2%) foreign transaction fee. This fee will also apply to foreign transactions which do not require a conversion to US dollars. The conversion rate may be different than the rate on the day of the transaction or date of posting of the Account. When a credit to the Account does not fully offset a charge to the Account due to changes in the rate, you are responsible for the difference.

29. ILLEGAL USE. You may use your FAIRWINDS Credit Union credit Card for any transaction permitted by law. You may not use your Card for any gambling purposes, either legal or illegal. You agree that illegal use and/or use in gambling activities of this Card will be deemed an action of default and/or breach of contract and such service and/or other related services may be terminated at our discretion. You further agree, should illegal use occur, to waive the right to sue us for such illegal activity directly or indirectly related to it. You also agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any suits or other legal action or liability, directly or indirectly, resulting from such use.

30. OTHER AGREEMENTS. All the terms and conditions of any other agreement between us and you and/or any other institution that is part of a network of automated teller machines (ATM) in which we participate, and any applicable rules and regulations, also apply to use of the Card. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this agreement and the terms of other agreement or sales, cash advance, credit or other slips you sign or receive, the terms of this agreement shall govern. There may be minimum and/or maximum limits on the amount of a cash advance dispensed from electrical terminals which accept the Card. All of the transactions made by electronic means are subject to verification by us. You agree that we do not waive our rights under this agreement if we fail to assert them. The agreement binds and benefits us and our successors and assigns and binds you, your estate and your personal representatives. 

31.  INVALIDITY OF PROVISIONS AND CAPTIONS. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid the rest of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.  The paragraph headings are for convenience only and do not form a part of this Agreement.

32.  GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE.  The terms and conditions of this Agreement are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida and any applicable Federal law. The venue for any legal action or claim you make against the Credit Union will be Orange County, Florida.

What to do if you find a mistake on your statement

If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at: 
	
	Customer Service
	P.O. Box 31112
	Tampa, FL 33631-3112

You may also contact us on the web: www.fairwinds.org
In your letter, give us the following information:

* Account information:  Your name and account number
* Dollar amount:  The dollar amount of the suspected error
* Description of problem:  If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.

You must contact us:

* Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
* At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter

When we receive your letter, we must do two things:

1.	Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2. 	Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
       
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:

* We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
* The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
* While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
* We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:

1. If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
2. If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.

If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.

To use this right, all of the following must be true:

1. 	The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50.  (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. 	You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3.	You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing or electronically at:
	
	Customer Service
	P.O. Box 31112
	Tampa, FL 33631-
	www.fairwinds.org

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called �daily balance�. 

During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying 
the periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following 
balance types, as applicable: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or 
special promotions. 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees 
posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type.

GE MONEY BANK 
CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT 


1. CONTRACT. This Agreement (�Agreement�) is a contract for the extension of credit. It controls your credit card account referenced on the document received with your credit card or 
on your welcome letter. This Agreement includes this document and the following documents: 
� The application or any other document you submitted to us in connection with the account; and 
� The privacy policy that is enclosed with or attached to this document. 
By opening or using your account, you agree to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement starts when (i) you give us an account application we approve or (ii) you use your account or 
let someone else use it, whichever occurs first. 

2. PARTIES. The parties to this Agreement are you and GE Money Bank. GE Money Bank is located at 170 West Election Road, Suite 125, Draper, Utah 84020. GE Money Bank 
sometimes is called �us,� �we� or �our� in this Agreement. 

3. PROMISE TO PAY. You promise to pay us for all credit that we extend on your account, including credit extended when you let another person use your account. You also promise to 
pay us for all other amounts owed to us under this Agreement. 

4. CHANGING TERMS. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may change, add to or delete any of the terms of this Agreement, including the interest rates, 
fees and charges. 

5. GOVERNING LAW. Except as provided in the Dispute and Claim Resolution (Including Arbitration) provision, this Agreement and your account are governed by federal 
law and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of Utah without regard to its conflicts of law principles. This Agreement has been accepted by us in Utah. 

6. CREDIT CARD. We have issued or will send you a credit card for your use. You are not permitted to allow anyone else to use your credit card, but if you do, you will be responsible 
for such use. You will destroy all the credit card(s) issued on your account if we ask you to do so. 

7. AUTHORIZED USER/JOINT ACCOUNT. If you ask us to send a credit card to another person that you want to let use your account, you will be responsible for all transactions made 
by that person. That person will be considered an authorized user. If another person is approved on the account, that person will be considered a joint accountholder. Each joint 
accountholder may use the account and agrees to the terms of this Agreement. No matter which joint accountholder uses the account, each of you must pay back the full amount owed 
on the account. We may treat each of you as one accountholder. For example, giving notice to one of you is considered the same as giving notice to both of you. Also, we may follow the 
instructions that we get from one of you even if they differ from instructions given by the other accountholder. 

8. USING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may use your account only as stated in this Agreement. You may use your account for the following: 
� Purchases. You may buy goods or services; 
� Cash Advances. If applicable, you may get cash advances by writing convenience checks we may provide to you from time to time or by other means we may make available. We 
may not honor a convenience check (i) if you filed for bankruptcy, (ii) if the check is expired, (iii) if your account is closed, (iv) if the amount of the check would exceed your available 
credit or cash advance limit, or (v) as otherwise stated on your convenience check; and 
� Balance Transfers. If applicable, from time to time, we may offer you the chance to transfer balances from your other credit card accounts to this account. Unless we tell you 
otherwise, we will treat balance transfers as purchases. We reserve the right to decline to process any balance transfer request for any reason, and will not transfer a balance from 
any of our affiliates. Transfers will be processed in the order determined by us. If the amount you wish to transfer is greater than your available credit limit, we may reject the 
request(s). It may take up to four weeks for a balance transfer request to be credited to your other credit card account(s). It is your responsibility to make any payments required to 
keep your other account(s) current and to close your other account(s), if you desire. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur on your other account(s) as a result of 
your balance transfer(s). If you have a dispute with a creditor, and pay the balance in question by transferring it to your account, you may lose certain dispute rights. 

You may use your account only for lawful personal, family or household purposes. You may not use your account for internet gambling or illegal purposes. You may not use your account 
to pay amounts you owe us on this account or on other accounts you have with us. These restrictions are for our benefit, and we are not responsible to you for enforcing them. 

9. CREDIT AND CASH ADVANCE LIMITS. 
A. Assigning Limits. We will assign the following limit(s) on your account, as applicable. We may increase or decrease either or both of these limits at any time. 
Credit Limit � This is the highest amount of total credit we will extend to you on your account. 

Cash Advance Limit � This is the highest amount of credit we will extend to you for cash advances made on your account, if applicable. Cash transactions will also count 
towards your credit limit. 

B. Exceeding Limits. We may refuse to authorize you to use your account if that use (including any fees associated with that use) will cause the total you will owe on your account to 
be more than your credit limit. If applicable, you may not get a cash advance if that cash advance (including interest and cash advance fees) will cause the total you will owe for 
cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit. If we approve a transaction that causes the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit 
limit or, if applicable, the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit, we do not give up any of our rights under this Agreement 
and we do not treat it as an increase in your credit limit or, if applicable, cash advance limit. 

C. Limiting Transactions. We reserve the right to not approve transactions on your account. To prevent fraud, we may also limit the number or dollar amount of transactions you can 
make in a particular amount of time. 

10. INTEREST. This section explains (i) the interest rates that will apply to your account, (ii) when interest will be charged on your account, and (iii) how the amount of interest is calculated. 
A. Rates. The following rates apply to purchases and, if applicable, cash advances. A higher rate, which we call a �Penalty APR� may apply at certain times as described below. The 
Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account are shown in the table above and will also be shown on your billing statement. 
We calculate interest on the balance of your account each day. We use a daily rate to calculate the interest each day. The daily rate is equal to the APR divided by 365. 

1. Purchase Rate. The daily rate for purchases is .06572% (APR 23.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
2. Cash Advance Rate. The daily rate for cash advances is .08216% (APR 29.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
3. Penalty Rate. The penalty rate may apply if you do not make your total minimum payment by the payment due date and will continue to apply as provided in this section. As 
required by law, we will provide you with advance notice if we are going to apply the penalty rate to your account and we will tell you when the penalty rate will apply. 
a. What is the Penalty Rate? The daily penalty rate will be .08216% (APR 29.99%). 
b. How Long Will the Penalty Rate Apply? If you are not more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to transactions made on your account after a date 
specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make all required payments by the payment due date for six consecutive billing periods, your rate will return to the 
standard APR; otherwise, the penalty rate will apply indefinitely. 

If you are or become more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to all balances and new transactions on your account not already subject to the penalty 
rate as specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make six consecutive minimum payments by the payment due date, starting with your first payment due 
date after the date specified in the advance notice, your rate for any balances created on your account prior to or within 14 days after the date of the advance notice 
that are not already subject to (or scheduled under a prior notice to be subject to) the penalty rate will return to the standard APR. If you do not make these six consecutive 
minimum payments, we may apply the penalty rate to all balances on your account indefinitely. 

B. When We Charge Interest. 
1. Purchases. We charge interest on your purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full, except as set forth below: 
� We will not charge you interest during a billing cycle on any purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the billing cycle or (ii) you had such a balance, you paid 
that balance in full by the due date in that billing cycle. 
� We will credit, as of the beginning of the billing cycle, any payment you make by the due date that we allocate to purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the 
previous billing cycle, or (ii) if you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in the previous billing cycle. 

2. Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. If applicable, we charge interest on your balance transfers and cash advances (and their related fees) from the date you make the 
transaction until you pay them in full. You cannot avoid paying interest on balance transfers or cash advances or on their fees. 

C. How We Calculate Interest. During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the 
periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types, as applicable: 
purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 
� 
First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract 
any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. We charge a minimum of $2 of 
interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest. 

11. FEES. We may charge some or all of the following fees. The table at the beginning of this Agreement shows the amount of each of the maintenance, transaction and penalty fees. 
A. A monthly Maintenance Fee each month your account is open and has a balance greater than zero. 
B. Transaction Fees. 
1. A Balance Transfer Fee for each balance transfer you make. 
2. A Cash Advance Fee for each cash advance you get. 
3. A Promotional Fee related to certain special promotions. For fixed payment promotions, the promotional fee will not be added to the purchase balance for calculation of 
the total minimum payment due; the fee must be paid as part of the promotional balance. The fee will be included in the purchase balance for all other promotions and must 
be paid as part of promotional balance. 

C. Penalty Fees. 
1. A Late Payment Fee if we do not receive at least the total minimum payment due on your account by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the due date shown on your statement. The amount 
of the late payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if you have paid at least your total minimum payment due by the payment due date in each of the prior six billing cycles or 
(2) $35 if you have failed to pay at least the total minimum payment due by the payment due date in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the late 
payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for which the late payment fee is assessed, the amount of the late payment fee will instead be equal to the 
amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 
2. A Returned Payment Fee if any check or other instrument sent to us, or any electronic payment authorization you provide us in payment on your account, is not honored 
upon first presentment, even if the check, instrument or electronic authorization is later honored. The amount of the returned payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if 
your payments have been honored upon first presentment in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any payment has been dishonored upon first presentment in any 
one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the returned payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for the cycle in which the payment was dishonored 
upon first presentment, the amount of the returned payment fee will instead be equal to the amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

D. Other Fees. 
1. A Returned Convenience Check Fee of up to $35 if we do not honor a convenience check because (i) it will cause you to go over your cash advance limit, (ii) you filed a 
petition in bankruptcy, (iii) the check is expired, or (iv) your account is closed. The amount of the returned convenience check fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if your convenience 
checks have been honored in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any convenience check has been dishonored in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. 
However, if the returned convenience check fee would exceed the amount of the dishonored convenience check, the amount of the returned convenience check fee will 
instead be equal to the amount of the dishonored convenience check. 
2. A Stop Payment Fee of $39.99 if we stop payment on any convenience check at your request. 

12. YOUR PAYMENTS. 
A. Required Payment and Crediting of Payment. Each billing cycle you must pay at least the total minimum payment by 5:00 pm (ET) on the payment due 
date. You may at any time pay more than the total minimum payment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payment may reduce the 
amount of interest you will pay. Any payments received after 5:00 pm (ET) will be credited as of the next day. We may delay making credit available 
on your account in the amount of your payment. 

B. Minimum Payment. Your total minimum payment is the greatest of (a) $35, (b) 2.5% of your highest New Balance for the life of your account, or (c) 
the interest and late payment fees billed on your statement plus $20. As used in this paragraph, �new balance� excludes any balance attributable to 
any special promotion that involves delayed or special payments. We round up to the next highest whole dollar in figuring your total minimum 
payment. If your new balance on your billing statement is less than $35, then your total minimum payment will be equal to the new balance. 

C. How to Make a Payment. To make a payment you must follow all the instructions below and the instructions on your billing statement. If you do not follow these instructions, credit 
of your payment to your account may be delayed up to five days. 
1. Do the following: (a) make your payment in United States dollars by check, money order, or similar instrument from a bank located in the U.S; (b) send the payment coupon 
from your billing statement with your payment; (c) send the payment and payment coupon in the envelope provided with your billing statement to the payment address listed on 
your billing statement; and (d) send only one payment and one payment coupon in each envelope. Alternatively you may make your payment online at the website address 
shown on your billing statement provided you make your payment in United States dollars from a bank located in the U.S. 
2. Do not do the following: (a) staple, paper clip, tape or fold your payment or payment coupon; (b) include any other papers or items with your payment; (c) use a balance 
transfer or convenience check from your account to pay us; or (d) send us cash. 

D. Other Ways to Make a Payment. Certain participating stores or providers may take payments that you make to them as a convenience to you. We may not credit those payments 
to your account until we receive them. We may allow you to make payments over the phone as an accommodation to you, but we may charge you a fee to do so. 

E. Disputed Amounts. If you send us correspondence about a disputed amount, you must send it to the address for billing inquiries shown on your billing statement. 
You may not send it to the payment address shown on your billing statement. By �disputed amount,� we mean a payment of less than the full balance on your account 
that is labeled as �payment in full� or similar language, or is given to us as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, or is given to us with other conditions or limitations. 
We may accept these types of payments without giving up any of our rights. 

F. Authorization. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or 
to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon 
as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. 

G. Payment Allocation. We reserve the right to select the method by which the required minimum payment is allocated to different balances on your account. Some or all of the 
required minimum payment on your account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. The payment allocation method that we use may result in higher 
interest on your account or reduced savings attributable to any special promotions. Any payment you make in excess of the required minimum payment will be allocated to 
balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs, unless applicable law requires or permits otherwise (such as when your account has a certain type of special 
promotion). 

13. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS. At times, we may offer you special promotions when you use your account for certain transactions. These special promotions will have some terms that 
are different from the terms in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement apply to any special promotion, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the special promotion. We 
may terminate your participation in any special promotion and/or apply the penalty rate to your account balances (including special promotion balances) if you become more than 60 days 
late on any payment due on your account. If this happens, each special promotion balance will no longer be subject to the terms of the special promotion and will instead be subject to the 
terms of this Agreement. A promotional charge may be charged as part of a special promotion. Please see any special promotion advertising (including in-store signs) or other disclosures 
provided to you for the full terms of any special promotion offered. 

14. SECURITY INTEREST. You grant us a purchase money security interest in each item of merchandise purchased on your account to secure its unpaid purchase price until such 
merchandise is paid in full. Solely for the purpose of determining the extent of our purchase money security interest in each such item of merchandise, your payments will be allocated 
first to interest on the account, and then to pay off each purchase on the account in the order in which the purchase was made (if more than one item was purchased on the same day, 
your payments will be allocated to pay off the lowest priced item first). If you made a purchase pursuant to a credit promotion, the balance with respect to the promotional purchase may 
be shown on statements during the promotional period and may reflect a different payment allocation method. In no event will we assert a security interest in the promotional purchase for 
an amount greater than the lowest balance shown on a statement for that promotional purchase. We agree that no security interest is or will be retained or acquired under this agreement 
in any real property which is used or is expected to be used as your dwelling. Should we feel it necessary, you authorize us to sign and file financing statements regarding any vehicle 
purchased. 

For some individual purchases under your account, we may require you to maintain property/casualty insurance on the purchase as a condition of granting you credit. You will be 
informed of any property/casualty insurance requirement at the time you make the purchase. 

15. UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should call us immediately at 1-800-250-5411. 
You will not be liable for any unauthorized use on your account. 

You agree that unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given your card or allowed use of your account. You will be responsible for all use by such a 
person. 

16. YOUR CREDIT REPORTS AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION. 
A. Using and Sharing Your Information. When you applied for an account you gave us information about yourself. You also agreed that we could ask others for information about 
your creditworthiness and that we could ask consumer reporting agencies for your consumer report. We use this information in considering your application. We also use this 
information for any updates, renewals or extensions of credit on your account. We use this information to review and collect your account. We use this information to provide you 
with offers. We may give information about you or your account to consumer reporting agencies and other proper parties. This information may include your performance under this 
Agreement. 

B. Inaccurate Information. Tell us if you think we reported wrong information about you to a consumer reporting agency (also called a credit bureau). Write to us at P.O. 
Box 981439, El Paso, TX 79998-1439. In your written communication, tell us what information is wrong and why you think it is wrong. If you have a copy of the credit 
report that includes the wrong information, send a copy of it with your written communication. We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late 
payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. 

17. USE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOUR ACCOUNT. We will give information about you and your account to dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals 
that accept this credit card (and their affiliates) and you consent to this. Dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals will use the information in connection with the credit 
card program and for things like creating and updating their records and offering you special benefits. We will use information about you and your account as set forth in the privacy policy 
that is attached to or enclosed with this document. 

18. CHANGE OF ADDRESS/PHONE NUMBER. You agree to tell us right away if you change your address or phone number(s). We will contact you at the address in our records until 
we are able to update our records with your new address. 

19. CONSENT TO COMMUNICATIONS. You consent to us contacting you using all channels of communication and for all purposes (including collection purposes), using all contact 
information you provide to us. You also consent to us and any other owner or servicer of your account contacting you about your account, including using text messages, any automatic 
telephone dialing system and/or an artificial or prerecorded voice when contacting you, even if you are charged for the call under your phone plan. You are responsible for any charges for 
contacting you that may be billed to you by your communications carriers. 

20. TELEPHONE MONITORING. For quality control purposes, you permit us to listen to or record telephone calls between you and us. 

21. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. 
A. When You May Close Your Account. 
You may close your account at any time by writing or calling us and asking us to close your account. You must send this writing to the 
address shown on your billing statement or call us at the customer service number shown on your billing statement. We will close your account after we get your request. 

B. When We May Close Your Account. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may close your account at any time and for any reason. 

C. After You or We Close Your Account. 
If you or we close your account, you must stop using it. You will still have to pay us the full amount you owe on your account. This 
Agreement controls your account until you pay it in full. 

22. DEFAULT. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, you are in default if you: 
� Make a late payment; 
� Do not follow any other term of this Agreement; or 
� Become bankrupt or insolvent. 
If you default or upon your death, we may, subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law: (i) make the full amount owing on your account due right away; (ii) bring a legal 
action to collect all amounts owed; and/or (iii) take any action allowed by law. We may also reduce your credit limit or close your account at any time whether or not you are in default. 

23. COLLECTION COSTS. If we ask an attorney to collect your account, we may charge you our collection costs. Collection costs may include court costs, reasonable attorneys� fees 
and fees for repossession, repair, storage and sale of any vehicle securing a purchase. We will charge these costs only if the attorney we ask to collect is not our salaried employee and 
the law allows us to do so. 

24. DISPUTE AND CLAIM RESOLUTION (INCLUDING ARBITRATION) PROVISION. 
General /Requirement to Arbitrate. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION 
WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A 
COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS 
INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED. This Provision replaces any existing arbitration provision with us and will stay in force no matter 
what happens to your account, including termination. 

Upon demand, and except as otherwise provided below, you and we must arbitrate individually any dispute or claim between you, any joint cardholder and/or any additional cardholder, 
on the one hand; and us, our affiliates, agents and/or dealers/merchants/retailers or participating professionals, on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises from or relates to your 
account. However, we will not require you to arbitrate: (1) any individual case in small claims court or your state�s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court; or 
(2) any claim by us that only involves our effort to collect money you owe us. However, if you respond to a collection lawsuit by claiming that we engaged in any wrongdoing, we may 
require you to arbitrate. 

YOU AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. ALSO, YOU 
MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ON BEHALF OF ANY CARDHOLDER WHO IS NOT A JOINT OR ADDITIONAL CARDHOLDER WITH YOU ON YOUR ACCOUNT (AN 
�UNRELATED CARDHOLDER�), AND YOU AGREE THAT NO UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY BRING ANY CLAIMS AGAINST US ON YOUR BEHALF. CLAIMS BY YOU AND 
BY AN UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY NOT BE JOINED IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. Only a court may decide whether any part of this paragraph is enforceable. If it is finally 
determined that this paragraph is not fully enforceable, only this sentence of the Provision will remain in force and the remainder of the Provision will be null and void, provided that the 
court�s determination concerning the enforceability of this paragraph shall be subject to appeal. 

Starting an Arbitration. If you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, the electing party must notify the other party in writing. This notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit and can be 
given in papers filed in the lawsuit. Otherwise, your notice must b",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT
In this Agreement, �You� and �your� mean any person who accepts this Agreement or uses the Card. The �Card� means any credit card issued to you or those designated by you under the terms of this Agreement. �We�, �us�, �our� and the �Credit Union� means Commonwealth Credit Union or its successors.


SECURITY: YOU SPECIFICALLY GRANT US A CONSENSUAL SECURITY INTEREST IN ALL INDIVIDUAL AND JOINT ACCOUNTS YOU HAVE WITH US NOW AND IN THE FUTURE TO SECURE REPAYMENT OF CREDIT EXTENDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. YOU ALSO AGREE THAT WE HAVE SIMILAR STATUTORY LIEN RIGHTS UNDER STATE AND/OR FEDERAL LAW. THE GRANTING OF THIS SECURITY INTEREST IS A CONDITION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF CREDIT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE IN DEFAULT, WE CAN APPLY YOUR SHARES TO THE AMOUNT YOU OWE. Shares and deposits in an Individual Retirement Account or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given are not subject to this security interest.
If you have other loans with us, collateral securing such loans may also secure your obligations under this Agreement, unless that other collateral is your principal residence or non-purchase money household goods.
Using Your Card. You can purchase or lease goods and services from any merchant who honors your Card, and you may obtain cash advances from financial institutions and ATM machines that accept the Card, up to your maximum credit limit. You agree not to present your Card or obtain a cash advance for any extension of credit in excess of your available credit limit; however, if you do exceed your credit limit, you agree to make immediate payment sufficient to bring the balance below the credit limit. Certain purchases and cash advances require authorization prior to completion of the transaction. In some cases, you may be asked to provide identification. If our system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even though you have sufficient credit available. Also, for security reasons, we may block the use of your Card in certain countries or geographic areas. We will have no liability to you or others if any of these events occur. 
Personal Identification Number (PIN). We may issue a Personal Identification Number (PIN) for use with your Card. This PIN is confidential and should not be disclosed to anyone. You may use your PIN and your Card to access your account, and all sums advanced will be added to your account balance. In the event a use of your PIN constitutes an Electronic Funds Transfer, the terms and conditions of your Electronic Funds Transfer Agreement may affect your rights. 
Promise To Pay. You promise to pay us in U.S. dollars for (a) all purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers made by you or anyone whom you authorize to use the Card; (b) all Interest Charges and all other charges or fees; (c) collection costs and attorney's fees as permitted by applicable law, and any costs incurred in the recovery of the Card; and (d) credit in excess of your credit limit that we may extend to you.  
Illegal Transactions: You agree that your Card and account will not be used to make or facilitate any illegal transactions as determined by applicable law; and that any such use will constitute an event of default under this Agreement. We may decline any transaction that we believe to be illegal under applicable law, including but not limited to any transaction involving or relating to any gambling activity. You agree that we will have no liability or responsibility for any such use by you or any authorized user(s); or for declining any such transaction. You further agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any suits, liability, damages or adverse action of any kind that results directly or indirectly from such illegal use. You promise to pay us any and all amounts owing on your Card for any transactions made by you, even if the transaction is determined to be illegal. 
Joint Accounts. Each of you will be responsible, jointly and severally, for the repayment of amounts owed, regardless of who initiated any transaction under the account. 
Others Using Your Account. If you allow anyone else to use your account, you will be liable for all credit extended to such persons. You promise to pay for all purchases and advances made by anyone you authorize to use your account, whether or not you notify us that he or she will be using it. If someone else is authorized to use your account and you want to end that person's privilege, you must notify us in writing, and if he or she has a Card, you must return that Card with your written notice for it to be effective.  
Ownership of Card. Your Card remains our property and may be cancelled by us at any time without notice. You agree to surrender your Card and to discontinue use of the account immediately upon our request.
Interest Charges. Average Daily Balance including new transactions: Interest Charges will accrue on your average daily balance outstanding during the month. To get the average daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new purchases, cash advances, balance transfers or other advances, and subtract any payments, unpaid interest charges, and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide that by the number of days in the billing cycle. We then multiply that by the periodic rate corresponding to the Annual Percentage Rate on your account. If you have different rates for purchases, cash advances or balance transfers, separate average daily balances for each will be calculated and the appropriate periodic rate is then applied to each.
Grace Period on Purchases Only: You can avoid Interest Charges on purchases by paying the full amount of the new balance for purchases each month by the date on which the payment is due. Otherwise, the new balance of your account, and subsequent advances from the date they are posted to the account, will be subject to an Interest Charge. You cannot avoid Interest Charges on cash advances; even if you pay the entire cash advance balance by the payment due date, you will incur the Interest Charges accrued from the date the cash advance is posted to your account. 
Fees. In addition to the Interest Charges set forth above, you agree to also pay any and all fees that you incur as disclosed to you on your Truth-in-Lending Statement or similar disclosures (as may be amended from time to time), or as disclosed to you during the term of your Card. 
If Your Card is Lost or Stolen or if an Unauthorized Use Occurs. You agree to notify us immediately if your Card is ever lost or stolen or if an unauthorized use may have occurred. ""Unauthorized use"" means the use of the Card by someone other than you who does not have actual, implied or apparent authority for such use, and from which you receive no benefit. The telephone number to call is (502) 564-4775 or (800) 228-6420. You agree to follow up your call with notice in writing to us at: P.O. Box 978, Frankfort, KY 40602-0978. You also agree to assist us in determining the facts, circumstances and other pertinent information relating to any loss, theft or possible unauthorized use of your Card and comply with such procedures as we may require in connection with our investigation. You will be liable for any unauthorized use only if we can prove that you were grossly negligent in your use or handling of your Card, or if we can prove that you used your Card fraudulently.
Minimum Payment Due; Crediting of Payments. Payments are due in the amount and on the date disclosed on your billing statement. If your payment is received by us on a business day at the address and by the time designated on the billing statement, it will be credited to your account on the date of receipt. If payment is made at any location other than the address designated on the periodic statement, credit for such payment may be delayed up to five (5) days. Payments will be applied in any order we determine, subject to applicable law. 



Default; Acceleration; Credit Suspension; Collection Costs. You will be in default if: (1) you fail to make any payment on time; (2) if you fail to keep any promises you have made under this Agreement or under other Agreements you have with us; (3) if you die; (4) if you file a petition in bankruptcy or have a bankruptcy petition filed against you, or if you become involved in any insolvency, receivership or custodial proceeding; (5) if anyone attempts to take any of your funds held by us via legal process or if you have a judgment or tax lien filed against you; (6) if you make any false, inaccurate, or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update; or (7) if we, in good faith, believe that your ability to repay what you owe is or soon will be impaired, or that you are unwilling to make your payments. 
If you are in default, we have the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying interest charges and fees until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe. You agree to pay all reasonable costs of collection, including court costs and attorney's fees, and any costs incurred in the recovery of the Card, subject to applicable law. Even if your unpaid balance is less than your credit limit, you will have no credit available during any time that any aspect of your account is in default.  
Additional Benefits/Card Enhancements. We may from time to time offer additional services to your Account at no additional cost to you. You understand that we are not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.  
Convenience Checks. We may, at our discretion, issue checks to you which may be used for any purpose other than making a payment for credit to your account. By signing such check, you authorize us to pay the item for the amount indicated and post such amount as a cash advance to your account. We do not have to pay any item which would cause the outstanding balance in your account to exceed your credit limit.  
Credit Information. We may from time to time request personal information from you or obtain credit reports from the credit reporting agencies for the purpose of updating your credit status. Your failure to provide such information when requested by us may result in suspension of credit privileges under this Agreement, including your ability to obtain any future advances by any means. You authorize us to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize us to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureau and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. 
Foreign Transactions; Currency Conversion. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. The conversion rate in dollars will be a rate selected by the card company from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate the card company itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date in each instance. All transactions processed outside of the United States (which may include internet transactions) will be charged a foreign transaction fee in the amount disclosed on your Truth-in-Lending Statement (as amended from time to time). 
Termination; Change-in-Terms. We may, by written notice, terminate this Agreement at any time, subject to applicable law. You may terminate this Agreement by written notice. Termination by either party shall not affect your obligation to repay any payments made for your account resulting from use of the Card as well as Interest Charges and fees incurred. We may change the terms of this Agreement, including the method of calculating the periodic rate, at any time, by written notice, subject to applicable law. Use of the Card constitutes agreement and acceptance of any change in terms, unless applicable law requires otherwise. Our failure to exercise any of our rights or to take any action shall not constitute a waiver of those rights, or an amendment or change in any of the terms of this Agreement.  
Late or Partial Payments. Any payment that delays the reduction of your balance will increase your total interest costs. Partial payments or prepayments will not delay your next scheduled payment - you will still need to make the minimum scheduled payment by the next scheduled due date to keep your account current. We may accept late payments, partial payments, checks or money orders marked ""payment in full"" and such action shall not constitute final settlement of your account or a waiver or forgiveness of any amounts owing under this Agreement. 
Enforcement. We do not lose our rights under this or any related agreement if we delay enforcing them. If any provision of this or any related agreement is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, all other provisions remain in full force and effect. 
Returns and Adjustments. Merchants and others who honor the Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by submitting a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe us, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1 or more, it will be refunded upon your written or verbal request. 
Plan Merchant Disputes. We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor your Card. Also, we are not responsible for goods or services that you purchase with the Card unless: (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement we sent or participated in sending you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50 and was made from a plan merchant in your state or within 100 miles of your home; and only if you have made a good faith attempt, but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant. You must resolve all other disputes directly with the plan merchant. We do not warrant any merchandise or services purchased by you with the Card. 
Statements and Notices. Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the most recent postal address or e-mail address (if you have elected to receive such documents via electronic means) you have given us. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all. 
Notification of Address Change. You will notify us promptly if you change your address for any reason. In order to prevent identity theft, your identity may need to be verified before we act upon the notification. 
Copy Received. You acknowledge that you have received a copy of this Agreement.  
Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed under federal law and state law in the state in which we are primarily located, and the venue shall be located in the county and state in which we are primarily located. Operating regulations of Visa may also apply. This Agreement is the contract that applies to all transactions even though the sales, cash advance, convenience check, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.

BILLING RIGHTS NOTICE


Your Billing Rights: Keep this Document for Future Use
This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.
What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement 
If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at the address(es) listed on your statement. 
In your letter, give us the following information: 
1. Your name and account number.
2. The dollar amount of the suspected error.
3. If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us:
* Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. 
* At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do, we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 
* We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
* The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. 
* While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. 
* We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 
* If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
* If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. 
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct. 
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases 
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at the address(es) listed on your statement.
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

If you are married, by submitting your credit card application you are confirming that this credit card obligation is being incurred in the interest of your marriage and your family. If the credit card for which you are applying is granted, you will notify the Bank if you have a spouse who needs to receive notification that credit has been extended to you.

If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.
4. ABILITY TO REPAY: When you use the Account or permit others to use the Account, you represent that you have the ability and intention to repay all amounts charged to the Account.
5. BILLING STATEMENT: We will send you a billing statement monthly for each billing cycle at the end of which you have a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00, or in which a Interest Charge has been imposed. The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other charges or fees, including credit insurance or debt cancellation (if applicable), and all payments and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle. The billing statement will show the amount owed on your Account. The total Amount owed is called “New Balance” on your billing statement subject to the terms of Promotional Credit Plan purchases, if any, as indicated below.
6. PROMOTIONAL CREDIT PLANS: The following Promotional Credit Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase:   a) Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan – no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase for a specified period, as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; b) Same As Cash/Monthly Payment Credit Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase before the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, Interest Charges will be imposed from the purchase date; c) Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; d) Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan – A special repayment factor will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; e) Special Repayment Factor/Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A special repayment factor and a reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle. All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Credit Plan are referred to as Regular Credit Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Card. Call 1-888-367-4310 or review the Application of Payments section of this Agreement for information.
7. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(iv) a purchase on a Same As Cash Credit Plan if the full cash sales price is paid in full before the promotion expiration date.
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan other than a Same As Cash Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Same As Cash Credit Plan during a cycle, the amount will be the sum of the following daily Interest Charge calculations for the Credit Plan during the current cycle and during each of the prior billing cycles (each a “Prior Cycle”) from the transaction date of the purchase through the current cycle: (i) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for the Current Cycle times the Daily Balance for each day in the current cycle; and (ii) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for each Prior Cycle times the Daily Balances of the Credit Plan for each day during each Prior Cycle.
(e) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) incurred on that day and 4) any late fees, over the credit limit fees, returned payment fees or other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. For any Same As Cash Credit Plan, credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) are not included in the Daily Balance of that Credit Plan during the promotional period. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(f) The Daily Periodic Rate which is used to determine your Interest Charges and the corresponding Annual Percentage Rate, will be variable rates which may change monthly. The Daily Periodic Rate will be one-three hundred sixty fifth of the sum of the U.S. prime rate published in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal that is in effect on the last day of the month (“Prime Rate”) plus a “Spread” of 16.9 percentage points for the Standard Rate and a “Spread” of 23.74 percentage points for the Penalty Rate. Any changes in the Prime Rate will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle beginning in the next month. 
For example, as of the billing cycle beginning August 1, 2011, the Interest Charge for the Standard Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .05521% (corresponding 20.15% Annual Percentage Rate) and the Interest Charge for the Penalty Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .07395% (corresponding 26.99% Annual Percentage Rate). An increase in the Prime Rate will increase your applicable Daily Periodic Rate which may increase the Interest Charge and the Minimum Payment due on your Account. Your APR may increase to the Penalty APR if we fail to receive your minimum payment with in 60 days when due. You will no longer be eligible for the Standard Rate and all existing Promotional Credit Plans will terminate, and your entire Account balance will be subject to the Penalty Rate. If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the new Penalty APR goes into effect.  If you make the next six consecutive on time minimum payments starting with your first payment due once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APR(s) applicable to your Account.  If you do not make these six consecutive on time minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.
8. MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE: A minimum Interest Charge of $2.00 will be assessed for each billing cycle in which an Interest Charge is payable.
9. FEES: We may impose on your Account the following fees, which will be added to your Account when assessed:
a)	Late Payment Fee: A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
	Your Late Payment Fee is $25 for the first occurrence and $35 for additional occurrences during the next six billing cycles. In no event will your Late Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
b)	Returned Payment Fee: A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
	Your Returned Payment Fee is $25.
	In no event will your Returned Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
c)	Payment by Phone Fee: A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment is requested.
d)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
10. INSURANCE: If available and you elect any credit insurance coverage, you authorize us to charge the insurance premium for such insurance to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the insurance premium is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the premium is being assessed. Credit insurance charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
11. DEBT CANCELLATION: If available and you elect debt cancellation, you authorize us to charge the fee for such debt cancellation to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the debt cancellation fee is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the fee is being assessed. Debt cancellation charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
12. MINIMUM PAYMENT: You agree to pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due. Your Minimum Payment due is equal to your Minimum Payment plus the Special Repayment Factor for any Promotional Credit Plans with a special repayment factor plus any debt cancellation fees or credit insurance premiums attributable to any Reduced Rate/Special Repayment Factor Credit plans plus any delinquent amounts. The Minimum Payment is the greater of a.) $25 or b.) 1% of your “New Balance” (which does not include balances on Special Repayment Factor Credit Plans) plus billed Interest Charges plus any Late Fees assessed for that month, rounded to the next highest dollar. Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments, which may affect crediting of your payments.
13. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) not drawn in U.S. dollars on funds on deposit in the U.S.; (b) missing a signature; (c) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (d) restrictively endorsed; (e) postdated; (f) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (g) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to HSBC Retail Services, P.O. Box 5226, Carol Stream, IL 60197-5226. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
14. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances.  If you have a Same As Cash Credit Plan(s), we will automatically apply payments received during the final two complete billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first to the required Minimum Payment Due and next to the plan(s) that is expiring, in the order of expiration; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0% APR for purposes of determining payment application.
15. CREDIT LIMIT: You agree not to let the Account balance exceed the credit limit established for you by us from time to time. We do not have to honor any use of your Card or honor credit card checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit, but if we do, you agree to repay the amount by which your credit limit is exceeded, plus Interest Charges immediately.
16. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of any merchant to accept or honor the Card or a credit card check.
17. SECURITY: Except as indicated below, you grant us a purchase money security interest in the goods purchased with your Card and in all insurance contracts and all proceeds, returned premiums,mechanical failure and extended service contracts, and refunds of charges for mechanical failure and extended service contracts financed therewith. Each good purchased on your Account will secure the entire Account balance until such good is paid in full. For purposes of determining which goods are subject to a security interest, payments received will be deemed to be applied first to any unpaid insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable), Interest Charges and fees and then to pay for purchases on the Account in the order in which they were made. When sufficient payments are made to repay the portion of the Account balance attributable to the purchase of a particular good, we will release our purchase money security interest in that good. Goods covered by a security interest may be taken from you if you do not pay on time. We may require you to make them available at a convenient place of our choice. We take no security interest in goods where the original purchase price is less than $200 if you live in New York and in goods where the original purchase price is less than $700 if you live in Maryland. If we repossess any goods purchased with your Card, we may charge you our repossession cost including, but not limited to, necessary repairs, storage fees and costs of sale, when and as permitted by law.
18. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Total Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your moving out of the U.S. or Canada or providing us with a non-U.S. or non-Canadian mailing address; (l) your becoming incompetent; (m) your exceeding your credit limit; (n) your payment being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (o) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (p) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.

The party initiating the arbitration proceeding shall have the right to select one of the following Administrators: Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) or the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). The arbitrator shall be a lawyer with more than ten years experience or a retired or former judge.

Our address for service of process under this provision is HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., P.O. Box 98740, Las Vegas, NV 89193-8740.
Small Claims Exemption
We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim you may bring in small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration at such time.
Location of Arbitration and Fees
Any participatory arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient to you.  On any Claim you file, you will pay the first $50 of the filing fee. At your request we will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the Administrator on any Claim submitted by you in arbitration up to a maximum of $1,500. If you are required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, we will consider a request by you to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, we shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees unless the arbitrator grants you an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in your favor, we will reimburse you for any additional fees paid or owed by you to the Administrator up  to the amount of the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual award in your favor. The parties shall bear the expense of their respective attorney's fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, or the fees paid to the Administrator, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein. If the arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the Administrator or for which we are responsible.

If a Claim that is within the scope of the first paragraph of the “Claims and Arbitration Administrators” paragraph above is advanced by or against any third person, and any of the persons mentioned in the previous sentence is involved as a party, then the entire Claim is subject to arbitration under this Agreement, including any Claim by or against any third person.
Protection of Information
The rules and procedures of the Administrator, which you may obtain from that organization, shall govern the arbitration unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will control. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, nor to state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. If you or we request, the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized under applicable law and will use best efforts to protect confidential information (including through use of protective orders).
Parties to Arbitration
Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.”
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver.  You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules. In the event of such an appeal, an appeal panel consisting of three arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The panel's decision will be final and binding. Any final decision of the arbitrator or of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as provided under the FAA. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the FAA by any court having jurisdiction.
Consequences of Electing Arbitration
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY EITHER PARTY.

VISA PLATINUM 
CONSUMER CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT 
In this Agreement, �Agreement� means this Consumer Credit Card Agreement. �Disclosure� means the Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement. 
1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will not allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that exceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled �Statements and Notices�) explaining your right to opt in to the Credit Union�s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in to such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. 
You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six 
(6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request.  
2. 
USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers and money orders. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal. 

3. 
PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You 

also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account. 

4. 
PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement.  

5. 
FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle. Finance charge begins to accrue on those purchases from the first day of the next billing cycle, unless you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle�s billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date). 


The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the purchase balance. (We do not add in any purchases posted during the billing cycle.) This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases.  
For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances. 
6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date.  
A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or 
U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
7. FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
a. 
Annual Fee. If your account is subject to an Annual Fee, the fee will be charged to your account upon the issuance of your card. Each year following, the annual fee will be charged to your account during the same month that you were first charged the fee. The fee will be charged each year until your account is closed and paid in full. 

b. 
Account Set-Up Fee. If your account is subject to an Account Set-up Fee, a fee will be charged when you apply for a credit card account. 

c. 
Additional Card Fee. If your account is subject to an Additional Card Fee, a fee will be charged for each additional card issued to you at account opening. 

d. 
Balance Transfer Fee. If your account is subject to a Balance Transfer Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you transfer a balance from an account of another creditor to the account subject to this Agreement. 

e. 
Cash Advance Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Cash Advance Fee (finance charge), the fee will be charged to your account when you obtain a cash advance from an ATM, the Credit Union or other financial institution. 

f. 
Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency.  

g. 
Transaction Fee for Purchases. If your account is subject to a Transaction Fee for Purchases, a fee will be charged to your account for purchases as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 

h. 
Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 

i. 
Over-the-Credit Limit Fee. If you have elected the feature to allow your account to go over your credit limit, we may charge you a fee as allowed by law. However, in no case will we impose an over-the-limit fee except in the next two billing cycles unless you have obtained an additional extension of credit in excess of such credit limit during each subsequent cycle or you have reduced the balance below the credit limit as of the end of each bill cycle. 

j. 
Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when a payment is returned for any reason. 

k. 
Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request. 

l. 
Rush Fee. If your account is subject to a Rush Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each rush card that you request, providing delivery of the card is also available by standard mail service, without paying a fee for delivery. 

m. 
Pay By Phone Fee. If your account is subject to the Pay By Phone Fee, a fee will be charged to your account as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 


8. 
PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 2.00% of your total new balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on the statement. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. 

9. 
PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate.  

10. 
SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount.  



Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement.  
11.
 DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. 

When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe. 

12. 
LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION � You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at 2023 Gold Canyon, San Antonio, TX 78232 or telephone (800) 449-7728 seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00. 

13. 
CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT � As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. 


Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized. 
The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account.  
14. 
CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS � Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user. If you cannot return the authorized user's card or access checks and if you request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for a new account. 

15. 
CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION � You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. If your account is eligible for emergency cash and/or emergency card replacement services, and you request such services, you agree that we may provide personal information about you and your account that is necessary to provide you with the requested service(s). 

16. 
RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS � Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6) months. 

17. 
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS � The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit Union is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time. 

18. 
MERCHANT DISPUTES � The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home. 

19.
 JOINT ACCOUNTS � If this is a joint account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may terminate the account and the termination will be effective as to all of you. 

20.

Your Billing Rights: Keep this Document for Future Use 
This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. 

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement 
If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at: Firstmark Credit Union 2023 Gold Canyon  
San Antonio, TX 78232 You may also contact us on the Web: www.firstmarkcu.org In your letter, give us the following information: 
-	Account information: Your name and account number. 
-	Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
-	Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you 
believe it is a mistake. You must contact us: 
-	Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. 
-	At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you 
think is wrong. You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 
When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 
1. 
Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 

2. 
Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is 


correct.  While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 
-	We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
-	The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. 
-	While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. 
-We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.  After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 
-	
If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. 

-	
If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.  


If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. 
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct. 

Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases 
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. 
To use this right, all of the following must be true: 
1. 
The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 

2. 
You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 


3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing [or electronically] at: Firstmark Credit Union 
2023 Gold Canyon  
San Antonio, TX 78232 
www.firstmarkcu.org 

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

1. Use of Card. You can use your Card to buy or lease goods and obtain services or insurance (�Purchases�) wherever the Card is honored and to get instant cash loans (�Cash Advances�) from any financial institution that accepts the Card. You will owe us for all Purchases and Cash Advances charged by the use of the Card, plus any other charges (�Debits�) to your Account made under the terms of this Agreement, plus any finance charges, all payable in U.S. dollars and as required by this Agreement.

2. Balance Transfers. You may use your Card or Account to transfer balances from other credit card accounts to this Account (�Balance Transfers�) by means (including balance transfer forms) we may make available from time to time. You may not transfer balances from any other account you have with us. 
3. Credit Line. Your Credit Line is listed on Page 1 of your Account Details Disclosure. Your Credit Line may be changed from time to time and your current Credit Line will be listed on your monthly billing statement. We will not authorize Purchases, Balance Transfers, or Cash Advances that cause your account to exceed your Credit Line. 
4. Statements and Payments. If you have a balance or activity on your Account, we will send you a monthly statement that will show, separately, your Purchases/Debits Account, your Cash Advance Account, Balance Transfers Account, finance charges to your Account, the minimum payment due, and the date the payment is due. You can pay all of your outstanding balance on your Card at any time, but you must make at least a minimum payment of 2.5% of your Account balance or $10 (whichever is greater) plus any amount in excess of your Credit Line and any past due amount, within 21 days of the date of each monthly statement. You agree to mail your payments to the address shown on your statement. You will be charged a late charge if a minimum payment is not made before the 29th day of any calendar month in which a payment is due. This late charge will be $15 if your Account balance is $100 or less, $25 if your Account balance is more than $100 but not exceeding $250, and $35 if your Account balance exceeds $250. If any check or any instrument given for payment on the Account is dishonored for any reason, a return payment fee in the amount of $10 will be imposed. Payments received in excess of your minimum payment amount on your Account will be applied to the balances with the highest APR unless the balance is part of a promotional offer where no interest is being charged. 
5. FINANCE CHARGES on Purchases/Debits. If you pay your entire balance for Purchases/Debits within 21 days of the date of the first statement showing such charges and any previous balances, no finance charges are incurred for such Purchases/Debits. If that balance is not paid in full within the required time, a finance charge will be added to your Purchases/Debits from the first day of the billing cycle following the purchase date until they are paid in full, calculated this way: We take the beginning balance of your Purchases/Debits each day, and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid finance charges attributable to the balance for Purchases/Debits. That gives us the daily balance for your Purchases/Debits. We then add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. We multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate times the number of days in the billing cycle. 
6. FINANCE CHARGES on Cash Advances. You will pay a FINANCE CHARGE on Cash Advances from the date the advance is made until the advance is paid in full, computed as follows: We take the beginning balance of your Cash Advances each day, add any new Cash Advances charged on that day, and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid finance charges attributable to the balance for Cash Advances. That gives us the daily balance for your Cash Advances. We then add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. We multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate times the number of days in the billing cycle. 
7. FINANCE CHARGES on Balance Transfers. You will pay a FINANCE CHARGE on Balance Transfers from the date the transfer is made until the Balance Transfer amount is paid in full, computed as follows: We take the beginning balance of your Balance Transfers each day, add any new Balance Transfers charged on that day, and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid finance charges attributable to the balance for Balance Transfers. That gives us the daily balance for your Balance Transfers. We then add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. We multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate times the number of days in the billing cycle. 
8. Transaction Fee FINANCE CHARGE on Cash Advances. You will pay a Cash Advance fee FINANCE CHARGE for each cash advance equal to 3.00% of the amount advanced, but in no event will the cash advance fee be less than $5. 
9. Periodic Rate for Purchases (Standard APR).

Any changes to the Index will be effective on the first day of the next billing cycle and will apply to new Purchases/Debits and to the outstanding balance of your Account. If the daily periodic rate (and corresponding APR) increases, the amount of the finance charge and the minimum payment due may increase. If The Wall Street Journal ceases publication, we will select a new index and notify you of the change.
10. Periodic Rate for Cash Advances. The daily periodic rate and corresponding APR for Cash Advances for each billing cycle will be the sum of (i) the Prime Interest Rate (�Index�) as quoted in the Money Rates Table of The Wall Street Journal on the 20th business day of the previous month and (ii) 13.74%, divided by 365 and rounded up to two decimal places, with a maximum APR of 25%. Any changes to the Index will be effective on the first day of the next billing cycle and will apply to new Cash Advances and to the outstanding Cash Advance balance of your Account. If the daily periodic rate (and corresponding APR) increases, the amount of the finance charge and the minimum payment due may increase. If The Wall Street Journal ceases publication, we will select a new index and notify you of the change.

Page 1 of your Account Details Disclosure.

This notice contains important information about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. 
Notify Us in Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill 
If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet at the address listed on your bill. Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. 
In your letter, give us the following information: 
(1) your name and account number; 
(2) the dollar amount of the suspected error; and 
(3) describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.

Your Rights and Our Responsibilities After We Receive Your Written Notice 
We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill was correct. 
After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for the amount you question, including finance charges, and we can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. 
If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due. 
If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within ten days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. And we must tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is. 
If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct. 

Special Rule for Credit Card Purchases 
If you have a problem with the quality of property or services that you purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or services.

(1) you must have made the purchase in your home state or, if not within your home state, within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and 
(2) the purchase price must have been more than $50. 
These limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or services.

II. BILLING RIGHTS NOTICE 
Your Billing Rights 
Keep This Notice For Future Use 
This notice contains important information about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. 
Notify Us in Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill 
If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet at the address listed on your bill. Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. 
In your letter, give us the following information: 
(1) your name and account number; 
(2) the dollar amount of the suspected error; and 
(3) describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about. 
If you have authorized us to pay your credit card bill automatically from your savings or checking account, you can stop the payment on any amount you think is wrong. To stop the payment your letter must reach us three business days before the automatic payment is scheduled to occur. 
Your Rights and Our Responsibilities After We Receive Your Written Notice 
We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill was correct. 
After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for the amount you question, including finance charges, and we can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. 
If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due. 
If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within ten days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. And we must tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is. 
If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct. 

Special Rule for Credit Card Purchases 
If you have a problem with the quality of property or services that you purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or services. There are two limitations on this right: 
(1) you must have made the purchase in your home state or, if not within your home state, within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and 
(2) the purchase price must have been more than $50. 
These limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or services. 
III. NOTICES AND SIGNATURES 
MARYLAND RESIDENTS: You have the right under Section 12-510 of the Commercial Law Code to receive an answer to a written inquiry concerning the status of your Account. Finance charges will be imposed in amounts or at rates not in excess of those permitted by law. 
NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS: Because certain provisions of this Agreement are subject to applicable laws, they may be void, unenforceable or inapplicable in some jurisdictions. None of these provisions, however, is void, unenforceable or inapplicable in New Jersey. 
NOTICE TO THE BUYER � 1. DO NOT SIGN THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT OR APPLICATION BEFORE YOU READ IT OR IF IT CONTAINS BLANK SPACES. 2. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO A COMPLETELY FILLED IN COPY OF THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT. 3.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called �daily balance�. 

During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying 
the periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following 
balance types, as applicable: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or 
special promotions. 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees 
posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type.

GE MONEY BANK 
CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT 


1. CONTRACT. This Agreement (�Agreement�) is a contract for the extension of credit. It controls your credit card account referenced on the document received with your credit card or 
on your welcome letter. This Agreement includes this document and the following documents: 
� The application or any other document you submitted to us in connection with the account; and 
� The privacy policy that is enclosed with or attached to this document. 
By opening or using your account, you agree to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement starts when (i) you give us an account application we approve or (ii) you use your account or 
let someone else use it, whichever occurs first. 

2. PARTIES. The parties to this Agreement are you and GE Money Bank. GE Money Bank is located at 170 West Election Road, Suite 125, Draper, Utah 84020. GE Money Bank 
sometimes is called �us,� �we� or �our� in this Agreement. 

3. PROMISE TO PAY. You promise to pay us for all credit that we extend on your account, including credit extended when you let another person use your account. You also promise to 
pay us for all other amounts owed to us under this Agreement. 

4. CHANGING TERMS. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may change, add to or delete any of the terms of this Agreement, including the interest rates, 
fees and charges. 

5. GOVERNING LAW. Except as provided in the Dispute and Claim Resolution (Including Arbitration) provision, this Agreement and your account are governed by federal 
law and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of Utah without regard to its conflicts of law principles. This Agreement has been accepted by us in Utah. 

6. CREDIT CARD. We have issued or will send you a credit card for your use. You are not permitted to allow anyone else to use your credit card, but if you do, you will be responsible 
for such use. You will destroy all the credit card(s) issued on your account if we ask you to do so. 

7. AUTHORIZED USER/JOINT ACCOUNT. If you ask us to send a credit card to another person that you want to let use your account, you will be responsible for all transactions made 
by that person. That person will be considered an authorized user. If another person is approved on the account, that person will be considered a joint accountholder. Each joint 
accountholder may use the account and agrees to the terms of this Agreement. No matter which joint accountholder uses the account, each of you must pay back the full amount owed 
on the account. We may treat each of you as one accountholder. For example, giving notice to one of you is considered the same as giving notice to both of you. Also, we may follow the 
instructions that we get from one of you even if they differ from instructions given by the other accountholder. 

8. USING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may use your account only as stated in this Agreement. You may use your account for the following: 
� Purchases. You may buy goods or services; 
� Cash Advances. If applicable, you may get cash advances by writing convenience checks we may provide to you from time to time or by other means we may make available. We 
may not honor a convenience check (i) if you filed for bankruptcy, (ii) if the check is expired, (iii) if your account is closed, (iv) if the amount of the check would exceed your available 
credit or cash advance limit, or (v) as otherwise stated on your convenience check; and 
� Balance Transfers. If applicable, from time to time, we may offer you the chance to transfer balances from your other credit card accounts to this account. Unless we tell you 
otherwise, we will treat balance transfers as purchases. We reserve the right to decline to process any balance transfer request for any reason, and will not transfer a balance from 
any of our affiliates. Transfers will be processed in the order determined by us. If the amount you wish to transfer is greater than your available credit limit, we may reject the 
request(s). It may take up to four weeks for a balance transfer request to be credited to your other credit card account(s). It is your responsibility to make any payments required to 
keep your other account(s) current and to close your other account(s), if you desire. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur on your other account(s) as a result of 
your balance transfer(s). If you have a dispute with a creditor, and pay the balance in question by transferring it to your account, you may lose certain dispute rights. 

You may use your account only for lawful personal, family or household purposes. You may not use your account for internet gambling or illegal purposes. You may not use your account 
to pay amounts you owe us on this account or on other accounts you have with us. These restrictions are for our benefit, and we are not responsible to you for enforcing them. 

9. CREDIT AND CASH ADVANCE LIMITS. 
A. Assigning Limits. We will assign the following limit(s) on your account, as applicable. We may increase or decrease either or both of these limits at any time. 

Credit Limit � This is the highest amount of total credit we will extend to you on your account. 

Cash Advance Limit � This is the highest amount of credit we will extend to you for cash advances made on your account, if applicable. Cash transactions will also count 
towards your credit limit. 

B. Exceeding Limits. We may refuse to authorize you to use your account if that use (including any fees associated with that use) will cause the total you will owe on your account to 
be more than your credit limit. If applicable, you may not get a cash advance if that cash advance (including interest and cash advance fees) will cause the total you will owe for 
cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit. If we approve a transaction that causes the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit 
limit or, if applicable, the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit, we do not give up any of our rights under this Agreement 
and we do not treat it as an increase in your credit limit or, if applicable, cash advance limit. 

C. Limiting Transactions. We reserve the right to not approve transactions on your account. To prevent fraud, we may also limit the number or dollar amount of transactions you can 
make in a particular amount of time. 

10. INTEREST. This section explains (i) the interest rates that will apply to your account, (ii) when interest will be charged on your account, and (iii) how the amount of interest is calculated. 

A. Rates. The following rates apply to purchases and, if applicable, cash advances. A higher rate, which we call a �Penalty APR� may apply at certain times as described below. The 
Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account are shown in the table above and will also be shown on your billing statement. 
We calculate interest on the balance of your account each day. We use a daily rate to calculate the interest each day. The daily rate is equal to the APR divided by 365. 

1. Purchase Rate. The daily rate for purchases is .07394% (APR 26.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
2. Cash Advance Rate. The daily rate for cash advances is .08216% (APR 29.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
3. Penalty Rate. The penalty rate may apply if you do not make your total minimum payment by the payment due date and will continue to apply as provided in this section. As 
required by law, we will provide you with advance notice if we are going to apply the penalty rate to your account and we will tell you when the penalty rate will apply. 
a. What is the Penalty Rate? The daily penalty rate will be .08216% (APR 29.99%). 
b. How Long Will the Penalty Rate Apply? If you are not more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to transactions made on your account after a date 
specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make all required payments by the payment due date for six consecutive billing periods, your rate will return to the 
standard APR; otherwise, the penalty rate will apply indefinitely. 

If you are or become more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to all balances and new transactions on your account not already subject to the penalty 
rate as specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make six consecutive minimum payments by the payment due date, starting with your first payment due 
date after the date specified in the advance notice, your rate for any balances created on your account prior to or within 14 days after the date of the advance notice 
that are not already subject to (or scheduled under a prior notice to be subject to) the penalty rate will return to the standard APR. If you do not make these six consecutive 
minimum payments, we may apply the penalty rate to all balances on your account indefinitely. 

B. When We Charge Interest. 
1. Purchases. We charge interest on your purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full, except as set forth below: 
� We will not charge you interest during a billing cycle on any purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the billing cycle or (ii) you had such a balance, you paid 
that balance in full by the due date in that billing cycle. 
� We will credit, as of the beginning of the billing cycle, any payment you make by the due date that we allocate to purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the 
previous billing cycle, or (ii) if you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in the previous billing cycle. 

2. Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. If applicable, we charge interest on your balance transfers and cash advances (and their related fees) from the date you make the 
transaction until you pay them in full. You cannot avoid paying interest on balance transfers or cash advances or on their fees. 

C. How We Calculate Interest. During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the 
periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types, as applicable: 
purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 
� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract 
any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. We charge a minimum of $2 of 
interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest. 

11. FEES. We may charge some or all of the following fees. The table at the beginning of this Agreement shows the amount of each of the maintenance, transaction and penalty fees. 
A. A monthly Maintenance Fee each month your account is open and has a balance greater than zero. 

B. Transaction Fees. 
1. A Balance Transfer Fee for each balance transfer you make. 
2. A Cash Advance Fee for each cash advance you get. 
3. An Activation Fee at the time the first Purchase posts to your Account. 

C. Penalty Fees. 
1. A Late Payment Fee if we do not receive at least the total minimum payment due on your account by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the due date shown on your statement. The amount 
of the late payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if you have paid at least your total minimum payment due by the payment due date in each of the prior six billing cycles or 
(2) $35 if you have failed to pay at least the total minimum payment due by the payment due date in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the late 
payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for which the late payment fee is assessed, the amount of the late payment fee will instead be equal to the 
amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

2. A Returned Payment Fee if any check or other instrument sent to us, or any electronic payment authorization you provide us in payment on your account, is not honored 
upon first presentment, even if the check, instrument or electronic authorization is later honored. The amount of the returned payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if 
your payments have been honored upon first presentment in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any payment has been dishonored upon first presentment in any 
one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the returned payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for the cycle in which the payment was dishonored 
upon first presentment, the amount of the returned payment fee will instead be equal to the amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

D. Other Fees. 
1. A Returned Convenience Check Fee of up to $35 if we do not honor a convenience check because (i) it will cause you to go over your cash advance limit, (ii) you filed a 
petition in bankruptcy, (iii) the check is expired, or (iv) your account is closed. The amount of the returned convenience check fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if your convenience 
checks have been honored in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any convenience check has been dishonored in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. 
However, if the returned convenience check fee would exceed the amount of the dishonored convenience check, the amount of the returned convenience check fee will 
instead be equal to the amount of the dishonored convenience check. 

2. A Stop Payment Fee of $39.99 if we stop payment on any convenience check at your request. 

12. YOUR PAYMENTS. 
A. Required Payment and Crediting of Payment. Each billing cycle you must pay at least the total minimum payment by 5:00 pm (ET) on the payment due 
date. You may at any time pay more than the total minimum payment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payment may reduce the 
amount of interest you will pay. Any payments received after 5:00 pm (ET) will be credited as of the next day. We may delay making credit available 
on your account in the amount of your payment. 

B. Minimum Payment. Your total minimum payment is the greatest of (a) $35, (b) 2.5% of your highest New Balance for the life of your account, or (c) 
the interest and late payment fees billed on your statement plus $20. As used in this paragraph, �new balance� excludes any balance attributable to 
any special promotion that involves delayed or special payments. We round up to the next highest whole dollar in figuring your total minimum 
payment. If your new balance on your billing statement is less than $35, then your total minimum payment will be equal to the new balance. 

C. How to Make a Payment. To make a payment you must follow all the instructions below and the instructions on your billing statement. If you do not follow these instructions, credit 
of your payment to your account may be delayed up to five days. 
1. Do the following: (a) make your payment in United States dollars by check, money order, or similar instrument from a bank located in the U.S; (b) send the payment coupon 
from your billing statement with your payment; (c) send the payment and payment coupon in the envelope provided with your billing statement to the payment address listed on 
your billing statement; and (d) send only one payment and one payment coupon in each envelope. Alternatively you may make your payment online at the website address 
shown on your billing statement provided you make your payment in United States dollars from a bank located in the U.S. 
2. Do not do the following: (a) staple, paper clip, tape or fold your payment or payment coupon; (b) include any other papers or items with your payment; (c) use a balance 
transfer or convenience check from your account to pay us; or (d) send us cash. 

D. Other Ways to Make a Payment. Certain participating stores or providers may take payments that you make to them as a convenience to you. We may not credit those payments 
to your account until we receive them. We may allow you to make payments over the phone as an accommodation to you, but we may charge you a fee to do so. 

E. Disputed Amounts. If you send us correspondence about a disputed amount, you must send it to the address for billing inquiries shown on your billing statement. 
You may not send it to the payment address shown on your billing statement. By �disputed amount,� we mean a payment of less than the full balance on your account 
that is labeled as �payment in full� or similar language, or is given to us as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, or is given to us with other conditions or limitations. 
We may accept these types of payments without giving up any of our rights. 

F. Authorization. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or 
to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon 
as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. 

G. Payment Allocation. We reserve the right to select the method by which the required minimum payment is allocated to different balances on your account. Some or all of the 
required minimum payment on your account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. The payment allocation method that we use may result in higher 
interest on your account or reduced savings attributable to any special promotions. Any payment you make in excess of the required minimum payment will be allocated to 
balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs, unless applicable law requires or permits otherwise (such as when your account has a certain type of special 
promotion). 

13. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS. At times, we may offer you special promotions when you use your account for certain transactions. These special promotions will have some terms that 
are different from the terms in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement apply to any special promotion, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the special promotion. We 
may terminate your participation in any special promotion and/or apply the penalty rate to your account balances (including special promotion balances) if you become more than 60 days 
late on any payment due on your account. If this happens, each special promotion balance will no longer be subject to the terms of the special promotion and will instead be subject to the 
terms of this Agreement. A promotional charge may be charged as part of a special promotion. Please see any special promotion advertising (including in-store signs) or other disclosures 
provided to you for the full terms of any special promotion offered. 

14. SECURITY INTEREST. You grant us a purchase money security interest in each item of merchandise purchased on your account to secure its unpaid purchase price until such 
merchandise is paid in full. Solely for the purpose of determining the extent of our purchase money security interest in each such item of merchandise, your payments will be allocated 
first to interest on the account, and then to pay off each purchase on the account in the order in which the purchase was made (if more than one item was purchased on the same day, 
your payments will be allocated to pay off the lowest priced item first). If you made a purchase pursuant to a credit promotion, the balance with respect to the promotional purchase may 
be shown on statements during the promotional period and may reflect a different payment allocation method. In no event will we assert a security interest in the promotional purchase for 
an amount greater than the lowest balance shown on a statement for that promotional purchase. We agree that no security interest is or will be retained or acquired under this agreement 
in any real property which is used or is expected to be used as your dwelling. Should we feel it necessary, you authorize us to sign and file financing statements regarding any vehicle 
purchased. 

For some individual purchases under your account, we may require you to maintain property/casualty insurance on the purchase as a condition of granting you credit. You will be 
informed of any property/casualty insurance requirement at the time you make the purchase. 

15. UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should call us immediately at 1-800-250-5411. 
You will not be liable for any unauthorized use on your account. 

You agree that unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given your card or allowed use of your account. You will be responsible for all use by such a 
person. 

16. YOUR CREDIT REPORTS AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION. 
A. Using and Sharing Your Information. When you applied for an account you gave us information about yourself. You also agreed that we could ask others for information about 
your creditworthiness and that we could ask consumer reporting agencies for your consumer report. We use this information in considering your application. We also use this

with offers. We may give information about you or your account to consumer reporting agencies and other proper parties. This information may include your performance under this 
Agreement.

Box 981439, El Paso, TX 79998-1439. In your written communication, tell us what information is wrong and why you think it is wrong. If you have a copy of the credit 
report that includes the wrong information, send a copy of it with your written communication. We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late 
payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. 

17. USE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOUR ACCOUNT. We will give information about you and your account to dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals 
that accept this credit card (and their affiliates) and you consent to this. Dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals will use the information in connection with the credit 
card program and for things like creating and updating their records and offering you special benefits. We will use information about you and your account as set forth in the privacy policy 
that is attached to or enclosed with this document. 

18. CHANGE OF ADDRESS/PHONE NUMBER. You agree to tell us right away if you change your address or phone number(s). We will contact you at the address in our records until 
we are able to update our records with your new address. 

19. CONSENT TO COMMUNICATIONS. You consent to us contacting you using all channels of communication and for all purposes (including collection purposes), using all contact 
information you provide to us. You also consent to us and any other owner or servicer of your account contacting you about your account, including using text messages, any automatic 
telephone dialing system and/or an artificial or prerecorded voice when contacting you, even if you are charged for the call under your phone plan. You are responsible for any charges for 
contacting you that may be billed to you by your communications carriers. 

20. TELEPHONE MONITORING. For quality control purposes, you permit us to listen to or record telephone calls between you and us. 

21. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. 
A. When You May Close Your Account. 
You may close your account at any time by writing or calling us and asking us to close your account. You must send this writing to the 
address shown on your billing statement or call us at the customer service number shown on your billing statement. We will close your account after we get your request. 
B. When We May Close Your Account. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may close your account at any time and for any reason. 
C. After You or We Close Your Account. 
If you or we close your account, you must stop using it. You will still have to pay us the full amount you owe on your account. This 
Agreement controls your account until you pay it in full. 

22. DEFAULT. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, you are in default if you: 
� Make a late payment; 
� Do not follow any other term of this Agreement; or 
� Become bankrupt or insolvent. 
If you default or upon your death, we may, subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law: (i) make the full amount owing on your account due right away; (ii) bring a legal 
action to collect all amounts owed; and/or (iii) take any action allowed by law. We may also reduce your credit limit or close your account at any time whether or not you are in default. 

23. COLLECTION COSTS. If we ask an attorney to collect your account, we may charge you our collection costs. Collection costs may include court costs, reasonable attorneys� fees 
and fees for repossession, repair, storage and sale of any vehicle securing a purchase. We will charge these costs only if the attorney we ask to collect is not our salaried employee and 
the law allows us to do so. 

24. DISPUTE AND CLAIM RESOLUTION (INCLUDING ARBITRATION) PROVISION. 
General/Requirement to Arbitrate. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION 
WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A 
COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS 
INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED. This Provision replaces any existing arbitration provision with us and will stay in force no matter 
what happens to your account, including termination. 

Upon demand, and except as otherwise provided below, you and we must arbitrate individually any dispute or claim between you, any joint cardholder and/or any additional cardholder, 
on the one hand; and us, our affiliates, agents and/or dealers/merchants/retailers or participating professionals, on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises from or relates to your 
account. However, we will not require you to arbitrate: (1) any individual case in small claims court or your state�s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court; or 
(2) any claim by us that only involves our effort to collect money you owe us. However, if you respond to a collection lawsuit by claiming that we engaged in any wrongdoing, we may 
require you to arbitrate. 

YOU AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. ALSO, YOU 
MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ON BEHALF OF ANY CARDHOLDER WHO IS NOT A JOINT OR ADDITIONAL CARDHOLDER WITH YOU ON YOUR ACCOUNT (AN 
�UNRELATED CARDHOLDER�), AND YOU AGREE THAT NO UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY BRING ANY CLAIMS AGAINST US ON YOUR BEHALF. CLAIMS BY YOU AND 
BY AN UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY NOT BE JOINED IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. Only a court may decide whether any part of this paragraph is enforceable. If it is finally 
determined that this paragraph is not fully enforceable, only this sentence of the Provision will remain in force and the remainder of the Provision will be null and void, provided that the 
court�s determination concerning the enforceability of this paragraph shall be subject to appeal. 

Starting an Arbitration. If you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, the electing party must notify the other party in writing. This notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit and can be

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We will use a method called �average daily balance (including new purchases).�  See your account agreement for more details.

Variable Rate: After the introductory rate period, the variable APR for purchases and balance transfers will equal the sum of the Prime Rate as listed in the Money Rates section of the Eastern edition of The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of each month, plus a margin of 16.99%, subject to a maximum of the lesser of 18.00% APR or the highest APR then permitted by applicable law. The variable APR for cash advances will equal the sum of the Prime Rate, plus a margin of 17.99%, subject to a maximum of the lesser of 18.00% APR or the highest APR then permitted by applicable law. 

Periodic Rates and Corresponding APRs: During the introductory period of 6 months, the monthly Periodic Rate for purchases and balance transfers is 0.333% which is an APR of 3.99%. After that, assuming no change in the Prime Rate, the monthly Periodic Rate for purchases and balance transfers will be 1.5%, which is an APR of 18.00%. The initial monthly Periodic Rate for cash advances is 1.50%, which is an APR of 18.00%.

Billing Rights: Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided in your account agreement.



VISA� PLATINUM AND VISA� PLATINUM REWARDS VARIABLE RATE                                                  CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE

DEFINITIONS: �Card� means the VISA� Platinum Credit Card or VISA� Platinum Rewards Credit Card, as the case may be, which we issue to you under this agreement, including any duplicates or renewals, and includes any device or check used to obtain credit or cash from the account. The words �you�, �your�, and �Cardholder� mean each person jointly and individually who holds, signs, retains, uses, or permits others to use or sign a Card. The words �our�, �we� and �us� mean FAIRWINDS Credit Union or any of its assignees. Unless otherwise stated �account� means your VISA� Credit Card Line of Credit with us.

1. We agree to extend credit to you and advance amounts up to your credit limit. We will notify you of your maximum credit limit. Upon receipt of your Card, you will immediately sign the back of the Card to ensure proper use. You agree to pay us for credit extended pursuant to the use of the Card by you or any other cardholders together with all applicable finance charges, and in accordance with the terms of this agreement. You agree by signing, using or permitting others to use the Card to the terms and conditions contained in this agreement, on the Card, or any charge slip resulting from authorized use of the Card and on any authorized cash advance slip.

2. We will have no liability or responsibility if any merchant refuses to honor the Card. No cash refund will be made to you with respect to any adjustment for goods or services purchased. All adjustments will be made by credit to your account by an executed credit voucher issued by the appropriate merchant.

3. You agree to use the Card only within the credit limit authorized by us. You also agree that we can change your credit limit at any time. Any extension of credit to you, made or honored by us, shall be at such times, in such amounts and for such purposes as shall conform to this agreement and only in the event there does not exist any default. We are not obligated to accept charges which would cause you to exceed your credit limit.

4. You agree to advise us of any change in your financial condition which may affect your creditworthiness and to provide us with a current loan application whenever we request one.

5. You agree to make a good-faith effort to resolve any billing error dispute.

6. You agree to pay all charges (purchases, balance transfers and cash advances) on your account made by you or anyone who you authorize to use your account. Your obligation to pay the amount owed on your account continues until paid in full even though an agreement, divorce decree, or other court judgment to which we are not a party may direct someone else to pay the account balance. If more than one person is subject to this agreement, each is individually responsible for all amounts owed. This means we can enforce this agreement against any of you individually or all of you together.

7. You also agree that we can change the terms of this agreement at any time, as long as we give you written notice as required by law before the change becomes effective. Use of your account on or after the effective date of any change will constitute your acceptance of the new terms. Any changes to the agreement may apply to all outstanding indebtedness. This includes any indebtedness which shall have arisen out of purchases, balance transfers and cash advances made by you on the effective date of the changes.

8. We may disclose information about your account in order to advise third parties, such as credit bureaus or merchants, of the existence or condition of your account, or if you give us written permission, or in order to comply with a government agency of court orders.

9. You will be in default if your payment is 3 or more days late or you break one of your promises under this agreement. If you are in default, we can declare the entire balance of your account due at once, without notice. We can do this if you make any false or misleading statements on any request for an advance. If collection is necessary, you agree to pay all the costs of collection including reasonable attorney�s fee and court costs.

10. THE CARD. Upon receipt of the Card(s) you and all other cardholders will sign the signature panel on the back of the Card(s). The Card remains our property and may be revoked by us without notice at any time. The Card must be surrendered to us (or our agent designated to repossess it) upon demand or revocation. If we employ an agent for such repossession, your account will be charged with any related fee. You will remain responsible to pay the amount you owe us according to the terms of this agreement. If this account is jointly held, either of the joint cardholders may terminate the account at anytime by returning all Cards issued under this agreement to us. Such action will not relieve either of the joint cardholders or any other cardholder from liability for repayment of any obligations arising from the use of the account.

11. ISSUANCE AND USE OF CONVENIENCE CHECKS. If we issue you convenience checks, they are processed as cash advances and accumulate finance charges from the date the check posts to your account. Convenience Checks may only be used by the person whose name is printed on them. We may refuse to issue or reissue, and may also terminate, limit, or modify the use of, the checks without notice to you, and you agree to surrender the checks upon our demand or upon learning of our cancellation or withdrawal of the checks. All the terms and conditions of this agreement apply to the checks and balance transfers. Only checks, balance transfers and other methods authorized by us now and into the future may be used to obtain funds from this account, and if so authorized by us, your use of a personal identification number (PIN) for such purposes shall constitute your signature. Paid convenience checks and balance transfer checks become our property and will not be returned to you. Copies may be provided, if requested, for a nominal fee per item. Should we decline to pay any convenience check or balance transfer, we shall not be liable for any action we take regarding payment or nonpayment of a convenience check or balance transfer. You will not date any check later than the date you write it. If you do and the check is presented for payment before its date, we may return it unpaid.

12. ANNUAL FEE. There is no annual fee at this time. You will receive prior written notice should we decide to impose an annual fee.

13. PAYMENTS. A payment is due each month. Your payments must be mailed to the address indicated on the monthly statement. All payments will be credited to your account promptly, in most cases as of the day of receipt and in no case more than 5 business days from the date of receipt. Your Card account (16-digit) number should always be written on the bottom left hand corner of your check or money order. You understand and agree that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, payments will be applied in the following order (1) finance charge, (2) annual, late, overlimit or NSF fee (if applicable), (3) previous transfer balances (4) previous balance cash advances, (5) previous balance purchases, (6) new transfer balances (7) new cash advances, (8) new purchases. All payments made to your account must be in US dollars and drawn on a US bank. You agree that purchases and cash advances made on foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed to you in US dollars. Your minimum payment due is the greater of $20 or 2% of the �new balance� plus the �past due� amount, and/or all amounts in excess of the authorized credit line/limit shown on the periodic statement. If the new balance does not exceed $20, only the �new balance� is due and is shown as the �minimum payment due�. All �past due� or �overlimit� amounts are due and must be fully paid immediately upon notification. You may pay the total amount due, which is shown as the new balance, or you may pay any additional amount you wish over the �minimum payment due�.

14. LATE CHARGES: If you do not make the minimum payment due by the 3rd day after the due date, there will be a late charge of $25, in the case of the first violation, or $35, in the case of any additional violation during any six consecutive billing cycles; provided, however, the late charge shall in no case exceed the amount of the required minimum payment due. Any late payment charge you owe us will be added to your account but will not be included in any finance charge calculation.

15. RETURN PAYMENT: If a payment is returned, there will be a return payment charge of $25, in the case of the first violation, or $30, in the case of any additional violation during any six consecutive billing cycles; provided, however, the return payment charge shall in no case exceed the amount of the required minimum payment due. Any return payment charge you owe us will be added to your account but will not be included in any finance charge calculation.

16. CASH ADVANCE WITHDRAWALS LIMITS: ATM cash advance withdrawals shall be limited to $505 daily, and cash advances made at any financial institution branch shall be limited to $1,500.

17. CASH ADVANCE FEES: For each cash advance, a fee of 4% will be charged. The minimum cash advance fee is $10. Cash advance transactions are defined as ATM withdrawals, Convenience Checks, and cash advances made at any financial institution branch.

18. BALANCE TRANSFER FEES: For each balance transfer, a fee of 3% will be charged. The minimum balance transfer fee is $5. 

19. FINANCE CHARGE. The FINANCE CHARGE (INTEREST) for purchases and balance transfers will equal the sum of the Prime Rate as listed in the Money Rates Section of Eastern edition of the Wall Street Journal on the last business day of each month plus a margin based upon your cumulative credit history. Your margin, initial monthly Periodic Rate and corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) for purchases and balance transfers are as set forth in the Account Opening Disclosures provided to you at the time of the delivery of this agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. The FINANCE CHARGE for purchases and balance transfers will be subject to a maximum of the lesser of 18.00% APR or the highest APR then permitted by applicable law. The FINANCE CHARGE (INTEREST) for cash advances will equal the sum of the Prime Rate plus 17.99%, subject to a maximum of the lesser of 18.00% APR or the highest APR then permitted by applicable law. If the index is discontinued or is no longer available, a successor index setting forth the prime rate will be chosen by us.  To avoid incurring an additional FINANCE CHARGE on purchases and balance transfers reflected on your periodic statement and on any new purchases and balance transfers appearing on your next statement, you must pay the new balance for purchases and balance transfers shown on the periodic statement on or before the Payment Due Date. The FINANCE CHARGES for a billing cycle are computed by applying the monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of  (i) purchases and balance transfers, or (ii) cash advances, as the case may be, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Separate average daily balances are calculated for (i) purchases and balance transfers, and (ii) cash advances. Each daily balance of (i) purchases and balance transfers, or (ii) cash advances, as the case may be, is determined by adding to the previous balance of (i) purchases and balance transfers, or (ii) cash advances, as the case may be, any new (i) purchases and balance transfers, or (ii) cash advances, as the case may be, posted to your account and subtracting any payments as received and credits posted to your account and applied to (i) purchases and balance transfers, or (ii) cash advances, as the case may be, but excluding any unpaid FINANCE CHARGES. FINANCE CHARGES will begin to accrue on Cash Advances, including Bank Cash Advances, Convenience Checks, and ATMs from the date of the transaction. Fees are not included in the calculation of the average daily balance. Finance charges will continue to accrue on your account until what you owe under this agreement is paid in full.

20. VARIABLE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR): The Variable ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances will be based on the Prime Rate as published in the Money Rates Section of the Eastern edition of The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of each month and your cumulative credit history. Changes in the Prime Rate will cause changes in the APR. Changes in the APR as the result of changes in the Prime Rate will be effective on the first day of the next month following one full billing cycle after any change in the Prime Rate. If the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE increases or decreases, the FINANCE CHARGE will increase or decrease. Any increase in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and its corresponding monthly periodic rate and daily periodic rate will result in more finance charges and higher minimum periodic payments. Each change in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and Monthly Periodic Rate will apply to any balance outstanding on the effective date of such change as well as to future credit purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. The APR will not increase above the lesser of the maximum rate allowed by law or 18.00%.

21. CASH ADVANCE APR. Cash Advance ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will be the Prime Rate plus 17.99% for all bank cash advances, ATM cash advances, and convenience checks.

22. ASSIGNMENT OF ACCOUNT. You agree that we may at any time sell, transfer or assign your account to another financial institution.

23. LOST OR STOLEN CARD. You are responsible for the possession and use of the Card and must maintain the confidentiality of the PIN we may assign you. You will notify us if you believe your Card has been lost, stolen or if you have reason to believe that the Card is being used without your permission immediately. You may notify security by calling 1.800.449.7728 seven (7) days a week twenty-four (24) hours a day.

24. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE. You are liable for all authorized use of any Card issued under this agreement regardless of the credit limit or the party using it. You also may be liable for the unauthorized use of your Card as follows: 1) If you tell us after learning of the loss or theft of the card, your liability for unauthorized transactions using the VISA system is Zero; 2) For card transactions through a non-VISA network, VISA Commercial Cards, VISA or Plus ATM, or any ATM transactions, or to cards issued outside the United States, if you tell us within two (2) business days after learning of the loss or theft of the Card, your liability for unauthorized transactions is $50.00; 3) For ATM transactions, your liability for unauthorized transactions is $500.00 if you do not tell us within two (2) business days; and 4) if you do not tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was mailed, you may not get any money you lost if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had you told us in time. The term �unauthorized� does not include any transaction from which you receive a benefit or any transaction by a person with actual, implied, or apparent authority to use the Card. We may require you to provide a written statement regarding claims of unauthorized transactions. If we determine that you have been grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handing of your account or Card, your liability may increase. These rules do not apply to other electronic transfers. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us orally at 1.800.449.7728, or in writing to Customer Service, P.O. Box 31112, Tampa, FL 33631-3112. You agree to cooperate with us in the recovery of any amounts advanced based on such unauthorized use.

25. STATEMENTS AND NOTICES. We will bill you monthly, on a date selected by us, for amounts due under this agreement. Upon receipt of each periodic statement you should examine it and immediately notify us in writing of any transaction you believe to be in error to Customer Service, P.O. Box 31112, Tampa, FL 33631-3112. Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the most recent address you have given us. You agree to notify us promptly of any change in your name, address and phone number. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all of you.

26. SECURITY INTEREST. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares for this account, your pledged shares will secure your charge account. You pledge as security for the charge account all shares and dividends and, if any, all deposits and interest in all joint and individual accounts you have with us now or in the future. Also, any property you give as security will secure all amounts owed under this agreement and all other loans you have with us now or in the future, except any loan secured by your principle dwelling. Your pledge does not apply to any Individual Retirement Account or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. Property securing other loans you have with us may also secure this agreement.

27. MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENT. You must be and remain a Member in good standing with us to be eligible for continuing Account and/or Card privileges including future purchases and advances. We may suspend the Account and/or Card privileges, including closing the Account, if you do not maintain your Membership with us.

28. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS: Purchases, Cash Advances, and credits made in foreign currencies will be billed to your Account in U.S. dollars. The conversion to U.S. dollars will be made in accordance with the Visa� operating regulations for international transactions. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa� from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable Central Processing Date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa� itself receives, or the government- mandated rate in effect for the applicable Central Processing Date in each instance, plus a two percent (2%) foreign transaction fee. This fee will also apply to foreign transactions which do not require a conversion to US dollars. The conversion rate may be different than the rate on the day of the transaction or date of posting of the Account. When a credit to the Account does not fully offset a charge to the Account due to changes in the rate, you are responsible for the difference.

29. ILLEGAL USE. You may use your FAIRWINDS Credit Union credit Card for any transaction permitted by law. You may not use your Card for any gambling purposes, either legal or illegal. You agree that illegal use and/or use in gambling activities of this Card will be deemed an action of default and/or breach of contract and such service and/or other related services may be terminated at our discretion. You further agree, should illegal use occur, to waive the right to sue us for such illegal activity directly or indirectly related to it. You also agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any suits or other legal action or liability, directly or indirectly, resulting from such use.

30. OTHER AGREEMENTS. All the terms and conditions of any other agreement between us and you and/or any other institution that is part of a network of automated teller machines (ATM) in which we participate, and any applicable rules and regulations, also apply to use of the Card. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this agreement and the terms of other agreement or sales, cash advance, credit or other slips you sign or receive, the terms of this agreement shall govern. There may be minimum and/or maximum limits on the amount of a cash advance dispensed from electrical terminals which accept the Card. All of the transactions made by electronic means are subject to verification by us. You agree that we do not waive our rights under this agreement if we fail to assert them. The agreement binds and benefits us and our successors and assigns and binds you, your estate and your personal representatives. 

31.  INVALIDITY OF PROVISIONS AND CAPTIONS. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid the rest of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.  The paragraph headings are for convenience only and do not form a part of this Agreement.

32.  GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE.  The terms and conditions of this Agreement are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida and any applicable Federal law. The venue for any legal action or claim you make against the Credit Union will be Orange County, Florida. 

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS - KEEP THIS DOCUMENT FOR FUTURE USE

This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

What to do if you find a mistake on your statement

If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at: 
	
	Customer Service
	P.O. Box 31112
	Tampa, FL 33631-3112

You may also contact us on the web: www.fairwinds.org
In your letter, give us the following information:

* Account information:  Your name and account number
* Dollar amount:  The dollar amount of the suspected error
* Description of problem:  If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.

You must contact us:

* Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
* At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter

When we receive your letter, we must do two things:

1.	Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2. 	Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
       
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:

* We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
* The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
* While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
* We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:

1. If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
2. If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.

If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.

To use this right, all of the following must be true:

1. 	The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50.  (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. 	You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3.	You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing or electronically at:
	
	Customer Service
	P.O. Box 31112
	Tampa, FL 33631-
	www.fairwinds.org

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

Terms and Conditions
How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called ""average daily balance (including new purchases)"".
Billing Rights: Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided in this Cardholder Agreement.
You may pay the entire New Balance on your Account at any time.
NOTICE FOR MARRIED WISCONSIN RESIDENTS: No provision of a marital property agreement, unilateral statement under Section 766.59 of the Wisconsin Statutes, or court order under Section 766.70 of the Wisconsin Statutes adversely affects the interest of the creditor unless the creditor, prior to the time the credit is granted, is furnished a copy of the agreement, statement or decree or has actual knowledge of the adverse provision when the obligation to the creditor is incurred. If you are married, by submitting your credit card application you are confirming that this credit card obligation is being incurred in the interest of your marriage and your family. If the credit card for which you are applying is granted, you will notify the Bank if you have a spouse who needs to receive notification that credit has been extended to you.
CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
1. GENERAL: Each person signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application for a credit card account (“Account”) as applicant or joint applicant applies for an Account with HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., a national banking association, and requests one or more credit card(s) bearing the name or tradename of Darvin Furniture to be used in connection with the Account. The word “Card” means any credit card(s) issued to you or an authorized user of your Account. In this Agreement, the words “you” and “your” refer to the applicant and joint applicant named on the credit card application and the words “we”, “us” and “our” refer to HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., located at 1111 Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144.
If your application is approved, “applicant” will be referred to as “primary cardholder” and “joint applicant” will be referred to as “secondary cardholder” for purposes of this agreement.
If we accept your application to open an Account, you agree that you will only purchase goods and services for personal, family and household purposes from merchants which honor the Card.
2. ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT: By a) signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application, using or permitting others to use the Card, b) signing or permitting others to sign sales slips; or c) making or permitting others to make purchases by telephone, Internet, or any other means, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Cardholder Agreement and Disclosure Statement, which includes an arbitration provision.
3. PROMISE TO PAY: You agree to pay all amounts charged to the Account, whether incurred by you or anyone you authorize or permit to use your Account or Card. If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.
4. ABILITY TO REPAY: When you use the Account or permit others to use the Account, you represent that you have the ability and intention to repay all amounts charged to the Account.
5. BILLING STATEMENT: We will send you a billing statement monthly for each billing cycle at the end of which you have a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00, or in which an Interest Charge has been imposed. The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other charges or fees, including credit insurance or debt cancellation (if applicable), and all payments and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle. The billing statement will show the amount owed on your Account. The total Amount owed is called “New Balance” on your billing statement subject to the terms of Promotional Credit Plan purchases, if any, as indicated below.
6. PROMOTIONAL CREDIT PLANS: The following Promotional Credit Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase: a) Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan – no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase for a specified period, as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; b) Same As Cash/Monthly Payment Credit Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase before the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, Interest Charges will be imposed from the purchase date; c) Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; d) Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan – A special repayment factor will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; e) Special Repayment Factor/Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A special repayment factor and a reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle.  All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Credit Plan are referred to as Regular Credit Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Card. Call 1-888-367-4310 or review the Application of Payments section of this Agreement for information.
7. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(iv) a purchase on a Same As Cash Credit Plan if the full cash sales price is paid in full before the promotion expiration date.
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan other than a Same As Cash Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Same As Cash Credit Plan during a cycle, the amount will be the sum of the following daily Interest Charge calculations for the Credit Plan during the current cycle and during each of the prior billing cycles (each a “Prior Cycle”) from the transaction date of the purchase through the current cycle: (i) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for the Current Cycle times the Daily Balance for each day in the current cycle; and (ii) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for each Prior Cycle times the Daily Balances of the Credit Plan for each day during each Prior Cycle.
(e) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) incurred on that day and 4) any late fees, over the credit limit fees, returned payment fees or other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. For any Same As Cash Credit Plan, credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) are not included in the Daily Balance of that Credit Plan during the promotional period. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(f) The Daily Periodic Rate for the Standard Rate will be .05918% (corresponding 21.6% Annual Percentage Rate). The Daily Periodic Rate for the Penalty Rate will be .07014% (corresponding 25.6% Annual Percentage Rate). Your APR may increase to the Penalty APR if we fail to receive your minimum payment with in 60 days when due. You will no longer be eligible for the Standard Rate and all existing Promotional Credit Plans will terminate, and your entire Account balance will be subject to the Penalty Rate. If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the new Penalty APR goes into effect.  If you make the next six consecutive on time minimum payments starting with your first payment due once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APR(s) applicable to your Account.  If you do not make these six consecutive on time minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.
8. MINIMUM Interest CHARGE: A minimum Interest Charge of $2.00  will be assessed for each billing cycle in which an Interest Charge is payable.
9. FEES: We may impose on your Account the following fees, which will be added to your Account when assessed:
a)	Late Payment Fee: A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
	The amount of the Late Payment Fee is shown in the chart below.  In no event will your Late Payment Fee exceed the amount of your Minimum Payment Due.
Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - Up to and including $100
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $19
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $19

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $100 and up to and including $500
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $29

Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $35

b)	Returned Payment Fee: A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
	Your Returned Payment Fee is $25.
	In no event will your Returned Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
c)	Research Fees: A Research Fee may be assessed to the Account for each copy of a requested document. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such copies are requested.
d)	Reissued Card Fee: You may be charged $5 each time you request that your credit card be reissued.
e)	Payment by Phone Fee: A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment is requested.
f)	Over the Credit Limit Fee: In the event you exceed your credit limit, you will be charged an Over the Credit Limit Fee of $0.
g)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
10. INSURANCE: If available and you elect any credit insurance coverage, you authorize us to charge the insurance premium for such insurance to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the insurance premium is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the premium is being assessed. Credit insurance charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
11. DEBT CANCELLATION: If available and you elect debt cancellation, you authorize us to charge the fee for such debt cancellation to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the debt cancellation fee is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the fee is being assessed. Debt cancellation charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
12. MINIMUM PAYMENT: You agree to pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due. Your Minimum Payment due is equal to your Minimum Payment plus the Special Repayment Factor for any Promotional Credit Plans with a special repayment factor plus any debt cancellation fees or credit insurance premiums attributable to any Reduced Rate/Special Repayment Factor Credit plans plus any delinquent amounts. The Minimum Payment is the greater of a.) $25 or b.) 1% of your “New Balance” (which does not include balances on Special Repayment Factor Credit Plans) plus billed Interest Charges plus any Late Fees assessed for that month, rounded to the next highest dollar. Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments, which may affect crediting of your payments.
13. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) not drawn in U.S. dollars on funds on deposit in the U.S.; (b) missing a signature; (c) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (d) restrictively endorsed; (e) postdated; (f) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (g) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to HSBC Retail Services, P.O. Box 5226, Carol Stream, IL 60197-5226. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
14. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances. If you have a Same As Cash Credit Plan(s), we will automatically apply payments received during the final two complete billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first to the required Minimum Payment Due and next to the plan(s) that is expiring, in the order of expiration; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0% APR for purposes of determining payment application.
15. CREDIT LIMIT: You agree not to let the Account balance exceed the credit limit established for you by us from time to time. We do not have to honor any use of your Card or honor credit card checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit, but if we do, you agree to repay the amount by which your credit limit is exceeded, plus Interest Charges immediately.
16. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of any merchant to accept or honor the Card or a credit card check.
17. SECURITY: Except as indicated below, you grant us a purchase money security interest in the goods purchased with your Card and in all insurance contracts and all proceeds, returned premiums, mechanical failure and extended service contracts, and refunds of charges for mechanical failure and extended service contracts financed therewith. Each good purchased on your Account will secure the entire Account balance until such good is paid in full. For purposes of determining which goods are subject to a security interest, payments received will be deemed to be applied first to any unpaid insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable), Interest Charges and fees and then to pay for purchases on the Account in the order in which they were made. When sufficient payments are made to repay the portion of the Account balance attributable to the purchase of a particular good, we will release our purchase money security interest in that good. Goods covered by a security interest may be taken from you if you do not pay on time. We may require you to make them available at a convenient place of our choice. We take no security interest in goods where the original purchase price is less than $200 if you live in New York and in goods where the original purchase price is less than $700 if you live in Maryland. If we repossess any goods purchased with your Card, we may charge you our repossession cost including, but not limited to, necessary repairs, storage fees and costs of sale, when and as permitted by law.
18. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your moving out of the U.S. or Canada or providing us with a non-U.S. or non-Canadian mailing address; (l) your becoming incompetent; (m) your exceeding your credit limit; (n) your payment being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (o) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (p) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.

The parties shall bear the expense of their respective attorney's fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, or the fees paid to the Administrator, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein. If the arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the Administrator or for which we are responsible.
Covered Persons
This arbitration provision covers Claims by or against (a) us, any corporate parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, any predecessor or successor of the foregoing, and any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of any of the aforementioned, (b) you and any authorized user, and any other person claiming through you or any authorized user, and (c) any other person assisting us in offering Cards, administering Accounts or providing Card related benefits or services (“Covered Persons”). If a Claim that is within the scope of the first paragraph of the “Claims and Arbitration Administrators” paragraph above is advanced by or against any third person, and any of the persons mentioned in the previous sentence is involved as a party, then the entire Claim is subject to arbitration under this Agreement, including any Claim by or against any third person.
Protection of Information
The rules and procedures of the Administrator, which you may obtain from that organization, shall govern the arbitration unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will control. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, nor to state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. If you or we request, the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized under applicable law and will use best efforts to protect confidential information (including through use of protective orders).
Parties to Arbitration
Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.” The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver. You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules. In the event of such an appeal, an appeal panel consisting of three arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The panel's decision will be final and binding. Any final decision of the arbitrator or of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as provided under the FAA. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the FAA by any court having jurisdiction.
Consequences of Electing Arbitration
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY EITHER PARTY.

Terms and Conditions
How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called ""average daily balance (including new purchases)"".
Billing Rights: Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided in this Cardholder Agreement.
You may pay the entire New Balance on your Account at any time.
CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
1. GENERAL: Each person signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application for a credit card account (“Account”) as applicant or joint applicant applies for an Account with HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., a national banking association, and requests one or more credit card(s) bearing the name or tradename of Roomstore to be used in connection with the Account. The word “Card” means any credit card(s) issued to you or an authorized user of your Account. In this Agreement, the words “you” and “your” refer to the applicant and joint applicant named on the credit card application and the words “we”, “us” and “our” refer to HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., located at 1111 Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144. If based on your creditworthiness, we determine you do not qualify for the Basic Program, you agree we may consider you for an account with the terms and conditions of the Alternate Program. If approved for the Alternate Program, you agree to its terms and conditions.
If your application is approved, “applicant” will be referred to as “primary cardholder” and “joint applicant” will be referred to as “secondary cardholder” for purposes of this agreement.
If we accept your application to open an Account, you agree that you will only purchase goods and services for personal, family and household purposes from merchants which honor the Card.
2. ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT: By a) signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application, using or permitting others to use the Card, b) signing or permitting others to sign sales slips; or c) making or permitting others to make purchases by telephone, Internet, or any other means, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Cardholder Agreement and Disclosure Statement, which includes an arbitration provision.
3. PROMISE TO PAY: You agree to pay all amounts charged to the Account, whether incurred by you or anyone you authorize or permit to use your Account or Card. If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.
4. ABILITY TO REPAY: When you use the Account or permit others to use the Account, you represent that you have the ability and intention to repay all amounts charged to the Account.
5. BILLING STATEMENT: We will send you a billing statement monthly for each billing cycle at the end of which you have a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00, or in which an Interest Charge has been imposed. The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other charges or fees, including credit insurance or debt cancellation (if applicable), and all payments and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle. The billing statement will show the amount owed on your Account. The total Amount owed is called “New Balance” on your billing statement subject to the terms of Promotional Credit Plan purchases, if any, as indicated below.
6. PROMOTIONAL CREDIT PLANS: The following Promotional Credit Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase: a) Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan – no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase for a specified period, as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; b) Same As Cash/Monthly Payment Credit Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase before the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, Interest Charges will be imposed from the purchase date; c) Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; d) Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan – A special repayment factor will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; e) Special Repayment Factor/Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A special repayment factor and a reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle.  All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Credit Plan are referred to as Regular Credit Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Card. Call 1-888-367-4310 or review the Application of Payments section of this Agreement for information.
7. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(iv) a purchase on a Same As Cash Credit Plan if the full cash sales price is paid in full before the promotion expiration date.
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan other than a Same As Cash Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Same As Cash Credit Plan during a cycle, the amount will be the sum of the following daily Interest Charge calculations for the Credit Plan during the current cycle and during each of the prior billing cycles (each a “Prior Cycle”) from the transaction date of the purchase through the current cycle: (i) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for the Current Cycle times the Daily Balance for each day in the current cycle; and (ii) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for each Prior Cycle times the Daily Balances of the Credit Plan for each day during each Prior Cycle.
(e) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) incurred on that day and 4) any late fees, over the credit limit fees, returned payment fees or other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. For any Same As Cash Credit Plan, credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) are not included in the Daily Balance of that Credit Plan during the promotional period. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(f) The Daily Periodic Rate for the Standard Rate will be .07370% (corresponding 26.9% Annual Percentage Rate). The Daily Periodic Rate for the Penalty Rate will be .08192% (corresponding 29.9% Annual Percentage Rate). Your APR may increase to the Penalty APR if we fail to receive your minimum payment with in 60 days when due. You will no longer be eligible for the Standard Rate and all existing Promotional Credit Plans will terminate, and your entire Account balance will be subject to the Penalty Rate. If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the new Penalty APR goes into effect.  If you make the next six consecutive on time minimum payments starting with your first payment due once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APR(s) applicable to your Account.  If you do not make these six consecutive on time minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.
8. MINIMUM Interest CHARGE: A minimum Interest Charge of $2.00 will be assessed for each billing cycle in which an Interest Charge is payable.
9. FEES: We may impose on your Account the following fees, which will be added to your Account when assessed:
a)	Late Payment Fee: A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
	The amount of the Late Payment Fee is shown in the chart below.  In no event will your Late Payment Fee exceed the amount of your Minimum Payment Due.

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - Up to and including $100
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $25

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $100
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $35
b)	Returned Payment Fee: A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
	Your Returned Payment Fee is $25.
	In no event will your Returned Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
c)	Research Fees: A Research Fee may be assessed to the Account for each copy of a requested document. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such copies are requested.
d)	Reissued Card Fee: You may be charged $5 each time you request that your credit card be reissued.
e)	Payment by Phone Fee: A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment is requested.
f)	Over the Credit Limit Fee: In the event you exceed your credit limit, you will be charged an Over the Credit Limit Fee of $0.
g)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
10. INSURANCE: If available and you elect any credit insurance coverage, you authorize us to charge the insurance premium for such insurance to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the insurance premium is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the premium is being assessed. Credit insurance charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
11. DEBT CANCELLATION: If available and you elect debt cancellation, you authorize us to charge the fee for such debt cancellation to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the debt cancellation fee is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the fee is being assessed. Debt cancellation charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
12. MINIMUM PAYMENT: You agree to pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due. To obtain your Minimum Payment Due, we add the following amounts (1+2+3):
1) Any delinquent amount you owe us from a previous cycle;
2) the greater of
a.) 4% of your “Minimum Payment Balance” (which is your “New Balance”less balances on Special Repayment Factor Credit Plans)
or
b.) 1% of your Minimum Payment Balance; plus current billed Interest Charges and current Late Fees, plus the Special Repayment Factors for any Promotional Credit Plans with Special Repayment Factors, rounded to the next highest dollar. If this amount is less than $40, we will use $40.
3) any debt cancellation fees or credit insurance premiums attributable to Promotional Credit Plans with Reduced Rate/Special Repayment Factors. Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments, which may affect crediting of your payments.
13. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) not drawn in U.S. dollars on funds on deposit in the U.S.; (b) missing a signature; (c) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (d) restrictively endorsed; (e) postdated; (f) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (g) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to HSBC Retail Services, P.O. Box 5226, Carol Stream, IL 60197-5226. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
14. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances. If you have a Same As Cash Credit Plan(s), we will automatically apply payments received during the final two complete billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first to the required Minimum Payment Due and next to the plan(s) that is expiring, in the order of expiration; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0% APR for purposes of determining payment application.
15. CREDIT LIMIT: You agree not to let the Account balance exceed the credit limit established for you by us from time to time. We do not have to honor any use of your Card or honor credit card checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit, but if we do, you agree to repay the amount by which your credit limit is exceeded, plus Interest Charges immediately.
16. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of any merchant to accept or honor the Card or a credit card check.
17. SECURITY: Except as indicated below, you grant us a purchase money security interest in the goods purchased with your Card and in all insurance contracts and all proceeds, returned premiums, mechanical failure and extended service contracts, and refunds of charges for mechanical failure and extended service contracts financed therewith. Each good purchased on your Account will secure the entire Account balance until such good is paid in full. For purposes of determining which goods are subject to a security interest, payments received will be deemed to be applied first to any unpaid insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable), Interest Charges and fees and then to pay for purchases on the Account in the order in which they were made. When sufficient payments are made to repay the portion of the Account balance attributable to the purchase of a particular good, we will release our purchase money security interest in that good. Goods covered by a security interest may be taken from you if you do not pay on time. We may require you to make them available at a convenient place of our choice. We take no security interest in goods where the original purchase price is less than $200 if you live in New York and in goods where the original purchase price is less than $700 if you live in Maryland. If we repossess any goods purchased with your Card, we may charge you our repossession cost including, but not limited to, necessary repairs, storage fees and costs of sale, when and as permitted by law.
18. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Total Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your moving out of the U.S. or Canada or providing us with a non-U.S. or non-Canadian mailing address; (l) your becoming incompetent; (m) your exceeding your credit limit; (n) your payment being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (o) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (p) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.
19. ARBITRATION: 
Federal Arbitration Act
This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1 - 16 (the ""FAA""). The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and provide written reasoned findings of fact and conclusions of law upon written request as set forth in the applicable arbitration association procedures. The arbitrator's award shall not be subject to appeal except as permitted by the FAA. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

The party initiating the arbitration proceeding shall have the right to select one of the following Administrators: Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) or the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). The arbitrator shall be a lawyer with more than ten years experience or a retired or former judge.

Our address for service of process under this provision is HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., P.O. Box 98740, Las Vegas, NV 89193-8740.
Small Claims Exemption
We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim you may bring in small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration at such time.
Location of Arbitration and Fees
Any participatory arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient to you. On any Claim you file, you will pay the first $50 of the filing fee. At your request we will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the Administrator on any Claim submitted by you in arbitration up to a maximum of $1,500. If you are required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, we will consider a request by you to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, we shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees unless the arbitrator grants you an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in your favor, we will reimburse you for any additional fees paid or owed by you to the Administrator up to the amount of the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual award in your favor. The parties shall bear the expense of their respective attorney's fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, or the fees paid to the Administrator, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein. If the arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the Administrator or for which we are responsible.
Covered Persons
This arbitration provision covers Claims by or against (a) us, any corporate parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, any predecessor or successor of the foregoing, and any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of any of the aforementioned, (b) you and any authorized user, and any other person claiming through you or any authorized user, and (c) any other person assisting us in offering Cards, administering Accounts or providing Card related benefits or services (“Covered Persons”). If a Claim that is within the scope of the first paragraph of the “Claims and Arbitration Administrators” paragraph above is advanced by or against any third person, and any of the persons mentioned in the previous sentence is involved as a party, then the entire Claim is subject to arbitration under this Agreement, including any Claim by or against any third person.
Protection of Information
The rules and procedures of the Administrator, which you may obtain from that organization, shall govern the arbitration unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will control. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, nor to state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. If you or we request, the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized under applicable law and will use best efforts to protect confidential information (including through use of protective orders).
Parties to Arbitration
Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.” 
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver. You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules. In the event of such an appeal, an appeal panel consisting of three arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The panel's decision will be final and binding. Any final decision of the arbitrator or of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as provided under the FAA. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the FAA by any court having jurisdiction.
Consequences of Electing Arbitration
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY EITHER PARTY.

(i) ACCOUNT 

This is the Agreement that covers your Banco Popular North America MasterCard credit card account 
(called your �Account�) with us. In this Agreement, and in your monthly statements (each, an 
�Account Statement�), the words �you� and �your� refer to all persons named on the credit card 
application, credit card, or acceptance form, as well as their heirs and executors, and the words �we�, 
�us� and �our� and �Bank �refer to Banco Popular North America . 


 

You can use your credit card (�Card�) to purchase goods and services at participating merchants and 
to take cash advances as described in this Agreement. You agree not to use your Card for any 
unlawful purpose. If you use, or allow someone else to use, any Card associated with your Account 
for any other purpose, you will be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us and 
MasterCard� International Incorporated (�MasterCard�) for all amounts or expenses either Banco 
Popular North America or MasterCard pays as a result of such use. 

 

(ii) PROMISE TO PAY 

You promise to pay for (a) credit extended by Banco Popular North America, to you or to anyone 
whom you permit to use any Card associated with your Account; (b)INTEREST CHARGES, late 
charges, and any other fees or administrative charges (e.g., returned check charges) provided in this 
Agreement; and (c) collection costs and attorneys' fees as permitted by applicable law if your Account 
should go into default. 

 

(iii) CASH ADVANCES 

The term �Cash Advance� includes the following transactions: (1) Automated Teller Machine (ATM) 
transactions; (2) convenience check transactions; (3) money orders, cashiers checks, traveler 
checks, wire transfers, foreign currency or other in-bank transactions; (4) tax payments; (5) certain 
permitted gambling transactions; and (6) court costs, bail bonds and fines. Convenience checks are 
used the same as personal checks and are drawn from your Account and billed on your monthly 
Account Statement. 

 

(iv) CREDIT LIMIT 

You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the Purchases and 
cash advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon receipt 
of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each monthly Account 
Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit 
limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you 
exceed your authorized credit limit, the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return 
or forfeit the Card and close the Account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, 
shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized 
credit limit. 

 

(v) INTEREST CHARGES 

Monthly INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on all Balances on this Account. The INTEREST 
CHARGE applied to purchases and balance transfers from other institutions will be based on variable 
Annual Percentage Rates (�APR�). This APR can increase or decrease for each billing period. Different 
APRs can apply to purchases, Cash Advances, balance transfers from other institutions, and 
convenience checks. Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for specific APRs related to your 
Account. 

Variable APRs will be determined by adding the United States Prime Rate as published in The Wall 
Street Journal (�Prime Rate�) to a margin. There is no pre-set limit on rate increases. The amount of 
your margins and current APRs are disclosed in the accompanying card mailer. We determine the 
margins applicable to your Account based on your credit history at the time of approval of your Card 
application. An increase in the Prime Rate will cause an increase in your APR, the INTEREST CHARGE 
and your minimum payment. 

The �Daily Periodic Rate� is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances and is determined 
by dividing the APR by 365 and rounding up. For each billing period, the APR will be based on the 
Prime Rate published two business days prior to the Account Statement/closing date for that billing 
period. In the event the Prime Rate is not available as of that date, we may substitute a similar 
published rate that is outside of our control. To the extent permitted by law, any change in your APR 
will apply to the existing balance on your Account and to new transactions. 

The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances. The INTEREST 
CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the 
number of days in the billing period. 

The Average Daily Balance for purchases is obtained by taking into account the initial daily balance on 
purchases, plus any new purchases, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on purchases, and any 
other fees and charges that we add that day, minus any payments and credits we apply to the 
purchase balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the 
total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. New purchases are added to the daily 
balance on posting date, unless we elect to use a later date. Purchases will begin to accrue INTEREST 
CHARGES on the date of posting. No INTEREST CHARGE will be imposed on a purchase added to your 
daily balance during the billing cycle covered by the Account Statement if that Account Statement 
shows no previous balance or shows that the previous balance was paid in full by its payment due 
date. Also, no additional INTEREST CHARGE will be charged on any Purchases included in the new 
balance of a monthly periodic statement if you pay the new balance in full on or before the date 
specified in your statement. The payment due date will be 25 days or more, depending upon the 
payment due date on your Account. 

The Average Daily Balance for Cash Advances is obtained by taking into account the initial daily 
balance on Cash Advances, plus any new Cash Advances, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on 
Cash Advances, and any other Cash Advance fees that we add that day, minus any payments and 
credits we apply to the Cash Advance balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing 
period are added and the total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. The INTEREST 


CHARGE on Cash Advances, balance transfers and convenience checks will be imposed from the date 
the transaction is conducted. There is no �free ride� period for such transactions. 

Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for other terms which are made a part of this 
Agreement. 

 

(vi) ANNUAL FEE 

If applicable, the annual fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is 
issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the first Card. Please refer to the 
accompanying card mailer for specific annual fee information related to your Account. 

 

(vii) MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 

We will not impose any late charges or penalty fees if you pay at least the minimum payment 
reflected on your statement by the specified �Payment Due� date. If you wish, you may pay more 
than the minimum payment and at any time you may pay the entire amount due for the current 
billing cycle. Send payments to Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 
2938, Milwaukee, WI 53201-2938. 

 

Your payment will be credited as of the day we receive it, subject to any applicable cutoff hour. The 
new cutoff time for payments received by mail, telephone and other electronic means is 5:00 p.m. 
Central Time. We offer the convenience of online payments. Please visit www.mypopularcards.com to 
set up an account and avail of this free online payment service. Payments received by 5:00 pm CST, 
Monday through Friday, will be processed the same day. Online payments received on Saturday, 
Sunday or a Bank holiday will be processed the next business day. If the payment is made at a Bank 
branch during business hours in cash or with a check drawn against the Bank, it will be processed the 
same day. Credit for any other payments may be delayed five (5) business days during which interest 
will not accrue. If your payment due date falls on a weekend or legal federal holiday, the payment 
received will be credited to the account on the next business day and will not be considered late. If your 
payment is received after the payment cutoff time on the due date or any time thereafter, a late 
payment fee will be charged to your Account. Please refer to the back of your cardmailer for more 
details regarding the minimum monthly payment and other important terms applicable to your Account. 

 

(viii) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS 

If you pay the required minimum payment of the monthly Account Statement, the payment shall be 
applied in the following way: first to INTEREST CHARGES and the rest shall be applied first to the 
debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances, with the lowest APR and then to the debt with the 
higher APR in ascending order. Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until 
the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required 
payment, the excess shall be applied first to the debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances 
with the highest APR and then to the debt with the lowest APR in descending order. 

 

All payments by mail must be made by check or money order. Payments may not be made by 
attempting to effect a transfer or by using a convenience check from this Account or from any other 
Banco Popular North America credit card account. You agree that any payment you make may be, 
but is not required to be, returned to you without applying it to your Account and without 
presentment or protest, for reasons including, but not limited to, that the check or money order: (1) 
is missing a signature; (2) is drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (3) contains a 
restrictive endorsement; (4) is post dated; (5) is not payable to Banco Popular North America; (6) is 
not payable in U.S. dollars; (7) is not paid upon presentment; or (8) results from an attempted 
transfer or is drawn on a convenience check. You agree to pay any Bank collection fees we incur for 
any check payments made in U.S. dollars drawn on a financial institution not located in the United 
States. All payments made by mail under this Agreement must be received at the address specified 
on your Account Statement. 

 

Any conditional check, money order or any other instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a 
disputed debt or as an accord and satisfaction or containing a restrictive endorsement must be sent 
to us at the Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 2938, Milwaukee, 
WI 53201-2938. You must note conspicuously on the face of the payment that it is tendered for this 
purpose. If you make a payment in any other manner and we accept it, we will not have waived our 
rights to collect any amounts owed under this Agreement. Even though your payment may be posted 
to your Account, we may not restore your available credit or Cash Advance available credit 
immediately. 

 

(ix) MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENT 

The Bank shall mail to you a monthly Account Statement at the end of each billing period in which 
you have a balance in excess of $1. You must notify the Bank, in writing, of any error in the Account 
Statement, within sixty (60) days, following the date on which the Account Statement was mailed. 

 

(x) FEES 

Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

a. Penalty fee: A late fee will be added to the standard purchase balance for each billing period you 
fail to pay by its due date the Minimum Payment Due. Returned payment fees may also be charged. 

 

b. Currency conversion fee: If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, other than a cash 
advance made at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, MasterCard will convert the charge into a U.S. 
dollar amount. MasterCard currently uses a conversion rate in effect one day prior to its transaction 
processing date. Such rate is either a wholesale market rate or the government-mandated rate. 
Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

 


If you make a Cash Advance in a foreign currency at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, the 
amount is converted into U.S. dollars by our affiliate in accordance with its foreign currency 
conversion procedures then in effect. Our affiliate currently uses a conversion rate in effect on its 
applicable processing date. Such rate is either a mid-point market rate or the government-mandated 
rate. 

 

The foreign currency conversion rate in effect on the applicable processing date for a transaction may 
differ from the rate in effect on the sale or post date on your Account Statement for that transaction. 

 

If a transaction is converted by a third party prior to such transaction being processed by MasterCard, 
the foreign currency conversion rate for that transaction will be the rate selected by that third party. 

 

c. Administrative charges: We may charge you a fee to take advantage of certain optional 
administrative services we provide our Cardmembers such as copy of Account Statements, additional 
credit cards or express delivery services. Each time an administrative service is offered to you, any 
fee for the service will be reflected on your Account Statement. You agree to pay the fee disclosed 
each time you opt to take advantage of an administrative service. These services are optional and are 
not required to be used by you.

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Account Statement 

If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, write to us at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

In your letter, give us the following information: 

� Account information: Your name and account number. 
� Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
� Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, describe what 
you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. 


 

You must contact us: 

� Within 60 days after the error appeared on your Account Statement. 
� At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment 
on the amount you think is wrong. 


 

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not 
required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 

 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 

When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 

1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also 
tell you if we have already corrected the error. 

2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we 
believe the Account Statement is correct. 

 

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 

� We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
� The charge in question may remain on your Account Statement, and we may continue to impose 
INTEREST CHARGES on that amount. 
� While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your 
balance. 
� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 


 

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 


� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any INTEREST CHARGES 
or other fees related to that amount. 
� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with 
applicable INTEREST CHARGES and fees. We will send you an Account Statement of the amount 
you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the 
amount we think you owe. 


 

If you receive our explanation but still believe your Account Statement is wrong, you must write to us 
within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent 
without also reporting that you are questioning your Account Statement . We must tell you the name 
of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when 
the matter has been settled between us. 

 

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you 
question even if your Account Statement is correct. 

 

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Card Purchases 

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your Card and you 
have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay 
the remaining amount due on the purchase. 

 

To use this right, all of the following must be true: 

1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing 
address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. 

(Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to 
you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 

2. You must have used your Card for the purchase. Purchases made with Cash Advances from an ATM 
or with a check that accesses your Card account do not qualify. 

3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 

 

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in 
writing at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we 
finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount 
and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

grossly negligent, you will have no liability for unauthorized purchases

to anyone unless we are required by law to do so.
22. Waivers. If, for any reason, we do not make use of any of our rights
under this Agreement on a particular occasion, that will not limit our
rights in the future in any way.
23. Important Notice to Our Members Who Contact Us by Phone.
Cardholder agrees that Issuer, it�s agents and service companies may,
without the need to seek additional confirmation from Cardholder,
monitor and/or record any telephone communications with Cardholder
to insure that inquires from you are handled promptly, courteously, and
accurately.
24. Visa Rules and Regulation. The services being provided to you
under this Agreement are made possible by Issuer�s status as a licensee
of Visa U.S.A. You recognize Issuers responsibility to comply with the
current Visa U.S.A. rules and regulations and changes to them in order to
continue to provide these services. VISA cards may not be used for any
illegal transaction.
25. Severability. If for any reason one or more of the provisions in this
Agreement is declared unenforceable and/or void, the rest of the
provisions in the Agreement continue to apply as if the unenforceable or
void provision did not appear in the Agreement.
26. Illegal Use. You agree not to make or permit to be made any illegal
transactions on your Account through the use of a Card, a check or in any
other manner. We may deny authorization for any internet gambling
transactions.
Regulation Z Initial Disclosures. By using your card, you
acknowledge receipt from us of the Initial Disclosures required by
Regulation Z of the Truth-In-Lending Act and that the terms contained
in the Initial Disclosures apply to you and your use of the card and are
incorporated in full into this Agreement. The information about the terms
and costs of the Card described in this Member Agreement is accurate
as of the Effective Date. This information may have changed after that

ELGA Credit Union
2303 S. Center Rd.
Burton, MI 48519
Phone: 810-715-3542
� 2009 CUcorp, Incorporated (800.435.2824) 00020303-1147
If you are unable to recover and return the card, you will continue to be
liable for any charges made unless you tell us to cancel all cards and
establish a new account for you, which will be done automatically if you
notify us of unauthorized use under Paragraph 21 of this Agreement.
We may request written verification from you regarding any change or
cancellation to your account.
5. U.S. Currency. If you make a purchase or cash advance in foreign
currency the transaction will be converted into U.S. Dollars by Visa. To
the extent that you have used your Visa card to purchase goods or
services, or obtain cash in another country, your statement may reflect
the conversion into U.S. Dollars of transactions which occurred, initially,
in a different currency. The exchange rate applied to such transactions
is a (i) wholesale market rate or (ii) government-mandated rate in effect
one day prior to the processing date, increased by one percent.
6. Your Credit Limit. Your credit limit is shown on each of your billing
statements. You agree not to use your account in any way that will cause
your balance to go over your limit. If you do, we may at our option, close
your account, and/or exercise any of our other remedies under this
Agreement or at law. You must pay the full amount of your balance which
is over the credit limit. The fact that we do not ask you for that amount
as part of the Minimum Periodic Payment shown on your billing
statement does not relieve you of your obligation to pay it immediately.
We will not authorize any new Credit Purchases or Cash Advances if
your records show that doing so will cause your balance to go over your
limit. If we do authorize any such Credit Purchase or Cash Advance,
such authorization will not result in any waiver of our rights under this
section. If we increase your credit limit, we will notify you.
7. Law Governing This Agreement. To the extent not expressly
prohibited by applicable law, this agreement and your account, as well
as our rights and duties and your rights and duties regarding this
agreement and your account, will be governed by and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of the Sate of Michigan and the United
States, regardless of where you may reside or use your account at any
time. The choice of law is made because of a strong relationship
between this Agreement and your account to ELGA Credit Union,
because Issuer is located in Michigan, and to insure uniform
procedures and interpretation for all of our members, no matter where
they reside or use their accounts. If any term or provision of this
Agreement is found to be unenforceable, this will not make any other
terms or provision unenforceable.
8. Honoring Your Card. We will not have any responsibility to you if
anyone refuses to honor a Card issued on your account. Any refund,
adjustment or credit allowed by a Seller shall not be by cash but
rather by a credit advise to us, which will be shown as a credit on
your account statement.
9. Security for This Account. You agree to give ELGA Credit Union
security interest in any and all collateral that you have pledged
with ELGA Credit Union to secure any and all debts now and
hereafter owed ELGA Credit Union, including all debts incurred by
credit card and overdrafts except this collateral shall not secure
any loan from ELGA Credit Union that is secured by your principal
residence. You also agree that any and all shares and deposits in
your individual and joint accounts with ELGA Credit Union are
pledged as collateral if you default on your credit card debt now
and in the future.
10. Payment Period. You will receive monthly billing statements from
us. The New Balance shown on your statement is the total of unpaid
obligations, which have been posted to your account as of the statement
date. You can either pay the entire New Balance or you can pay in
installments, but we must receive at least the Minimum Periodic
Payment shown on your billing statement by the payment due date. If
you make extra payments or larger payments, you still are required to
make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a
balance (other than a credit balance). The Minimum Periodic Payment is
figured as follows:
11. Payment Applications. Subject to applicable law, your payments
may be applied to what you owe ELGA Credit Union in any manner the
Credit Union chooses in it�s sole discretion.
12. Immediate Repayment of Your Full Balance. You will be in default,
and we may, without notifying you, temporarily suspend your credit,
close your account, cancel all credit cards issued on it and require
immediate payment of your entire balance if any of the following occurs:
a. You fail to make a payment when it is due;
b. You do not follow the terms of this agreement in any way;
c. You have made any false or misleading statement on the
application for your account;
d. You fail to pay any other loans you owe us;
e. You become insolvent or die;
f. There is an attachment, execution or levy against your
property or you make an assignment for the benefit of
creditors;
g. A bankruptcy petition is filed by or against you;
h. A guardian, conservator, receiver, custodian or trustee is
appointed for you;
i. You are generally not paying your debts as they become
due; or
j. There has been a material adverse change in your financial
standing.
13. Reevaluation of Credit. We can reinvestigate and reevaluate any
information you provided on your credit application at any time, and in
the course of doing so, we may ask you additional information, request
credit bureau reports and/or otherwise verify your current credit
standing.
14. Periodic FINANCE CHARGE. Your account will be subject to the
Monthly Periodic FINANCE CHARGE Rate and corresponding Annual
Percentage Rate applicable to the ELGA Credit Union accounts, set
forth in the Initial Disclosure provided to you by us. If you pay your
minimum monthly payment 30 days late, your rate will adjust to
the highest ELGA Credit Union Annual Percentage Rate which is
currently 17.90%.
You have a 25 day grace (no finance charge) period on your purchase
balance and for new purchases if you paid the Total New Balance for
purchases on your last statement by the end of the grace period. You
also have a 25 day grace period for new purchases if you did not have
a purchase balance on your last statement. The grace period starts on
the statement closing date. If you do not pay the Total New Balance for
purchases by the end of the grace period, finance charges will be
imposed on the unpaid purchase balance from the first day of the next
billing cycle and on new purchases from the date they are posted to
your Account. Finance charge is imposed on cash advances from the
date they are posted to your account.
We figure [a portion of] the finance charge on your account by applying
the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your account
(including current transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we
take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new
[purchases/advances/loans], and subtract any payments or credits,
[and unpaid finance charges]. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we
add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by
the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the �average daily
balance.�
15. Other Charges.
Late Charge - If we do not receive your minimum required payment
within 15 days after the closing date subsequent to the payment due
date indicated on your billing statement, we will impose a late fee of
$20.00.
Replacement Card - We reserve the right to charge you $5.00 to replace
a card.
Document Copy Fee - There will be a $5.00 Sales Draft copy fee for
each copy you request.
Non-Sufficient Funds - If any check used to make a payment on your
account is returned for non-sufficient funds, you will be charged a fee of
$20.00 for each such returned check.
Pick-Up Fee - When a card is lost and has been reported to the credit
union�s card processor a block is placed. If the card is recovered and
you try to use it, the merchant will capture the card and you will be
charged $75.00.
If Your New Balance is: Payment is:
$10.00 or less The amount of your new balance.
Over $10.00 3% of that portion of the New Balance
which does not exceed your credit limit,
plus the entire portion of the New
Balance in excess of your credit limit,
plus any past due, or $10.00 whichever is
greater.

VISA PLATINUM AND VISA SECURED PLATINUM
CONSUMER CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT
 


 
In this Agreement, �Agreement� means this Consumer Credit Card Agreement. �Disclosure� means the Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement. 
1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will not allow advances over the credit limit. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. 
You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request.  
2. USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery tickets, and casino gaming chips, as applicable. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal. 
3. PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account. 
4. PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement.  
5. FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle. Finance charge begins to accrue on those purchases from the first day of the next billing cycle, unless you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle�s billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 
The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the purchase balance. (We do not add in any purchases posted during the billing cycle.) This gives us the daily balance of purchases. Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases.  
For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To get the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. Then, we add all the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances. 
6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date.  
A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
7. FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
a. Balance Transfer Fee. If your account is subject to a Balance Transfer Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you transfer a balance from an account of another creditor to the account subject to this Agreement. 
b. Cash Advance Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Cash Advance Fee (finance charge), the fee will be charged to your account when you obtain a cash advance from an ATM, the Credit Union or other financial institution.  
c. Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency.  
d. Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
e. Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when a payment is returned to you for any reason. 
8. PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 3.00% of your total new balance, or $18.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, and any amount you are over your credit limit. In addition to the minimum payment, you must also pay, by the date specified above, the amount of any prior minimum payment(s) that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit.  
9. PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate.  
10. SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount.  
Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default. 
 


Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement.  
11. DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. 
When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe. 
12. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION � You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at PO Box 840129, Houston, TX 77284-0129 or telephone 281-856-5300 or 800-456-FCCU seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00. 
13. CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT � As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. 
Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized. 
The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account.  
14. CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS � Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user. If you cannot return the authorized user's card or access checks and if you request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for a new account. 
15. CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION � You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing.

16. RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS � Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account.

This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may terminate the account and the termination will be effective as to all of you. 
20. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT � This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms. 
21. NO WAIVER � The Credit Union can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them. 
22. STATEMENTS AND NOTICES � Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the appropriate address you have given the Credit Union. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all.

24. COPY RECEIVED � You acknowledge that you have received a copy of this Agreement and Disclosure.

26. VOLUNTARY PAYMENT PROTECTION � We may offer Voluntary Payment Protection to you. Voluntary Payment Protection is not necessary to obtain credit. If you purchase Voluntary Payment Protection from us, you authorize us to add the fees or insurance charges monthly to your loan balance and charge you interest on the entire balance. At our option we will change your payment or the period of time necessary to repay the loan balance. The rate used to determine the fees or insurance charges may change in the future. If the rate changes, we will provide any notices required by applicable law.

If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at: 
First Community Credit Union of Houston 
PO Box 840129 
Houston, TX 77284-0129 
You may also contact us on the Web: FCCU.org 
In your letter, give us the following information: 
� Account information: Your name and account number. 

� Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 

� Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. 


You must contact us: 
� Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. 

� At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. 


You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 
When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 
 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 
 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.  
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 
� We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 

� The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. 

� While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. 

� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.  


After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 
� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. 

� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.  


If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. 
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct. 
Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases 
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. 
To use this right, all of the following must be true: 
 1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 
 2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 
 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing [or electronically] at: 
First Community Credit Union of Houston 
PO Box 840129 
Houston, TX 77284-0129 
FCCU.org 
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

Also, the Bank can at any time and without cause and without notice, revoke the right to use the Card. If a merchant or a financial institution where the Card is attempted to be used asks for the surrender of the Card, it must be surrendered immediately.

3.1: Purchases. The Card may be used to purchase or lease goods or services wherever the Card is honored.

Subject to your available Credit Limit, the Card may be used to obtain cash advances or make a quasi cash transaction from your Card Account (1) in person at the Bank or any participating financial institution or (2) at any ATM in the Bank network or any of the other participating ATM networks (the names of which are shown on the back of the Card), subject to the following limitation (certain ATMs may have other limits): the total dollar amount of such ATM cash advances plus all cash withdrawal electronic fund transfers made during any calendar day (from midnight to midnight) may not exceed $500 for each card issued with your Card Account number. Each cash advance or quasi cash transaction will create a charge to your Card Account.
3.2.1: Use of your Credit Card to withdraw cash from ATM�s located outside of the Unites States creates a cash advance from and charge to your Card Account even if you select withdrawal from checking or savings account or any other type of account.
3.3: Electronic Online Cash Advances: Subject to your available Credit Limit, the Card may be used to obtain electronic online cash advances from your Card Account. Based on risk, we reserve the right to limit electronic online cash advance access at the sole discretion of the Bank. Each electronic online cash advance will be treated as a cash advance subject to a Cash Advance Transaction Fee charged to your Card Account.
3.4: Balance Transfers. Subject to your available Credit Limit, you can request a balance transfer to your Card Account. You may not use a balance transfer to pay off any other accounts you have with the Bank. You may only make a balance transfer to accounts that list you as an account holder. Allow 4 to 6 weeks to process your balance transfer request, during which time you should continue to make payments to those accounts. You will not earn any rewards points or cash back on a balance transfer. 
3.5: Transfers. The Card may also be used at the ATMs described above to make electronic transfers to or from your checking account, savings account or other consumer asset account you may have at the Bank (subject to the Bank's rules, regulations and agreements governing such accounts, which you should have already received and which are incorporated herein). You may request copies of these materials by calling 1-866-749-7459. Transfers from your Card Account to your checking account, savings account or other consumer asset account will be treated as a cash advance subject to a Cash Advance Transaction Fee.
3.6: Credit Card Checks. For promotional purposes the Bank may provide a supply of Credit Card Checks to access your account. Use of the Credit Card Checks creates a cash advance from and charge to your Card Account. Each unused Check is the property of the Bank and must be returned to the Bank if the Bank so requests. Also, the Bank can, at any time and without cause and without notice, revoke the right to use the Credit Card Checks. You agree to waive any right you may have to stop payment on a Credit Card Check.
3.7: Internet Transactions: Your card is a Visa branded card, enrollment in the Verified by Visa program is required after 3 Internet purchases. In order to make transactions over the Internet merchants may request your Verified by Visa password to complete the transaction. If a password is not provided the merchant may deny the transaction. If the password is incorrect we may deny the transaction. By allowing another to use your Verified by Visa password you are authorizing the transaction on your account.
3.8: Internet Gambling Notice: Restricted transactions as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation GG are prohibited from being processed through this account or relationship. Restricted transactions generally include, but are not limited to, those in which credit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or drafts are knowingly accepted by gambling businesses in connection with the participation by others in unlawful Internet gambling. We have elected to not offer accounts to organizations that offer or sponsor Internet gambling. Commercial accounts receiving or processing Internet gambling transactions are subject to closure.

4.0: MONTHLY STATEMENTS: The Bank will send you (or one of you) a monthly statement summarizing each transaction on your Card Account during the preceding billing period. Your monthly statement will show the total amount you owe as of the end of the billing period, including any interest charges, fees, the minimum payment due and the payment due date, which date is at least 25 days from the monthly statement closing date. It also shows your current Credit Limit. The Bank will mail or deliver your monthly statement to only one address. Preservation of your rights under federal law regarding resolution of billing errors depends upon your timely recognition of potential errors, as explained in �Billing Rights Summary� notice at the end of this Agreement.

5.0: HOW THE NEW BALANCE IS DETERMINED: The total amount that you owe the Bank at the end of the current billing period appears as the �New Balance� on the monthly statement. The Outstanding Balance at the end of the previous billing period is called the �Previous Balance�. The New Balance is determined by taking the Previous Balance and (1) subtracting any payments and credits received by the Bank during the current billing period and then (2) adding any purchases, cash advances, quasi cash transactions, balance transfers, interest charges, fees, and other adjustments.

6.0: PAYMENTS: You promise to pay the Bank according to the terms of this Agreement the entire amount owing hereunder. You agree to make all payments in U.S. Dollars drawn on funds on deposit in the United States (however, the Bank may at its option choose to accept payments made in foreign currency or made by drawing on funds on deposit outside the United States, in which case you agree to pay all conversion fees and bank collection fees incurred by the Bank, which amounts will be treated as purchase items). Do not send cash payments.
6.1: Payment Due Date. The payment due date on your Account will be the same date each month and your payment will be due by 5:00 p.m. in the manner and location specified on your billing statement.
6.2: Amount of Minimum Payment. If the New Balance is less than $30, the minimum payment is the full amount of the New Balance. If the New Balance is $30 or more, the minimum payment is the total of two figures: the first is any past due amount; the second is the sum of the greater of $30 plus late fees, or the combined total of 2.5% of the New Balance plus interest charges and late fees. You shall make (and the Bank shall have received at the address designated on your monthly statement) on or before 5:00 p.m. on the due date the minimum payment shown on your monthly statement (or, at your option, any greater amount up to the Outstanding Balance). Receipt of your minimum payment at any address other than that designated on your monthly statement may create a delay in posting the minimum payment to your Card Account and may thereby result in a late fee and additional interest charges. Making only the minimum payment will increase the amount of interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance.
6.3: Application of Payments. The amount of payments credited to your Account during a billing period will be applied first to unpaid interest charges, then to any miscellaneous fees, then to the balance having the highest APR, and then to each successive balance bearing the next higher APR until the payment is exhausted.�Balances having the same APR will be paid beginning with the oldest balance first. Payment for more than the minimum payment amount (but not more than the Outstanding Balance) will be accepted as a single payment for that billing period; the amount in excess of the minimum payment will not be applied toward future payments due.
6.4: Acceptance of Partial or Nonconforming Payments. The Bank may accept late payments, partial payments or any payment marked with any kind of restrictive endorsement (such as �paid in full� or �in settlement�) without giving effect to the restrictive endorsement and without losing, waiving, or impairing any of the Bank's rights under this Agreement or under applicable law.
6.5: Delay of Available Credit: We credit payments to your account on the day we receive them however, we reserve the right, based on risk, to delay the available credit resulting from those payments.
6.6: Prepayment. You may repay all or any portion of the Outstanding Balance at any time without penalty.

7.0: DEFAULT: If the minimum payment is not received at the proper address on or before the payment due date, or if you fail to honor any other obligation under this Agreement, or if you die, file for bankruptcy, or become insolvent or generally unable to pay your debts, or if you have furnished false or misleading information on the Card Application, or if you are in default under any other obligations you may owe to the Bank, or if the Bank reasonably believes that you are unable or unwilling to honor all of your obligations under this Agreement, the Bank may declare the Outstanding Balance immediately due and payable, may close your Card Account, and recover the Card and all unused Credit Card Checks.

8.0: LEGAL ACTION AND COSTS: Without waiving the Dispute Resolution provisions of this Agreement, the Bank may take legal action (including collection action) against you and you agree to pay all collection costs whether or not awardable as court costs (including the cost of Bank staff) and reasonable attorney fees (including those of salaried Bank employees). If the Bank sues to collect and you win the lawsuit, the Bank will pay your court costs and reasonable attorney fees. Also, you agree that regardless of where you reside, the Bank may initiate legal action against you in the State of Texas and you hereby submit yourself to jurisdiction of the courts therein.

9.0: INTEREST CHARGES: The following interest charges will apply whether before or after default, judgment, or the closing of your Card Account.
9.1: Periodic Interest Charges on Purchases, Cash Advances, Quasi Cash Transactions and Balance Transfers. No periodic interest charge on purchases will be assessed if you have paid the total New Balance listed on the previous monthly statement in full by the payment due date (which is at least 25 days from the monthly statement closing date); otherwise, a periodic interest charge will be assessed on each purchase from the date of the purchase transaction. If during the previous billing cycle you paid in full by the payment due date, then in the current billing cycle you will have a grace period on the amount of any purchase balance in the current billing cycle that is paid by the payment due date, based on our payment allocation method. A periodic interest charge will be assessed on each cash advance, quasi cash transaction or balance transfer from the date of such transaction; there is no grace period within which such a transaction can be repaid without incurring an interest charge.
9.2: Periodic Interest Charge Calculation(s). The total amount of interest charge for a billing period will be calculated as follows (interest charges on purchases and interest charges on cash advances, quasi cash transactions and balance transfers are calculated separately and then the resulting amounts combined to arrive at the total interest charges for the billing period): (1) We first determine the �average daily balance� of your account (including new transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases (or cash advances, quasi cash transactions or balance transfers) and then subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance (any unpaid interest charges incurred during that billing period are not included in the daily balance). Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the average daily balance, which is also called the �balance subject to interest charge� on your monthly statement; (2) We multiply the balance subject to interest charge by the number of days in the billing period; the resulting number is then multiplied by the daily periodic rate to determine the amount of interest charge.

10.0: ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE:
10.1: Daily Periodic Rate (DPR) and APR for Purchases. The DPR will be 1/365 (1/366 for a leap year) of the then current APR. The APR which is calculated on the average daily balance is a variable rate (subject to limits set by statute).The APR in effect throughout a particular billing period will be: 
* 3.50% for Private Banking Visa Platinum 
* 5.50% for Visa Platinum
* 7.00% for Visa Classic
* 7.50% for Student Visa Classic
* 9.00% for Visa Secured Classic
plus the PRIME RATE (as defined below) in effect on the day that precedes by 6 business days the first calendar day of the calendar month in which that billing period ends. The APR and DPR in effect for each billing period are disclosed on the corresponding monthly statement. 

The applied Index for the following as of 08/22/2010 is 3.25%.

10.2: DPR for Purchases: The DPR for transactions posting as Purchases is equal to its corresponding APR. To determine your rate we add the Index to the applicable margin as follows:

* 7.00% resulting in a DPR of 0.028082 (corresponding APR of 10.25%)
* 7.50% resulting in a DPR of 0.029452 (corresponding APR of 10.75%)

10.3: APR for Cash Advances, Quasi Cash Transactions and Balance Transfers: The APR in effect throughout a particular billing period for cash advances, quasi cash transactions and balance transfers will be 10.00% plus the Prime Rate.
10.4: DPR for Cash Advances, Quasi Cash Transactions and Balance Transfers: The DPR for transactions posting as a cash advance, quasi cash transactions or balance transfer is equal to its corresponding APR. To determine the rate, we add the Index to a margin of 10.00% resulting in a DPR of 0.036301 (corresponding APR of 13.25%).
10.5: Effect of Change in Rate. All other factors being equal, and subject to the method by which the minimum payment is calculated (as described above), an increase in the APR will increase the minimum payment, and a decrease in the APR will decrease the minimum payment
10.6: Prime Rate: The interest rate on your account is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an independent index which is the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal (the �Index�). If a range of rates has been published, the higher of the rates will be used. Information about the Index is available or published daily in the Wall Street Journal. You acknowledge that the Prime Rate as used herein does not mean the lowest rate at which the Bank has made or may make loans to any of its customers, either now or in the future. If the Index becomes unavailable, the Bank may designate a substitute Index after providing notice to you. The APR will increase when the Prime Rate increases. If the Prime Rate changes, resulting in a change in the APR, the change will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle the following month.
10.7: APRs and DPRs FOR AMEGY BANK EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS:
10.7.1: DPR and APR for Purchases. The DPR will be 1/365 (1/366 for a leap year) of the then current APR. The APR which is calculated on the average daily balance is a variable rate (subject to limits set by statute). The APR in effect throughout a particular billing period will be the Prime Rate plus 3.25% for Visa Platinum or 4.50% for Visa Classic. 
10.7.2: DPR for Purchases: The DPR for transactions posting as Purchases is equal to its corresponding APR. To determine your rate for Purchases we add the Index to the applicable margin as follows:

� 4.50% resulting in a DPR of 0.021233 (corresponding APR of 7.75%)

10.7.4: DPR for Cash Advances, Quasi Cash Transactions and Balance Transfers: The DPR for transactions posting as a cash advance, quasi cash transaction or balance transfer is equal to its corresponding APR. To determine the rate, we add the Index to a margin of 10.00% resulting in a DPR of 0.036301 (corresponding APR of 13.25%).

11.0: CASH ADVANCE AND QUASI CASH TRANSACTION FEE: Each new cash advance or quasi cash transaction will be assessed a one-time transaction fee not to exceed the greater of $2 or 2% of the transaction. The transaction fee shall be fully earned when assessed.

12.0: OTHER FEES AND CHARGES:
12.1: Balance Transfer Fee: Each new Balance Transfer will be assessed a fee equal to 2% of the Balance Transfer, but not less than $5.00 or more than $50.00.
12.2: Late Payment Fee. If the minimum payment shown on your monthly statement is not received at the proper address on or before the payment due date, there will be a late fee not to exceed the lesser of $15 or 5% of the payment due after unpaid for 10 days (including weekends).
12.3: Returned Payment Fee. If any check or other payment on your Card Account is dishonored or must be returned because it cannot be processed, there will be a Returned Payment Fee equal to the amount of the minimum payment due but no more than $25, which will be treated as a purchase item.

12.6: International Transaction Fee. 2% of the U.S. dollar amount of the transaction, whether originally made in U.S. dollars or converted from a foreign currency. If you incur a charge in a foreign currency, the charge will be converted into a U.S. Dollar amount by Visa International. Currently, the currency conversion rate used is either a wholesale market rate or a government mandated rate in effect one day prior to the date the transaction is processed by Visa International plus two percent (2%) of the U.S. dollar rate. The currency conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date or the posting date.
12.7: Research Fee ($15). For research that you request on your Card Account (unless such research involves an allegation of a billing error made by the Bank), there will be a research charge of $15 per hour, plus $5 per photocopy.
12.8: Expedited Card Delivery or Emergency Card Fee: If you request the Bank to provide �expedited card delivery� (which requires the services of an outside delivery service provider) or you request to personally obtain an �emergency card� (which requires special card production) at our Bankcard Center, you agree that we may charge a fee up to $75 for this service.

13.0: SECURITY INTEREST FOR SECURED ACCOUNTS. If you have a Secured Account, you have given the Bank a security interest in a savings account at the Bank to secure payment of your Card Account. If you withdraw your funds from the savings account, the Bank has the right to close your Card Account.

You understand that if you use a convenience check to make a purchase and you have a dispute with that purchase, the dispute is not covered by the Billing Rights Summary below. You understand that the convenience checks will not be returned to you. 
5 Purchases Treated as Cash Advances: 	We consider certain transactions to be the equivalent of cash advances, and we reserve the right to treat them as cash advances under this Agreement.

The cash advance limit will be shown on your monthly statement. We will not be responsible for failing to extend credit to you under this Agreement. You agree not to allow the balance on your account to go over the maximum credit limit established for your account.  We will not extend credit if: 
� The extension of credit would cause the balance of your account to exceed your credit limit or if the balance of your account already exceeds your credit limit, or if the balance on your Cash Advances and/or Purchases Accounts already exceeds a credit limit, or  
� Anything has happened that allows us to declare your account in default and therefore immediately due, or 
� Your Card has been canceled or suspended, or 
� Your Card has expired. 

If we do extend credit under any of the conditions above, it will be covered by the terms and provisions of this Agreement. We may delay extending credit if you have previously sent us a payment check or other negotiable instrument which has been returned as unpaid for any reason. 
7. 	Monthly Billing Statement: If you have a balance in your account, we will send you a monthly billing statement. It will show the total amount of your Purchases and Cash Advance Accounts, the ?nance charge, the minimum payment due, and the date the payment is due. 
8a. Finance Charge on Purchases: A ?nance charge will be imposed on each Purchase from the date the Purchase is posted to your account until the date it is paid in full, with the following exceptions:You mayavoid ?nance charges on purchases during any billing period if: (1) the opening balance on Purchases during any billing period was zero (0); or (2) the total of payments and credits posted during the billing period equals or exceeds the opening balance for that billing period. 
We calculate the Finance Charge on Purchases by applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your Purchase Account (including current transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your Purchases Account each day, add any new Purchases and subtract any payments or credits applied to Purchases that day, unpaid ?nance charges, late charges, overlimit fees and returned item fees. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the �average daily balance� which is shown on your statement as the Finance Charge Balance for Purchases. Finally, we multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate of .02986 percent (corresponding Annual Percentage Rate of 10.9%) and the number of days in the billing period. 
8b. Finance Charge onAdvances: A ?nance charge will be imposed on each Cash Advance from the day the Cash Advance is obtained until the date it is paid in full. We calculate the Finance Charge on Cash Advances by adding any Transaction Fee applied to new Cash Advances to the amount determined by applying the periodic rate to the �average daily balance� of your Cash Advance Account (including current transactions). To get the �average daily balance� we take the beginning balance of your Cash Advance Account each day, add any new Cash Advances, and subtract any payments or credits applied to Cash Advances that day, unpaid ?nance charges, late charges, overlimit fees, transaction fees, and returned item fees. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the �average daily balance� which is shown on your statement as the Finance Charge Balance for Cash Advances. Finally, we multiply the average daily balance by the daily periodic rate of .04630% (corresponding Annual Percentage Rate of 16.90%) and the number of days in the billing period. 
8c. Minimum Finance Charge: There will be a minimum Finance Charge of ?fty cents ($.50) for each billing period in which a ?nance charge is payable on your Purchases Account. 
8d. Cash Advance Transaction Fee: You will pay a transaction fee (?nance charge) each time you obtain a Cash Advance. The transaction fee will be 3% of the amount advanced but not less than $1.00 or more than $30.00. 

9. 	Returned Item Fee: We will charge you a returned item fee of $20.00 whenever your payment is returned to us for insuf?cient funds or any other reason. 

10. Late Charges: You pay a late charge of $25.00 any time a minimum payment remains unpaid for more than one billing period. 

11. Overlimit Fees: You will pay an overlimit fee of $20.00 if the principal balance of Purchases and Cash Advances exceeds your established credit limit on the closing date of your billing period. 

12. Payment: You promise to pay us all the amounts borrowed under this Agreement and any other amounts which you may owe us pursuant to this Agreement.

Paying more than the minimum payment for your account for any billing period will not relieve you of the obligation to pay any further minimum payment for your account. 

13. Payment Allocation: Your payment will be applied in the following order to any of these costs you owe: (1) collection costs, (2) fees and other card charges, (3) late charges, ?nance charges and insurance premiums in manner and order Credit Union elects, (4) unpaid principal balance of accrued Purchases and Cash Advances.

1) Extensions of Credit. If your application is approved, the Credit Union may, at its discretion, establish a credit card account in your name and cause one or more cards to be issued to you or those designated by you. In such event, you authorize the Credit Union to pay for your account, all items reflecting credit purchases and cash advances obtained through use of the card. The Credit Union, may at its discretion, issue checks to you which may be used for any purpose other than making a payment for credit to your account. Any check written by you will be considered as a cash advance, even if used to make a purchase. By signing such a check, you authorize the Credit Union to pay the item for the amount indicated and post such amounts as cash advance to your account. The Credit Union does not have to pay any item which would cause the outstanding balance in your account to exceed your credit limit. Please refer to the attached Rate and Fee Disclosures for charges that apply in connection with credit card convenience checks. 
2) Joint Applicant Liability. If this Agreement is executed by more than one person, each of you shall be jointly and individually liable to us for all charges made to the account, including applicable fees. In addition, you agree that each of you designates the other as agent for the purpose of making purchases extended under this Agreement and each use of your account shall be an extension of credit to all. Notice to one of you shall constitute notice to all. Any joint cardholder may remove him/herself from responsibility for future purchases at any time by notifying us in writing. However, removal from the account does not release the joint cardholder from any liability already incurred.
3) Others Using Your Account. If you allow anyone else to use your card, you will be liable for all credit extended to such persons. You promise to pay for all purchases, balance transfers, and cash advances made by anyone whom you authorize to use your card, whether or not you notify us that he or she will be using it. If someone else is authorized to use your card and you want to end that person�s privilege, you must notify us in writing, and if he or she has a card, you must return the card with your written notice for it to be effective.
4) Credit Limits. You promise the payments made for your account resulting from use of the card will, at no time, cause the outstanding balance in your account to exceed your credit limit as disclosed to you at the time you receive your card or as adjusted from time to time at the discretion of the Credit Union.
5) Promise To Pay. You promise to repay the Credit Union all payments made for your account resulting from use of the card, plus INTEREST CHARGES on the unpaid balance. At the end of each monthly billing cycle, you will be furnished with a periodic statement showing (1) the �previous balance� (the outstanding balance in the account at the beginning of the billing cycle), (2) the amount of all cash advances, balance transfers, purchases and INTEREST CHARGES posted to your account during the billing cycle, (3) the amount of all payments and credits posted to your account during the billing cycle, and (4) the �new balance� which is the sum of (1) and (2) less (3). You agree to pay on or before the �payment due date� shown on the periodic statement either the entire �new balance�, or a minimum payment equal to 3% of the �new balance�, or $18.00, whichever is greater, if the �new balance� is $18.00 or less, you will pay in full.
6) Cost of Credit. You will pay INTEREST CHARGES for all advances made against your account. INTEREST CHARGES for cash advances and balance transfers begin to accrue on the date of the advance. New purchases will not incur an INTEREST CHARGE on the date they are posted to your account if you have paid the account in full by the �payment due date� shown on your most recent monthly statement, or if there was no previous balance.
Thereafter, your account is subject to a variable rate, and the APR may increase. The applicable periodic rate used to compute the INTEREST CHARGES for all advances is based on an index (the �Index�), which is the Prime Rate as published in the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal on the 10th day of the month and is subject to change monthly. If the 10th falls on a weekend or a holiday in any given month, then we will use the Prime Rate published on the next business day for that month. Any change in the Index will be effective on the first day of the billing cycle in the month following the date of the change. An increase in the Index may result in an increase in the periodic rate, which in turn, may result in higher payments. We retain the discretion not to increase your rate when the Index increases, but such action does not preclude us from increasing the rate in step with Index increases on future occasions. 
We will add a margin to the Index to determine your daily periodic rate and corresponding APR. The margin for VISA Platinum Rewards, and MasterCard Platinum Rewards accounts is set forth in the Rate Disclosure attached to this Agreement. 
The daily periodic rates and corresponding APRs for VISA Platinum Rewards, and MasterCard Platinum Rewards accounts are set forth in the Rate Disclosure attached to this Agreement. The maximum rate for all accounts will never exceed a daily periodic rate of .049315%, which corresponds to an APR of 18%.
The INTEREST CHARGE is figured by applying the periodic rate to the �balance subject to INTEREST CHARGE� which is the �average daily balance� of your account, including certain current transactions. The �average daily balance� is arrived at by taking the beginning balance of your account each day, adding in any new cash advances and balance transfers, and unless you pay your account in full by the �payment due date� shown on the previous monthly statement or there is no previous balance, adding in new purchases, and subtracting any payments or credits and unpaid INTEREST CHARGES. This gives us the daily balance. The daily balances for the billing cycle are then added together and divided by the number of days in the billing cycle. The result is the �average daily balance.� The INTEREST CHARGE is determined by multiplying the �average daily balance� by the number of days in the billing cycle and applying the periodic rate to the product.
No additional INTEREST CHARGES will be incurred whenever you pay the account in full by the �payment due date� as reflected on your most recent monthly statement. The �payment due date� is not less than 25 days from the billing cycle closing date shown on your statement. You may pay any amounts outstanding at any time without penalty for early repayment.
7) Other Charges. Please refer to the attached Rate and Fee Disclosures for other charges that apply in connection with your credit card account.
8) Credit Insurance. Credit life and/or credit disability insurance is optional. If you qualify for and purchase the insurance from us, you authorize us to add the insurance premiums monthly to your loan balance and charge you interest on the entire balance. If you elect credit insurance, your payments may increase or the period of time necessary to repay your advance may be extended. The credit insurance rates may change. If the rates change, we will provide any notices required by applicable law.
9) Visa Card Liability for Unauthorized Use. If you notice the loss or theft of your VISA card or a possible unauthorized use of your VISA card, you should call the Credit Card Center immediately at:
(800) 442-4757
Under VISA�s zero liability policy, you will not be liable for unauthorized use of your VISA card once you notify us orally or in writing of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use.

You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.
10) MasterCard Liability for Unauthorized Use. If you notice the loss or theft of your MasterCard or a possible unauthorized use of your MasterCard, you should call the Credit Card Center immediately at:
(800) 442-4757
Under MasterCard�s zero liability policy, you will not be liable for any unauthorized use of your MasterCard once you notify us orally or in writing of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use and you meet the following conditions: (1) you have exercised reasonable care with the MasterCard; (2) you have not reported two or more incidents of unauthorized use of the MasterCard within the previous 12 months; and (3) you have maintained your account in good standing.

You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.
11) Crediting Payments. All payments on your account will be applied first to collection costs, then to any INTEREST CHARGES and other fees due, and then to the unpaid principal balance. All payments made on your account at the address designated for payment on the monthly periodic statement or at any of our branch offices during our business hours will be credited to your account on the date of receipt. If we receive a payment on a day that is not a business day for us or at a time that we are not open, your payment may be credited on the first business day following receipt. Interest paid or agreed to be paid shall not exceed the maximum amount permissible under applicable law, and in any contingency whatsoever, if we shall receive anything of value deemed interest under applicable law which would exceed the maximum amount of interest permissible under applicable law, the excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal amount or refunded to you.
12) Default. You will be in default: (1) if you fail to make any payment on time; (2) if you fail to keep any promises you have made under this or any other agreement with the Credit Union; (3) if you are the subject of an order for relief Under Title 11 of the U.S. Code (Bankruptcy); (4) if anyone tries, by legal process, to take any of your money in the Credit Union; (5) if you have given the Credit Union false or inaccurate information in obtaining your card, or (6) if anything happens which the Credit Union reasonably believes endangers your ability to repay what you owe.
13) Acceleration. If you are in default; the Credit Union may, without prior notice to you, call any amounts you still owe immediately due and payable plus INTEREST CHARGES which shall continue to accrue until the entire amount is paid. You expressly waive any right to notice of demand, including but not limited to, demand upon default, notice of intention to accelerate, and notice of acceleration. The card remains the property of the Credit Union at all times, and you agree to immediately surrender the card upon demand of the Credit Union. You agree to pay all reasonable costs of collection, including court costs and attorney�s fees imposed and any cost incurred in the recovery of the card.
14) Termination or Changes. The Credit Union may add to, delete, or change the terms of this Agreement from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any INTEREST CHARGES and other charges you owe under this Agreement. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized. The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. The Credit Union has the right to require you to pay off your full account balance at any time after your account is terminated, whether it is terminated by you or the Credit Union.
15) Unlawful Transactions. Your Credit Union credit card account(s) may not be used for any illegal or unlawful transactions. You agree that we may decline to process any transaction that we believe in good faith to be for an illegal purpose. You agree that we will not be liable for declining to process any such transaction. If we do process any transaction that ultimately is determined to have been for an illegal purpose, you agree that 
 
you will remain liable to us under this Agreement for any such transaction notwithstanding its illegal nature. You agree that any illegal use of the card will be deemed an act of default under this Agreement. You further agree to waive any right to take legal action against us for your illegal use of the card and to indemnify, defend, and hold us and VISA International, Inc. and MasterCard International, Inc. harmless from and against any lawsuits, other legal action, or liability that results directly or indirectly from such illegal use.
16) International Transactions.
MasterCard Cards: If you effect an international transaction with your MasterCard, MasterCard International will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard International will use its currency conversion procedure, which is disclosed to institutions that issue MasterCard cards. Currently, the currency conversion rate used by MasterCard International to determine the transaction amount in U.S. dollars for such transactions is generally either a government-mandated exchange rate or a wholesale exchange rate selected by MasterCard International for the applicable currency on the day the transaction is processed, which rate may differ from the applicable rate on the date the transaction occurred or when the transaction is posted to your account. We will charge a Foreign Transaction Fee of up to 1% on all international purchase, cash disbursement, and account credit transactions, even if there is no currency conversion. The Foreign Transaction Fee is a non-periodic finance charge and does not accrue interest. There is no grace period for repayment of international transactions in order to avoid the Foreign Transaction Fee.
VISA Cards: If you effect an international transaction with your VISA Card, the rate of exchange between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing the international transaction will be a rate selected by VISA from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. We will charge a Foreign Transaction Fee of up to 1% on all international purchase, cash disbursement, and account credit transactions, even if there is no currency conversion. The Foreign Transaction Fee is a non-periodic finance charge and does not accrue interest. There is no grace period for repayment of international transactions in order to avoid the Foreign Transaction Fee.
17) Visa Emergency Cash And Emergency Card Replacement Services. If this service is available, you acknowledge that we may provide personal data concerning you to VISA USA, its members, or their respective contractors for the purpose of providing you with VISA Emergency Cash and Emergency Card Replacement Services, and you consent to the release of your information for these purposes.
18) CREDIT INVESTIGATION: In conjunction with your application for credit and, if approved, maintenance of your account, you agree that we have the right to investigate your credit and employment history, to verify your credit references, to request and use credit reports, and to report the way you pay your account to credit bureaus and other interested parties.
19) Fair Credit Reporting Act Notification. We may report the status and payment history of your account to credit reporting agencies each month. If you believe that the information that we have reported is inaccurate or incomplete, please notify us in writing at PO Box 889, Texas City, TX 77592-0889. Please include your name, address, telephone numbers and account number.
20) Additional Provisions. Each provision of this Agreement must be considered as part of the total agreement and cannot, in any way, be severed from it. However, you also agree that should any part of the Agreement be found invalid, it will in no way affect the remainder of the Agreement. You understood that the validity, construction and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas. The Credit Union does not warrant any merchandise or services purchased by you with the card. All purchases and cash advances are extended at the option of the merchant or cash advancing financial institution and the Credit Union is not responsible for refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. The card(s) remain our property at all times, and you agree to immediately surrender the cards upon demand. We can accept late payments or partial payments, or checks or money orders marked �payment in full� without losing any of our rights under this Agreement. We can also delay enforcing any of our rights under this Agreement any number of times without losing them.

2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe your statement is correct.

� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount
� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.

Your Rights if You are Dissatisfied with Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing or electronically at:

either of us does not affect your obligation to pay the Account balance.
The Card remains our property and you must recover and surrender to
us all Cards, and any issued but unused Visa Convenience Checks,
upon our request and upon termination of this Agreement.
7. Credit Information. You authorize us to investigate your credit
standing when opening, renewing or reviewing your Account, and you
authorize us to disclose information regarding your Account to credit
bureaus and other creditors who inquire of us about your credit, to the
extent authorized by our bylaws.
8. Payments. We will mail you a statement every month showing
your previous balance comprised of purchases and cash advances, the
current transactions on your Account, the remaining credit available
under your credit limit, the new balance of purchases and cash
advances, the total new balance, the FINANCE CHARGE due to date,
and the minimum payment required. Each month you must pay at least
the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified
on the statement or no later than 25 days from the statement closing
date, whichever is later. If your statement says the payment is ""Now
Due,"" your payment is due no later than 25 days from the statement
closing date. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the
minimum payment or pay the Total New Balance in full. If you make
extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the
minimum payment each month your Account has a balance (other than
a credit balance).
Payment checks must be drawn on a financial institution or other
entity domiciled in the United States. Otherwise, posting of your
payment may be delayed if presentment of a check is drawn on a non-
United States domiciled financial institution or entity. The payment
will not be credited to your account until the funds have been collected
in United States dollars. You also agree to allow the Credit Union to
debit your account for any collection of processing fees associated with
handling this payment.
The minimum payment for the Visa Platinum Rewards and Visa
Platinum card will be either Two percent (2%) of your total New
Balance or $10, whichever is greater or your total new balance, if it is
less than Ten Dollars ($10) plus any portion of the minimum
payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid.
We also have the right to demand immediate payment of any
amount by which you are over your credit limit.
We will apply your minimum payment first to the FINANCE
CHARGE on balance transfers, cash advances and purchases, then to
fees, then to the principal balance of promotional cash advances, then
to the principal balance of promotional purchases, then to the principal
balances of purchases in the order they were posted to your Account,
and then to the principal balance of cash advances. Any amount in
excess of the minimum payment will be applied to the balance with the
highest ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE.
9. FINANCE CHARGES. You can avoid a FINANCE CHARGE
on purchases by paying the full amount of the New Balance of
purchases each month within 25 days of your statement closing date.
Otherwise, any unpaid New Balances of purchases and subsequent
purchases from the date they are posted to your Account will be subject
to FINANCE CHARGES. Cash advances, which include the amount
of any Visa convenience checks or balance transfers posted to your
account, are always subject to FINANCE CHARGES from the date
they are posted to your Account.
In addition to the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE you will be
charged a transaction fee of 3% of the advance for each cash advance.
For additional details, see paragraph 18G.
A. See Rate Addendum for Rates regarding your account.
B. Any increase in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will
take the form of additional payments shown as total minimum
payments on the statement.
C. The following information is applicable to each of our Visa
Credit Card Line of Credit Accounts:
The principal balances of purchases and cash advances are
determined each day during the statement period, beginning with the
principal portion of your previous balances, reduced by payments made
and credits we apply, and increased by purchases and cash advances
made and debit adjustments we make during the statement period. The
daily principal balances are totaled and divided by the number of days
in the statement period, to produce separate average daily principal
balances for purchases and cash advances to which the periodic rate is
then applied.
Any increase in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will take the
form of additional payments shown as total minimum payments on the
statement.
10. Default. You will be in default if you fail to make any
minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due.
You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this
Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy, or
become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they
become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading
statements in any credit application or update of credit information.
You will also be in default if something happens which we believe may
substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. When you are
in default we can demand immediate payment of the entire amount you
owe under this Agreement without giving you advance notice. If
immediate payment is demanded, you will continue to pay interest, at
the applicable interest rates in effect under this Agreement, until what
you owe has been repaid. If demand for immediate payment has been
made, the shares and deposits given as security for payment under this
Agreement can be applied towards what you owe. We may also take
appropriate action as authorized under the Uniform Commercial Code
to repossess any and all collateral pledged to secure repayment under
this Agreement. To the extent permitted by law, you will also be
required to pay our collection expenses, including court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees. We can also exercise any other rights given
by law when you are in default.

and/or PIN to make transactions. You will retain the copies of the
transaction slips furnished to you in order to verify your monthly
statement.

the Card may give credit or returns or adjustments, and they will do so
by sending us a credit slip, which we will post to your Account. If your
credits and payments exceed what you owe us, we will hold and apply
this credit balance toward future purchases and Cash Advances, or if it
is one dollar or more, refund it on your written request or automatically
after three months.

Convenience Checks, if available, as you would use your Card to

electronically). You may call us, but if you do we are not required to
investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in
question.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER WE RECEIVE YOUR LETTER
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
?? Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we
received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already
corrected the error.
?? Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct
the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
?? We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as
delinquent on that amount.
?? The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we
may continue to charge you interest on that amount
?? While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are
responsible for the remainder of your balance.
?? We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
?? If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in
question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
?? If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay
the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees.
We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the
date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if
you do not pay the amount we think you owe.
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong,
you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to
pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also
reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name
of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let
those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the
first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.
YOUR RIGHTS IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR
CREDIT CARD PURCHASES
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services you have
purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to
correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to
pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within
100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase
price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these
are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement
we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the
goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase.
Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a
check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

the purchase, contact us in writing (or electronically) at:

of the applicants� income derives from any public assistance program; or because the applicant
has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.

Billing Rights: Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided below in Additional Disclosures Required by Federal Law. 
Additional Disclosures Required by Federal Law 
FINANCE CHARGES: In order to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases made since your last statement date, you must pay the ""Total New Balance"" shown on your most recent monthly statement on or before the ""Payment Due Date"" shown on that statement (which will not be less than 25 days from the ""Statement Date""). Otherwise the finance charge on purchases is calculated on the next statement period on previously billed but unpaid purchases and on new purchases from the date they are posted to your account. Balance transfers and cash advances are always subject to a finance charge from the date they are posted to your account. You can always keep the FINANCE CHARGES to a minimum by making payments, whatever the amount, as promptly and as often as possible. Your periodic rate (for purchase, cash advance and balance transfers) is 1.08%, which corresponds to an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 12.96%. The FINANCE CHARGES are calculated by applying the above periodic (monthly) rate to the �average daily principal balance� (including new purchases) of your account. An average daily principal balance is calculated separately for purchase and balance transfer/cash advance transactions, and is determined as follows: For each day during the statement period (billing cycle) the principal balances of purchases and of balance transfers/cash advances from the previous day are increased by any purchases or balance transfers/cash advances posted to the�Account that day and decreased by any payments or credits posted to the Account that day. This gives us the daily balance. Such daily principal balances are separately totaled and then divided by the total number of days in the billing cycle resulting in the �average daily principal balances� of purchases and cash advances (which includes balance transfers) shown on your statement.

Classic VISA Card Agreement 
In this Classic VISA Card Agreement (called the �Agreement�), the words �you� and �your� mean or refer to each and all persons who have applied for the Card or Cards by signing this Agreement. �Card� means the Classic Credit Card or Cards and any duplicates and renewals thereof or substitutions thereof we may issue. �Account� means your Classic Visa Credit Card line of credit loan account with us. �We,� �us� and �ours� means or refers to this Credit Union. This Agreement is a Truth�in�Lending Disclosure Statement as well as a contract. 
1. 
Responsibility � By signing the Application that corresponds to and is incorporated into this Agreement, you applied to us for a Classic Visa Credit Card Line of Credit Loan. If we approve the loan and issue you a Card, you promise to repay all debts and the finance charges thereon arising from any authorized use of the Card. You agree not to let anyone else use the Card, other than the person(s) that you have designated in writing to us as an �authorized user.� You are agreeing with us that you authorize any and all uses such authorized user makes of the Card, whether or not such use was within the authority (actual, apparent or implied) that you gave that person in connection with the Card or otherwise. Therefore, you will be liable for all such use of the Card. Of course, once you notify us, we will take prompt steps to try to prevent any further Card use by that person. If this Agreement is signed by two persons, the Account is joint; that is, each of you, separately and�jointly with each other, is liable for all debts on the Account and FINANCE CHARGES thereon. Your obligation to pay all such debts and FINANCE CHARGES thereon continues even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which we are not a party may direct that only one of you, or some person other than you (or both of you), must pay such debts and FINANCE CHARGES. 

2. 
Credit Line � We have established a self�replenishing line of credit for you and will notify you of the amount thereof (�credit limit�) in the mailer in which we send your Card. That mailer is hereby incorporated herein as part of this�Agreement. You agree not to let your Account Balance exceed such amount. Each payment you make on the Account will replenish your credit limit by the part of that payment which is applied to principal. You may request an increase in the credit limit by a written application, which must be approved by us. We may increase or decrease the limit from time to time or may, with good cause, revoke your Card and terminate this Agreement; in either event, we will give you written notice of such action. �Good Cause� includes your failure to satisfy the terms of this Agreement or our adverse reevaluation of your credit worthiness. You may terminate this Agreement, at any time and for any reason, by giving us written notice. Nevertheless, termination by you or by us does not affect your obligation to pay all debts and FINANCE CHARGES thereon arising from authorized use of your Card. The Cards remain our property and you must recover and surrender to us all Cards upon our request or upon termination of this�Agreement. 

3. 
Using the Card � Immediately upon receipt of your card(s), each must be signed (in the space provided on the back) by the person whose name is embossed thereon. That signature must be in the same form as embossed on the front of the Card. To make a purchase or Cash Advance, present the Card to a participating Visa plan merchant or financial institution, or to us, and sign the sales draft or cash advance draft which will be imprinted with your Card. Please note that we are not responsible if a particular Visa plan merchant or financial institution refuses to honor your Card. You will receive a copy of any draft you sign when using the Card which you should retain to verify your monthly statement. We will upon request furnish you with a copy of a draft at a charge of $5.00 per copy; however, no charge will be made in cases covered by Sec. 226.13 (f) (2) of the regulation (i.e., Regulation Z) issued under the Truth�in�Lending Act. You agree not to make or permit to be made any illegal transactions on your Account through use of a Card, a check, or in any other manner. We may deny authorization for any Internet gambling transaction. 

4. 
Monthly Payment � We will mail you a statement every month showing your Previous Balance of purchases and cash advances, the current transactions on your Account, the remaining credit available under your Credit Line, the New Balance of purchases and cash advances, the Total New Balance, the FINANCE CHARGES due to date, and the Minimum Payment required. Every month you must pay the Minimum Payment within 25 days of your statement closing date. You may; of course, pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment, or pay the Total New Balance in full; and you will reduce your FINANCE CHARGES by doing so. The Minimum Payment will be either (a) 3% of your Total New Balance, or $10.00, whichever is greater; or (b) your Total New Balance, if it is less than $10.00 plus (c) any portion of the Minimum Payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid. In addition, at any time your Total New Balance exceeds your Credit Line, you must immediately pay the excess upon our demand. We will apply your payments first to previously billed and unpaid FINANCE CHARGES on purchases; then to previously billed and unpaid FINANCE CHARGES on cash advances; then to previously billed purchases; then to cash advances; and then to new purchases, whether or not billed on the monthly statement. However, any payment equal to, or greater than, the Previous Balance of Purchases will be applied first to that balance and any 



FINANCE CHARGES thereon so as to avoid continuing accrual of FINANCE CHARGES on that amount. 
5. 
Finance Charges � The way we calculate FINANCE CHARGES, including your periodic rate and corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, are disclosed above in the Additional Disclosures Required by Federal Law. The FINANCE CHARGES hereunder may be increased pursuant to paragraph 9 on the reverse side, if you engage in foreign transactions. 

6. 
Other Charges � If the required minimum payment due under this�Agreement is not paid within 10 days after the payment due date, you agree to pay the Credit Union a LATE CHARGE of $25, unless the minimum monthly payment amount is less than $25, in which case the late charge will be equal to the minimum monthly payment. 

Your Account may be subject to other charges, which you agree to pay, including a fee of $5 for the replacement of card(s), a $2 fee per copy of statements, $5 for a Personal Identification Number (PIN) replacement, and a $5 fee for a copy of a sales draft (see Section 3 for an exception to that fee). You also agree to pay a charge in the amount of $25 for any check made payable to your Account and returned due to non�sufficient funds. 

7. 
Credits � If merchants who honor your Card give you a credit for returns or adjustments, they will do so by posting a credit to your Account. You should keep your copy of the credit slip to verify your monthly statement. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe us on the Account, we will credit such excess to your savings account or we will refund it upon request. 

8. 
Waiver of Security � Regardless of anything contained in any other loan document you have previously signed, we hereby expressly waive any security interest, or pledge of shares or deposits, as security for balances owing on this Account. 

9. 
Foreign Transactions � Purchases and Cash Advances you make in foreign countries and foreign currency will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. The conversion to U.S. dollars will be calculated based on a government�mandated rate in effect one day prior to the Processing Date increased by one percent. 

10. 
Loss or Theft of Card � You agree to notify us immediately upon discovering that your Card has been lost or stolen. Call 1�800�325�3678. 

11. 
Liability for Unauthorized Use � In most cases, you will not be liable for any unauthorized transaction resulting from the loss, theft or other unauthorized use of your Card, unless it is determined that you were grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handling of the Card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50. 

12. 
Default � The Minimum Payment shown on the statement is due by the payment due date as shown on the statement. You will be in default if you fail to make the minimum payment by the statement payment due date. You will also be in default if (a) you breach any other conditions of the Agreement, (b) if we determine that your creditworthiness (which includes your ability to repay us) has become unsatisfactory due to change in employment, increase in your other obligations, or any other reason, (c) if your�Account balance exceeds your credit limit, or (d) in the event of your death. In the event of any default or in the event this Agreement is terminated by you or by us for any reason, the entire balance on the Account becomes due and payable forthwith. You also agree that, in case of default, you will pay all usual and customary costs of collection permitted by law, including, but not limited to, attorney fees and expenses incurred by us in the enforcement of this�Agreement. 

13. 
Credit Information � You authorize us to investigate your credit standing when opening, renewing or reviewing your Account, and you authorize us to disclose information regarding our experience with you under this Agreement to credit bureaus and other creditors. 

14. 
Effect of Agreement � This Agreement contains our complete contract relating to the Account and applies to every transaction relating to the Account even though a sales, balance transfer or cash advance draft you sign or a credit slip may contain different terms. 

15. 
Amendment of Agreement � From time to time, we may amend this�Agreement by giving you written notice of the amendment at least 45 days before it goes into effect, unless a shorter notice period is permitted by law. The notice will be sent to your last known address appearing in our records when it is sent, and will state the date upon which the amendment will become effective. Except where prohibited by law, all such changes will apply to new transactions and to amounts you already owe, unless you provide notice of your election to terminate the account and surrender your card(s) on or before the effective date of the changes, in which case you will be entitled to repay your balance in accordance with the terms and conditions in effect at that time. 

16. 
Cash Advance by Machine � We will furnish you with a Personal Identification Number (PIN). If Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) or other electronic devices are available while this Agreement remains in effect which make it possible for you to obtain a Cash Advance by use of your Card in such a machine, your use of that number, together with your Card, in getting a Cash Advance from such a machine is agreed to constitute your signature for purposes of such Cash Advance. 

17. 
Personal Identification Number (PIN) � Upon request, we will furnish you with a Personal Identification Number (PIN). You agree to keep your PIN confidential. You also agree you won�t write the PIN on the Card or anything you keep with the Card. Your use of the PIN and Card in getting a Cash Advance or making a purchase is agreed to constitute your signature for purposes of such transactions. You can also use your card, together with your PIN, to get a Cash Advance from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in the Visa Network, to get a Cash Advance from a Visa financial institution or to make a purchase from a merchant that uses the Card in an electronic terminal that accesses the Visa system. 

18. 
Credit Union Membership � You understand and agree that the closing of your Credit Union Share Savings Account terminates your status as a member of the Credit Union, and upon such closing, you can no longer obtain credit with the Credit Union Classic Visa Card.

VISA Platinum/Platinum Cash Back Rewards/Platinum Member Rewards

VISA CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT
In this Agreement the words �you� and �your� mean each and all of those who
agree to be bound by this Agreement; �card� means the Visa credit card and any
duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; �account�
means your Visa credit card line of credit account with the Credit Union, and
�Credit Union� means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement
or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement.

1. Using Your Account � If you are approved for an account, the Credit
Union will establish a line of credit for you and notify you of your credit limit. You
agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances,
finance charges, plus �other charges�) which you will have outstanding on your
account at any time. If you are over your credit limit, you must pay the amount
you are over before payments will begin to restore your credit limit. You may
request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the
Credit Union. The Credit Union has the right to reduce your credit limit, refuse to
make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not
prohibited by law.

2. Using Your Card � You understand that the use of your credit card will
constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit
Card Agreement. You may use your card to make purchases from merchants
and others who accept Visa. However, you may not use your card to initiate
any type of gambling transaction. If you wish to pay for goods or services over
the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information
before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may
obtain cash advances from the Credit Union and from other financial institutions
that accept Visa, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all
ATMs accept Visa.) To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the
personal identification number (PIN) issued to you for use with your card. You
agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under
applicable federal, state or local law.

3. Responsibility � You agree to pay all charges (purchases and cash
advances) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your
account. You also agree to pay all finance charges and other charges added to
your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made
with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, Section 17 also applies to your
account.

4. Finance Charges � New purchases posted to your account during a
billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero
or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new
balance on the previous cycle�s billing statement by the payment due date of that
statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is
posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of
purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the
payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash
advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing
cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later.

The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances.
For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the monthly periodic
rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance
of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day,
add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us
the daily balance of purchases. Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases
for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the
billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases.

For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the monthly
periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To get the average
daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance
of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any
payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives
us the daily balance of cash advances. Then, we add all the daily balances of cash
advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days
in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances.
Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances.

VISA PLATINUM AND VISA PLATINUM MEMBER REWARDS
An introductory offer is available for our Visa Platinum and Visa Platinum
Member Rewards cards on purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers to
new cardholders for a period of 12 months from the issuance date. The monthly
periodic rate for this offer is 0.3250% which is an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE
of 3.90%. Thereafter, the monthly periodic rate of 0.7417%, which is an ANNUAL
PERCENTAGE RATE of 8.90%. This offer may be withdrawn at the Credit Union�s
discretion at any time.

When you are 60 days delinquent in making a payment, the monthly periodic rate
on your Visa Platinum or Visa Platinum Member Rewards account will change
to 0.9917%, which is an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 11.90%. When you
account is current for six (6) consecutive months, your APR will be reduced to

amount. In addition, your account is secured by all other shares you have in any
individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual
Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment
under state or federal law if given as security. You authorize the Credit Union to
apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts
due on your account if you should default. Collateral securing other loans you have
with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be
considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
any other agreement.

9. Default � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or
other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break
any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for
bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they
become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements
in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something
happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to
repay what you owe.

When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate
payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate
payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the
periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any
shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what
you owe.

10. Liability for Unauthorized Use-Lost/Stolen Card Notification
� You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not
be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us at PO Box 27755,

you will not be liable for any unauthorized purchase transactions. In any case, your
liability will not exceed $50.

11. Changing or Terminating Your Account � The Credit Union may
change the terms of this Agreement from time to time. Notice of any change will
be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in
the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well
as to future transactions.

Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but
termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay
the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this
Agreement. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account
after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized.

The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you
must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon
termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. The Credit
Union has the right to require you to pay your full account balance at any time

Union. If this is a joint account, Section 17 of this Agreement also applies to
termination of the account.

12. Credit Review and Release of Information � You authorize the
Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your
account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your
account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. If
your account is eligible for emergency cash and/or emergency card replacement
services, and you request such services, you agree that we may provide personal
information about you and your account that is necessary to provide you with the
requested service(s).

13. Returns and Adjustments � Merchants and others who honor your
card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending
the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits
and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied
against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00
or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6)
months.

14. Additional Benefits/Card Enhancements � The Credit Union may
from time to time offer additional services to your account, such as travel accident
insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit Union is not
obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.

15. Foreign Transactions � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign
currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange
rate used to convert foreign currency transactions to U.S. dollars is either a
government-mandated exchange rate or a wholesale exchange rate and is selected
by Visa. The rate Visa uses for a particular transaction is the rate Visa selects for
the applicable currency on the day the transaction is processed. This rate may
differ from the rate applicable on the date the transaction occurred or was posted
to your account.

A fee of 1 percent will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign
currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is
converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded.

16. Merchant Disputes � The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal
of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. The Credit Union is
subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or
services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but
have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and
(a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union
sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50
and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home.

17. Joint Accounts � If this is a joint account, each person on the account
must sign the Agreement (by signing on the application). Each of you will be
individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this
Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually
to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the
other(s) to make purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may
terminate the account and the termination will be effective as to all of you.

18. Effect of Agreement � This Agreement is the contract which applies
to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit
or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.
19. No Waiver � The Credit Union can delay enforcing any of its rights any
number of times without losing them.

20. Statements and Notices � Statements and notices will be mailed to
you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union. Notice sent to
any one of you will be considered notice to all.

21. Final Expression � This Agreement is the final expression of the terms
and conditions of this Visa line of credit between you and the Credit Union.
This written Agreement may not be contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral
agreement.

22. Copy Received � You acknowledge that you have received a copy of this
Agreement.

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS
KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE

This notice contains important information about your rights and our responsibilities
under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

Notify Us In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill �
If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction
on your bill, write us on a separate sheet at the address listed on your bill. Write to
us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent
you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but
doing so will not preserve your rights.

In your letter, give us the following information:

* Your name and account number.
* The dollar amount of the suspected error.
* Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If
you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.

If you have authorized us to pay your credit card bill automatically from your savings
or share draft account, you can stop the payment on any amount you think is wrong.
To stop the payment, your letter must reach us three (3) business days before the
automatic payment is scheduled to occur.

Your Rights and Our Responsibilities After We Receive Your Written
Notice �

We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have corrected the
error by then. Within 90 days, we must either correct the error or explain why we
believe the bill was correct.

After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or
report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for the amount you question,
including finance charges, and we can apply any unpaid amount against your credit
limit. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but
you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question.

If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any finance
charges related to any questioned amount. If we didn�t make a mistake, you may
have to pay finance charges and you will have to make up any missed payments on
the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount
you owe and the date that it is due.

If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as
delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us
within ten (10) days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we
report you to that you have a question about your bill. And, we must tell you the
name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to that the
matter has been settled between us when it finally is.

If we don�t follow these rules, we can�t collect the first $50 of the questioned
amount, even if your bill was correct.

Special Rule for Credit Card Purchases �
If you have a problem with the quality of property or services that you purchased
with a credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the
merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the
property or services. There are two (2) limitations on this right:

* You must have made the purchase in your home state or, if not within your
home state, within 100 miles of your current mailing address; and
*The purchase price must have been more than $50.

These limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant, or if we mailed
you the advertisement for the property or services.

creditcardagreement_3236.TXT,"VISA Platinum CONSUMER CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT

In this Agreement, �Agreement� means this Consumer Credit Card Agreement. �Disclosure� means the Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement.

1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will not allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that exceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled �Statements and Notices�) explaining your right to opt in to the Credit Union�s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in to such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor.

You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request.

2. USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers and money orders. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal.

3. PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account.

4. PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement.

5. FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date).

The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases.

For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances.

6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date.

A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.

7. FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.

a. Annual Fee. If your account is subject to an Annual Fee, the fee will be charged to your account upon the issuance of your card. Each year following, the annual fee will be charged to your account during the same month that you were first charged the fee. The fee will be charged each year until your account is closed and paid in full.

b. Balance Transfer Fee. If your account is subject to a Balance Transfer Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you transfer a balance from an account of another creditor to the account subject to this Agreement.

c. Cash Advance Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Cash Advance Fee (finance charge), the fee will be charged to your account when you obtain a cash advance from an ATM, the Credit Union or other financial institution.

d. Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency.

e. Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.

f. Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when a payment is returned for any reason.

g. Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request.

h. Emergency Card Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to an Emergency Card Replacement Fee, a fee will be charged to your account for each emergency replacement card that is issued to you.

i. Card Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to a Card Replacement Fee, a fee will be charged for each replacement card that is issued to you for any reason.

8. PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 3.00% of your total new balance, or $15.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on the statement. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit.

9. PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate.

10. SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount.

Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default.

Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement.

11. DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe.

When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe.

12. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION � You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at Cardmember Services, PO Box 30495, Tampa, FL 33630 or telephone (800) 808-7230 seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.

13. CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT � As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions.

Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized.

The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account.

14. CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS � Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user. If you cannot return the authorized user's card or access checks and if you request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for a new account.

15. CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION � You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. If your account is eligible for emergency cash and/or emergency card replacement services, and you request such services, you agree that we may provide personal information about you and your account that is necessary to provide you with the requested service(s).

16. RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS � Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account.

If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6) months.

17. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS � The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you.

ACCOUNT
Taking into consideration the credit granted by Banco Popular of Puerto Rico (Bank) under this account, you bind yourself to pay to the Bank the total price of all purchases and cash advances (includes balance transfers from other institutions and convenience checks) made on this account, as well as the INTEREST CHARGES agreed upon under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Under this new credit plan, the Bank will issue two types of cards per individual, one revolving credit card (�Credit Card�) and one charge card (�Charge Card�). These cards may be used to purchase merchandise and services in those establishments where the Cards are accepted, and to obtain cash advances from the Bank or any other bank that accepts the Cards, subject to the limits established from time to time by the Bank. Clients can choose within the product combinations offered by the Bank from time to time.

CREDIT LIMIT
You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases and cash advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each monthly Account Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you exceed your authorized credit limit; the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return or forfeit the Card and close the account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized credit limit and the total of the Charge Balance owed (please refer to the next section). The Bank may approve purchases or cash advances which cause the balance to exceed your credit limit without waiving any of its rights under this Agreement.

ACCOUNT FUNCTIONALITY
CREDIT CARD: �Credit Balances� refers to balances from purchase transactions made with the Credit Card and all cash advances, balance transfers from other institutions and convenience checks transactions made with the Credit Card or Charge Card, and any Charge Balance that have not been paid in full by its due date. Credit Balances are subject to the corresponding INTEREST CHARGES.

CHARGE CARD: �Charge Balances� refers to balances from purchase transactions made with the Charge Card. This balance is not subject to INTEREST CHARGES if the balance due from such transactions is paid in full by the payment due date of the billing period. In absence of the corresponding payment of the Charge Balance, the unpaid balances will be transferred to the Purchases Section of the Credit Card and will be subject to the corresponding INTEREST CHARGES applying the interest rate corresponding to the credit balance of your account. In addition, the corresponding Late Payment Fee will apply, as described in the table included.  The Charge Card may be used for balance transfers, cash advances and convenience check transactions.  The amount owed as result of such transactions will be subject to INTEREST CHARGES from the transaction date, applying the interest rate corresponding to the transaction type.  Please refer to the section �Interest Rates and Interest Charges� on the table included.

INTEREST CHARGES APPLICABLE TO PUERTO RICO, US VIRGIN ISLANDS AND BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS:
The INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on the principal balance only. You will pay a monthly INTEREST CHARGE on the credit balance of your account for the billing period. This INTEREST CHARGE will be variable and can change for each billing period. The INTEREST CHARGE for Credit Balances will be determined by adding the value of the United States Prime Rate, published in The Wall Street Journal (Prime Rate) effective at the time of the approval to a margin. This is equivalent to the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR). To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. The APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers from other institutions will be from 10.99% up to 23.99% with a corresponding Daily Periodic Rate from 0.0301% up to 0.0658%. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE for cash advances will be determined by adding the Prime Rate to a margin (please refer to this section on the table included to obtain the margin and APR applicable to your account). The APR for Cash Advances will be from 18.24% up to 23.99% with a corresponding Daily Periodic Rate from 0.0500% up to 0.0658%.  To determine the Daily Periodic Rate, the APR must be divided by 365 and rounded up not exceeding the limits allowed by law. Please refer to the �Specific Information on your APRs� section on the table included to obtain the margins and APRs applicable to your account. For Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands, the margin applicable to your account will depend on your credit history at the time of approval of your application.  For British Virgin Islands the margin applicable to your account will depend on the banking relationship you maintain with the Bank at the time of approval of your application. For each billing period, the INTEREST CHARGE and the Credit Balance APR will be based on the Prime Rate current three business days prior to your account statement closing date. In the event that The Wall Street Journal is not published within any time period, the �LA TIMES� will be used as reference. An increase of the Prime Rate could represent an increase in the APR and in the minimum monthly payment. Any change in your INTEREST CHARGE will apply to the Balance in your account and to new transactions during the billing period.� The INTEREST CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the number of days in the billing cycle. The Average Daily Balance is obtained by taking into account the initial balance for each day of the billing period, subtracting the payments and credits, and adding the purchases. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the said total is divided by the number of days included within the billing period. 

ANNUAL FEE
If applicable, the Annual Fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the Card.  Please refer to the �Annual Fee� section in the table included.

MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 
The monthly minimum payment will be determined by adding the minimum payment of the Credit Balance to the total of the Charge Balance owed. The minimum monthly payment for the Credit Balance will be determined based on the Outstanding Balance. For Balances from $0.01 to $24.99 the Minimum Payment will be the Outstanding Balance.  For Balances of $25 and over the Minimum Payment will be 2% of the Outstanding Balance or the Finance Charges + $10; or a fixed amount of $25, whichever is higher.  Then the minimum monthly payment for the Credit Balance will be added to the Charge Balance owed, if any, the total is the minimum monthly payment of the account.  In addition, the minimum monthly payment shall include the total amount in excess of your authorized credit limit.

PAYMENT APPLICATION
If you pay the required minimum payment of the monthly Account Statement, said payment shall be applied in the following way: first to INTEREST CHARGES and the remaining amount shall be applied first to the Charge Balance, then to the Credit Balance with the lowest APR, and then to the debt with the higher APR in ascending order. Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required payment, the excess will be applied to the most onerous debt.  Electronic, telephone and mailed payments are credited on the same day if they are received at or by 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday (excluding holidays).  Mailed payments shall be received at the address indicated on your Account Statement, made with a check drawn against the Bank, and accompanied with the payment stub. It will be also processed the same date if the payment is made through a Banco Popular branch in Puerto Rico or Virgin Islands during business hours in cash, or by check drawn against the Bank. Credit of other payments that do not meet these requirements may be delayed five business days during which interests will not accrue.

MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENT
The Bank shall mail to you a monthly Account Statement at the end of each billing period. In each Account Statement, the following entries will be shown, as applicable: new balance, minimum payment due, payment due date, credit limit, available credit, days in billing cycle, Late Payment Warning, Minimum Payment Warning, previous balance, payments, interest charged, fees charged, other credits, debits, purchases, balance transfers from other institutions, convenience checks and cash advances made within said period, year to date totals for fees and interest charged, interest charge calculation by balance type and the Annual Percentage Rate, You must notify the Bank, in writing, of any error in the Account Statement, within sixty (60) days, following the date on which the statement was mailed.

FEES
Currency Conversion Fee- Transactions made in foreign currency will be billed to you in U.S. dollars.  The currency conversion fees for international transactions into a U.S. dollar amount will be performed by either American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc., Visa International and or MasterCard International (collectively, the �Associations �or individually, the �Association�), depending upon your Card, using: a) A rate selected by the applicable Association from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date. The rate may vary from the rate received by the applicable Association, itself, or b) The government mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The Association will apply a Currency Conversion Fee to the transaction amount for any credit card transaction made in a foreign currency.  Please refer to the �Fees� section in the table included.

INSTALLMENT PLAN
Installment Plan enables you to perform a cash advance from your credit line allowing you to determine the repayment period for that balance.  The amount requested for the Installment Plan will be subject to your credit line availability. This offer is only available for repayment terms of twelve (12), twenty-four (24), thirty-six (36), forty-eight (48) months or sixty (60 months).  The APR, INTEREST CHARGES and Monthly Minimum Payment, of your Installment Plan may vary for each billing cycle.  The APR for your Installment Plan is equivalent to your APR for purchases, which is determined by adding the Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal to a margin. The minimum monthly payment of your Installment Plan will be included in the minimum monthly payment due of your account during the term of your offer. You will be responsible to pay the total minimum monthly payment amount as established in your account statement.  The INTEREST CHARGES will be calculated based on Average Daily Balance.

The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement.

1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will not allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that exceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled �Statements and Notices�) explaining your right to opt in to the Credit Union�s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in to such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor.

You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request.

2. USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers and money orders. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal.

3. PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account.

4. PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement.

5. FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date). The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. 

For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 

For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances.

6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. 

A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.

7. FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.

a. Annual Fee. If your account is subject to an Annual Fee, the fee will be charged to your account upon the issuance of your card. Each year following, the annual fee will be charged to your account during the same month that you were first charged the fee. The fee will be charged each year until your account is closed and paid in full.

b. Balance Transfer Fee. If your account is subject to a Balance Transfer Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you transfer a balance from an account of another creditor to the account subject to this Agreement.

c. Cash Advance Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Cash Advance Fee (finance charge), the fee will be charged to your account when you obtain a cash advance from an ATM, the Credit Union or other financial institution.

d. Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency.

e. Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.

f. Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when a payment is returned for any reason.

g. Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request.

h. Emergency Card Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to an Emergency Card Replacement Fee, a fee will be charged to your account for each emergency replacement card that is issued to you.

i. Card Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to a Card Replacement Fee, a fee will be charged for each replacement card that is issued to you for any reason.

8. PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 3.00% of your total new balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on the statement. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit.

9. PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate.

10. SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount.

Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default.

Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement.

11. DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. 

When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe.

12. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION � You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at Cardmember Services, PO Box 30495, Tampa, FL 33630 or telephone (800) 808-7230 seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.

13. CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT � As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions.

Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized.

The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account.

14. CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS � Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user. If you cannot return the authorized user's card or access checks and if you request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for a new account.

15. CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION � You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. If your account is eligible for emergency cash and/or emergency card replacement services, and you request such services, you agree that we may provide personal information about you and your account that is necessary to provide you with the requested service(s).

16. RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS � Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6) months.

17. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS � The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit Union is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.

18. MERCHANT DISPUTES � The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home.

19. JOINT ACCOUNTS � If this is a joint account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may terminate the account and the termination will be effective as to all of you.

20. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT � This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.

21. NO WAIVER � The Credit Union can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.

22. STATEMENTS AND NOTICES � Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the appropriate address you have given the Credit Union. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all.

23. SEVERABILITY AND FINAL EXPRESSION � This Agreement and the Disclosure are the final expression of the terms and conditions of your account. This written Agreement and Disclosure may not be contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement. Should any part of this Agreement or the Disclosure be found to be invalid or unenforceable, all other parts of this Agreement and Disclosure shall remain in effect and fully enforceable to the fullest extent possible under this Agreement.

24. COPY RECEIVED � You acknowledge that you have received a copy of this Agreement and Disclosure.

25. GAMBLING TRANSACTIONS PROHIBITED � You may not use your card to initiate any type of gambling transaction.

27. VOLUNTARY PAYMENT PROTECTION � We may offer Voluntary Payment Protection to you. Voluntary Payment Protection is not necessary to obtain credit. If you purchase Voluntary Payment Protection from us, you authorize us to add the fees or insurance charges monthly to your loan balance and charge you interest on the entire balance. At our option we will change your payment or the period of time necessary to repay the loan balance. The rate used to determine the fees or insurance charges may change in the future.

Your Billing Rights: Keep this Document for Future Use

This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement

If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:

       University of Illinois Employees Credit Union
       2201 South First St.
       P.O. Box 500
       Champaign, IL 61824-0500

You may also contact us on the Web: www.uiecu.org

In your letter, give us the following information:
       - Account information: Your name and account number.
       - Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
- Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.

You must contact us:

       - Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
- At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter

When we receive your letter, we must do two things:

1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will  also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:

       - We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
- The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
- While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
       - We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:

- If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
- If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.

If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.

Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.

To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
       3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing [or electronically] at:

       University of Illinois Employees Credit Union
       2201 South First St.
       P.O. Box 500
       Champaign, IL 61824-0500
       www.uiecu.org

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT

BORROWER 1			ACCOUNT NUMBER
BORROWER 2

DATE

In this Agreement, �You� and �your� mean any person who accepts this Agreement or uses the Card. The �Card� means any credit card issued to you or those designated by you under the terms of this Agreement. �We�, �us�, �our� and the �Credit Union� means Watermark Credit Union or its successors.


SECURITY: YOU SPECIFICALLY GRANT US A CONSENSUAL SECURITY INTEREST IN ALL INDIVIDUAL AND JOINT ACCOUNTS YOU HAVE WITH US NOW AND IN THE FUTURE TO SECURE REPAYMENT OF CREDIT EXTENDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. YOU ALSO AGREE THAT WE HAVE SIMILAR STATUTORY LIEN RIGHTS UNDER STATE AND/OR FEDERAL LAW. THE GRANTING OF THIS SECURITY INTEREST IS A CONDITION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF CREDIT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE IN DEFAULT, WE CAN APPLY YOUR SHARES TO THE AMOUNT YOU OWE. Shares and deposits in an Individual Retirement Account or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given are not subject to this security interest.

If you have other loans with us, collateral securing such loans may also secure your obligations under this Agreement, unless that other collateral is your principal residence or non-purchase money household goods.

Using Your Card. You can purchase or lease goods and services from any merchant who honors your Card, and you may obtain cash advances from financial institutions and ATM machines that accept the Card, up to your maximum credit limit. You agree not to present your Card or obtain a cash advance for any extension of credit in excess of your available credit limit; however, if you do exceed your credit limit, you agree to make immediate payment sufficient to bring the balance below the credit limit. Certain purchases and cash advances require authorization prior to completion of the transaction. In some cases, you may be asked to provide identification. If our system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even though you have sufficient credit available. Also, for security reasons, we may block the use of your Card in certain countries or geographic areas. We will have no liability to you or others if any of these events occur. 

Personal Identification Number (PIN). We may issue a Personal Identification Number (PIN) for use with your Card. This PIN is confidential and should not be disclosed to anyone. You may use your PIN and your Card to access your account, and all sums advanced will be added to your account balance. In the event a use of your PIN constitutes an Electronic Funds Transfer, the terms and conditions of your Electronic Funds Transfer Agreement may affect your rights. 

Promise To Pay. You promise to pay us in U.S. dollars for (a) all purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers made by you or anyone whom you authorize to use the Card; (b) all Interest Charges and all other charges or fees; (c) collection costs and attorney's fees as permitted by applicable law, and any costs incurred in the recovery of the Card; and (d) credit in excess of your credit limit that we may extend to you.  

Illegal Transactions: You agree that your Card and account will not be used to make or facilitate any illegal transactions as determined by applicable law; and that any such use will constitute an event of default under this Agreement. We may decline any transaction that we believe to be illegal under applicable law, including but not limited to any transaction involving or relating to any gambling activity. You agree that we will have no liability or responsibility for any such use by you or any authorized user(s); or for declining any such transaction. You further agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any suits, liability, damages or adverse action of any kind that results directly or indirectly from such illegal use. You promise to pay us any and all amounts owing on your Card for any transactions made by you, even if the transaction is determined to be illegal. 

Joint Accounts. Each of you will be responsible, jointly and severally, for the repayment of amounts owed, regardless of who initiated any transaction under the account. 

Others Using Your Account. If you allow anyone else to use your account, you will be liable for all credit extended to such persons. You promise to pay for all purchases and advances made by anyone you authorize to use your account, whether or not you notify us that he or she will be using it. If someone else is authorized to use your account and you want to end that person's privilege, you must notify us in writing, and if he or she has a Card, you must return that Card with your written notice for it to be effective.  

Ownership of Card. Your Card remains our property and may be cancelled by us at any time without notice. You agree to surrender your Card and to discontinue use of the account immediately upon our request.

Interest Charges. Average Daily Balance including new transactions: Interest Charges will accrue on your average daily balance outstanding during the month. To get the average daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new purchases, cash advances, balance transfers or other advances, and subtract any payments, unpaid interest charges, and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide that by the number of days in the billing cycle. We then multiply that by the periodic rate corresponding to the Annual Percentage Rate on your account. If you have different rates for purchases, cash advances or balance transfers, separate average daily balances for each will be calculated and the appropriate periodic rate is then applied to each.

Grace Period on Purchases Only: You can avoid Interest Charges on purchases by paying the full amount of the new balance for purchases each month by the date on which the payment is due. Otherwise, the new balance of your account, and subsequent advances from the date they are posted to the account, will be subject to an Interest Charge. You cannot avoid Interest Charges on cash advances; even if you pay the entire cash advance balance by the payment due date, you will incur the Interest Charges accrued from the date the cash advance is posted to your account. 

Fees. In addition to the Interest Charges set forth above, you agree to also pay any and all fees that you incur as disclosed to you on your Truth-in-Lending Statement or similar disclosures (as may be amended from time to time), or as disclosed to you during the term of your Card. 

If Your Card is Lost or Stolen or if an Unauthorized Use Occurs. You agree to notify us immediately if your Card is ever lost or stolen or if an unauthorized use may have occurred. ""Unauthorized use"" means the use of the Card by someone other than you who does not have actual, implied or apparent authority for such use, and from which you receive no benefit. The telephone number to call is (206) 382-7000 or toll-free (800) 732-9300 (after business hours call (800) 428-9348). You agree to follow up your call with notice in writing to us at: P.O. Box 24927, Seattle, WA 98124-0927. You also agree to assist us in determining the facts, circumstances and other pertinent information relating to any loss, theft or possible unauthorized use of your Card and comply with such procedures as we may require in connection with our investigation. You will be liable for any unauthorized use only if we can prove that you were grossly negligent in your use or handling of your Card, or if we can prove that you used your Card fraudulently.

Minimum Payment Due; Crediting of Payments. Payments are due in the amount and on the date disclosed on your billing statement. If your payment is received by us on a business day at the address and by the time designated on the billing statement, it will be credited to your account on the date of receipt. If payment is made at any location other than the address designated on the periodic statement, credit for such payment may be delayed up to five (5) days. Payments will be applied in any order we determine, subject to applicable law. 

Default; Acceleration; Credit Suspension; Collection Costs. You will be in default if: (1) you fail to make any payment on time; (2) if you fail to keep any promises you have made under this Agreement or under other Agreements you have with us; (3) if you die; (4) if you file a petition in bankruptcy or have a bankruptcy petition filed against you, or if you become involved in any insolvency, receivership or custodial proceeding; (5) if anyone attempts to take any of your funds held by us via legal process or if you have a judgment or tax lien filed against you; (6) if you make any false, inaccurate, or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update; or (7) if we, in good faith, believe that your ability to repay what you owe is or soon will be impaired, or that you are unwilling to make your payments. 

If you are in default, we have the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying interest charges and fees until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe. You agree to pay all reasonable costs of collection, including court costs and attorney's fees, and any costs incurred in the recovery of the Card, subject to applicable law. Even if your unpaid balance is less than your credit limit, you will have no credit available during any time that any aspect of your account is in default.  

Additional Benefits/Card Enhancements. We may from time to time offer additional services to your Account at no additional cost to you. You understand that we are not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.  

Convenience Checks. We may, at our discretion, issue checks to you which may be used for any purpose other than making a payment for credit to your account. By signing such check, you authorize us to pay the item for the amount indicated and post such amount as a cash advance to your account. We do not have to pay any item which would cause the outstanding balance in your account to exceed your credit limit.  

Credit Information. We may from time to time request personal information from you or obtain credit reports from the credit reporting agencies for the purpose of updating your credit status. Your failure to provide such information when requested by us may result in suspension of credit privileges under this Agreement, including your ability to obtain any future advances by any means. You authorize us to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize us to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureau and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. 

Foreign Transactions; Currency Conversion. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. The conversion rate in dollars will be a rate selected by the card company from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate the card company itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date in each instance. All transactions processed outside of the United States (which may include internet transactions) will be charged a foreign transaction fee in the amount disclosed on your Truth-in-Lending Statement (as amended from time to time). 

Termination; Change-in-Terms. We may, by written notice, terminate this Agreement at any time, subject to applicable law. You may terminate this Agreement by written notice. Termination by either party shall not affect your obligation to repay any payments made for your account resulting from use of the Card as well as Interest Charges and fees incurred. We may change the terms of this Agreement, including the method of calculating the periodic rate, at any time, by written notice, subject to applicable law. Use of the Card constitutes agreement and acceptance of any change in terms, unless applicable law requires otherwise. Our failure to exercise any of our rights or to take any action shall not constitute a waiver of those rights, or an amendment or change in any of the terms of this Agreement.  

Late or Partial Payments. Any payment that delays the reduction of your balance will increase your total interest costs. Partial payments or prepayments will not delay your next scheduled payment - you will still need to make the minimum scheduled payment by the next scheduled due date to keep your account current. We may accept late payments, partial payments, checks or money orders marked ""payment in full"" and such action shall not constitute final settlement of your account or a waiver or forgiveness of any amounts owing under this Agreement. 

Enforcement. We do not lose our rights under this or any related agreement if we delay enforcing them. If any provision of this or any related agreement is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, all other provisions remain in full force and effect. 

Returns and Adjustments. Merchants and others who honor the Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by submitting a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe us, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1 or more, it will be refunded upon your written or verbal request. 

Plan Merchant Disputes. We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor your Card. Also, we are not responsible for goods or services that you purchase with the Card unless: (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement we sent or participated in sending you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50 and was made from a plan merchant in your state or within 100 miles of your home; and only if you have made a good faith attempt, but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant. You must resolve all other disputes directly with the plan merchant. We do not warrant any merchandise or services purchased by you with the Card. 

Statements and Notices. Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the most recent postal address or e-mail address (if you have elected to receive such documents via electronic means) you have given us. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all. 

Notification of Address Change. You will notify us promptly if you change your address for any reason. In order to prevent identity theft, your identity may need to be verified before we act upon the notification. 

Copy Received. You acknowledge that you have received a copy of this Agreement.  

Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed under federal law and state law in the state in which we are primarily located, and the venue shall be located in the county and state in which we are primarily located. Operating regulations of Visa may also apply. This Agreement is the contract that applies to all transactions even though the sales, cash advance, convenience check, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.

BILLING RIGHTS NOTICE

Your Billing Rights: Keep this Document for Future Use
This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement 

If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at the address(es) listed on your statement. 

In your letter, give us the following information: 
1. Your name and account number.
2. The dollar amount of the suspected error.
3. If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.

You must contact us:
- Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. 
- At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do, we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 

When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 
- We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
- The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. 
- While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. 
- We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 
- If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
- If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.

If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. 

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct. 

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases 

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at the address(es) listed on your statement.

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

CONSUMER CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT 

In this Agreement, ""Agreement"" means this Consumer Credit Card Agreement. ""Disclosure"" means the Credit 
Card Account Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit 
Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" ""your,"" and ""yours"" mean 
each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any 
duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card 
line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on 
this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement. 

1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT -If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit 
for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, 
plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, 
the Credit Union will not allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows 
payment of advances that exceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, 
either orally, in writing, or electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled ""Statements 
and Notices"") explaining your right to opt in to the Credit Union's program whereby it will honor advance 
requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in to such a program, you agree to the terms of such a 
program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The 
Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account 
at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, 
we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience 
checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance or any other Credit Union loans. If you use 
a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a 
convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful 
dishonor. 
You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay 
any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop 
payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of 
the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, 
your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check 
number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment 
request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that 
time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six 
month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify 
you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid 
and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to 
us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. 
You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or 
claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of 
incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. 
2. USING YOUR CARD -You understand that the use of your credit card will constitute acknowledgement of 
receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure 
(Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The 
credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you 
wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security 
information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances 
from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller 
machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your 
card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must 
use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction 
that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you 
will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted 
to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in 
transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash 
advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery tickets, and casino 
gaming chips, as applicable. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction 
that is illegal. 
3. PROMISE TO PAY -You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of 
convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your 
account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of 
this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on 
JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account.

(Enter information (i.e. page numbers, credit union copy, member copy, etc.)) 



4. PERIODIC RATES -The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are 
disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to 
make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made 
pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, 
the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as 
disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of 
transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would 
ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the 
period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the 
Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily 
apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement. 
5. FINANCE CHARGES -New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance 
charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid 
the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; 
otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional 
finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the 
payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get 
the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, 
whichever is later. 
The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge 
is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily 
balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, 
and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. Then, we add all the 
daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing 
cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner 
as purchases. 
For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of 
cash advances. To get the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of 
cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply 
to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. Then, we add all the daily 
balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing 
cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. 
6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS -Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from 
your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used 
for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale 
currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives 
or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on 
the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder 
statement posting date. 
A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, 
cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a 
merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. 
territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure 
accompanying this Agreement. 
7. FEES -In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If 
applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this 
Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this 
Agreement. 
a. Annual Fee. If your account is subject to an Annual Fee, the fee will be charged to your account upon the 
issuance of your card. Each year following, the annual fee will be charged to your account during the same month 
that you were first charged the fee. The fee will be charged each year until your account is closed and paid in full. 
b. Balance Transfer Fee. If your account is subject to a Balance Transfer Fee, the fee will be charged to your 
account when you transfer a balance from an account of another creditor to the account subject to this 
Agreement. 
c. Cash Advance Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Cash Advance Fee (finance charge), the 
fee will be charged to your account when you obtain a cash advance from an ATM, the Credit Union or other 
financial institution. 
d. Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance 
charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign 
currency. 
e. Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account 
when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment 
Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
f. Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your 
account when a payment is returned to you for any reason. 
g. Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law 
and when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the credit union, a fee may be charged

(Enter information (i.e. page numbers, credit union copy, member copy, etc.)) 



h. Document Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Document Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law, 
a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request (except when 
the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union). 
i. Card Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to a Card Replacement Fee, a fee will be charged for each 
replacement card that is issued to you for any reason. 
j. Rush Fee -One (1) Day. If your account is subject to the Rush Fee -One (1) Day, a fee will be charged to 
your account as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
k .Rush Fee -Two (2) Day. If your account is subject to the Rush Fee -Two (2) Day, a fee will be charged to 
your account as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
8. PAYMENTS -Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date 
specied on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total 
new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum 
payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 2.00% 
of your total new balance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that 
you have not made, and any amount you are over your credit limit. In addition to the minimum payment, you 
must also pay, by the date specied above, the amount of any prior minimum payment(s) that you have not 
made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit. The Credit Union 
also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. 
9. PAYMENT ALLOCATION -Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the 
Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment 
in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount rst to the 
balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending 
order based on applicable annual percentage rate. 
10. SECURITY INTEREST -You specically grant the Credit Union a consensual security interest in all individual 
and joint accounts you have with the Credit Union now and in the future to secure repayment of credit 
extensions made under this Agreement. The granting of this security interest is a condition for the issuance of 
any card, which you may use, directly or indirectly, to obtain extensions of credit under this Agreement. 
Share and deposits in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax 
treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest you are giving. 
You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any 
amounts due on your Account if you should default. 
ADDITIONAL SECURITY: If you have other loans with us, now or in the future, collateral securing those loans 
may also secure your obligations under this Agreement. Please read any security agreement you sign in order to 
determine if the collateral also secures your obligations under this Agreement and other agreements you have 
with us. A dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary in any other agreement. 

11. DEFAULT -You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the 
date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in 
default if you die, le for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they 
become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or 
credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially 
reduce your ability to repay what you owe. 
When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account 
balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying nance 
charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were 
given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe. 
12. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION -You agree to notify us 
immediately, orally or in writing, at P.O. 31112, Tampa, FL 33631-3112 or telephone 866-820-3792 seven (7) 
days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the 
unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of 
the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your 
credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not 
exceed $50.00. 
13. CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT -As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the 
terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in 
accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specied in the notice to you, the change will apply to 
your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. 
Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit 
Union will not aect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any nance and other charges you owe 
under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any nance and other charges you owe 
under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are 
also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were 
unauthorized. 
The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the 
Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If

(Enter information (i.e. page numbers, credit union copy, member copy, etc.)) 

this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the 
account. 

14. CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS -Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for 
authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right 
to access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number 
and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any 
convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user. If you cannot return the authorized user's card 
or access checks and if you request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for 
a new account. 
15. CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION -You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit 
standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information 
regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. If your account is 
eligible for emergency cash and/or emergency card replacement services, and you request such services, you 
agree that we may provide personal information about you and your account that is necessary to provide you 
with the requested service(s). 
16. RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS -Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or 
adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If 
your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future 
purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your 
written request or automatically after six (6) months. 
17. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS -The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional 
services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the 
Credit Union is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time. 
18. MERCHANT DISPUTES -The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial 
institution to honor your card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising 
out of goods or services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable 
to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an 
advertisement the Credit Union sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than 
$50.00 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home. 
19. JOINT ACCOUNTS -If this is a joint account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for 
paying all amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you 
individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make 
purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may terminate the account and the termination will be 
effective as to all of you. 
20. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT -This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account 
even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms. 
21. NO WAIVER -The Credit Union can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing 
them.

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement 

If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at: 
American Airlines Federal Credit Union 
MD 2100 -P.O. Box 619001 
Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, TX 75261-9001 

You may also contact us on the Web: www.AACreditUnion.org 

In your letter, give us the following information: 
-Account information: Your name and account number. 
-Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
-Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and 

why you believe it is a mistake. 

You must contact us: 
-Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. 
-At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the 

amount you think is wrong. 

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not 
required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 

When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 

1. 
Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell 
you if we have already corrected the error. 
2. 
Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe 
the bill is correct. 
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 
-We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
-The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on 

that amount. 
-While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your 
balance. 
-We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 
-If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees 
related to that amount. 

-If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with 
applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment 
is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. 

If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us 
that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are 
questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we 
must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. 

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even 
if your bill is correct. 

Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases 

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have 
tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining 
amount due on the purchase.

To use this right, all of the following must be true: 

1. 
The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing 
address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if 
your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you 
the goods or services.) 
2. 
You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM 
or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 
3.

electronically] at:

may report you as delinquent.

",Error summarizing: index out of range in self
creditcardagreement_3591.TXT,"Visa Platinum
Agreement and Additional Disclosures
In this agreement (called the �Agreement�), the words �you�
and �your� mean or refer to each and all persons who have
applied for the Card or Cards by signing this Agreement.
�Card� means the Visa Platinum Credit Card or Cards and
any duplicates and renewals thereof or substitutions thereof
we may issue. �Account� means your Visa Platinum line of
credit loan account with us. �We,� �us� and �ours� means
or refers to this Credit Union. This Agreement is a Truth-in-
Lending Disclosure Statement as well as a contract.
1. Responsibility � By signing an application, you are
applying to us for a Visa Platinum Credit Card line of credit
loan. If we approve the loan and issue you a Card, you
promise to repay all debts and the FINANCE CHARGE
thereon arising from any authorized use of the Card. You
agree not to let someone else use the card. If an application
is signed by two persons, the Account is joint; that is, each
of you, separately and jointly with each other, is liable for
all debts on the Account and FINANCE CHARGE thereon.
Your obligation to pay all such debts and FINANCE
CHARGE thereon continues even though an agreement,
divorce decree or other court judgment to which we are
not a party may direct that only one of you, or some person
other than you (or both of you), must pay such debts and
FINANCE CHARGE.
2. Credit Line � If we approve your loan application, we
will establish a self-replenishing line of credit for you and
will notify you of the amount thereof (�credit limit�) in the
mailer in which we will send you your Card. That mailer is
hereby incorporated herein as part of this Agreement. You
agree not to let your Account Balance exceed such amount.
Each payment you make on the Account will replenish your
credit limit by the part of that payment which is applied to
principal. You may request an increase in the credit limit
by a written application, which must be approved by us.
We may increase or decrease the limit from time to time or
may, with good cause, revoke your Card and terminate this
Agreement. In either event, we will give you written notice
of such action when required by law or regulation to do so.
�Good Cause� includes but is not necessarily limited to your
failure to satisfy the terms of this agreement or our adverse
reevaluation of your Credit worthiness. In the event your
Visa Platinum Credit Line is cancelled or revoked due to
default, the balance at the time of default may be transferred
in-house with the Credit Union and, as a consequence
thereof, be included within your LOANLINER/Revolving
Credit Agreement for collection at the same rate as set
forth in the LOANLINER/Revolving Credit Agreement.
However, you may terminate this Agreement, at any
time and for any reason, by giving us written notice.
Nevertheless, termination by you or by us does not affect
your obligation to pay all debts and FINANCE CHARGE
thereon arising from authorized use of your Card. The Cards
remain our property and you must recover and surrender
to us all Cards upon our request or upon termination of this
Agreement.
3. Using the Card � We will send you a Card or Cards
embossed as you have directed. As soon as received, each
Card must be signed (in the space provided on the back) by
the person whose name is embossed thereon. That signature
must be in the same form as embossed on the front of the
Card. To make a Purchase or Cash Advance, present the
Card to a participating Visa plan merchant or financial
institution, or to us, and sign the sales draft or cash advance
draft which will be imprinted with your Card. Please note
that we are not responsible if a particular Visa plan merchant
or financial institution refuses to honor your Card. You will
receive a copy of any draft you sign when using the Card
which you should retain to verify your monthly statement.
We will upon request furnish you with a copy of a draft at a
charge of $1.00 per copy; however, no charge will be made in
cases involving error resolution.
4. Monthly Payment � We will mail you a statement every
month showing your Previous Balances of purchases and
cash advances, the current transactions on your account,
the remaining credit available under your Credit Line,
the New Balances of purchases and cash advances, the
Total New Balance, the FINANCE CHARGE due to date,
and the Minimum Payment required. Every month you
must pay at least the Minimum Payment within 25 days
of your statement closing date. You may, of course, pay
more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment, or
pay the Total New Balance in full, and you will reduce the
FINANCE CHARGE by doing so. The Minimum Payment
will be either (a) 3% of your Total New Balance, or $10.00,
whichever is greater, or (b) your total New Balance, if it
is less than $10.00 plus (c) any portion of the Minimum
Payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains
unpaid. In addition, at any time your total New Balance
exceeds your Credit Line, you must immediately pay the
excess upon our demand. We will apply your payments
first to previously billed and unpaid FINANCE CHARGE
on purchases; then to previously billed and unpaid
FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances; then to previously
billed purchases; then to cash advances; and then to new
purchases, whether or not billed on the monthly statement.
However, any payment equal to, or greater than, the
Previous Balance of Purchases will be applied first to that
balance and any FINANCE CHARGE thereon so as to avoid
continuing accrual of FINANCE CHARGE on that amount.
5. Finance Charges � Your Visa Platinum Account will
be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE (interest) at the
periodic rate of .825% per month, which corresponds to an
ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 9.90%. The FINANCE
CHARGE is calculated by applying the above periodic
(monthly) rate to the Average Daily Balance (including
new purchases). An �Average Daily Principal Balance� is
calculated separately for purchases and cash advances and
is determined as follows: For each day during the statement
period (billing cycle) the principal balances of purchases
and of cash advances from the previous day are increased
by any purchases or cash advances posted to the Account
that day and decreased by any payments or credits posted
to the Account that day. Such daily principal balances
are separately totaled and then divided by the number of
days in the statement period (billing cycle), resulting in the
�Average Daily Principal Balances� of purchases and cash
advances shown on your statement.
You can avoid FINANCE CHARGES on purchases by
paying the full amount of the New Balance of Purchases
each month within 25 days of your statement closing date.
Otherwise, the New Balance of Purchases, and subsequent
purchases from the date they are posted to your account,
will be subject to FINANCE CHARGE. Cash Advances
bear FINANCE CHARGE from the transaction date until
paid. There is no free interest period for Cash Advances.
However, you can always keep the FINANCE CHARGE to
a minimum by making payments, whatever the amount, as
promptly and as often as possible.
6. Other Charges � If the required minimum payment due
under this Agreement is not paid within 10 days after the
payment due date, you agree to pay the Credit Union a Late
Payment Fee of $20 or equal to your minimum payment
if your payment is less than $20. No late charge will be
imposed after this Agreement has become due and payable
in full due to default as specified in the section of the
Agreement entitled �Default.�
Your account may be subject to other charges including a fee
of $2.00 for replacement of damaged card(s) and a $1.00 fee
per copy of statements.
A charge of $2.00 will be billed to your account for a
Personal Identification Number (PIN) replacement.
There is no charge to replace a lost or stolen card after the
first, second or third occurrence. A charge of $50.00 per
occurrence will be billed to your account beginning with the
fourth occurrence of a lost or stolen card.
7. Credits � If merchants who honor your Card give you a
credit for returns or adjustments, they will do so by sending
us a credit slip which we will post to your Account. You
should keep your copy of the credit slip to verify your
monthly statement. If your credits and payments exceed
what you owe us on the Account we will credit such excess
to the Account and, if the amount is $1.00 or more, we will
credit it to your share account after 6 months or upon your
written request.
8. Foreign Transactions with Visa Platinum � Purchases
and Cash Advances you make in foreign countries and
foreign currency will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. The
conversion to U.S. dollars will be calculated based on a
government-mandated rate in effect one day prior to the
Processing Date. If you make a charge in a foreign currency,
we will charge you a Foreign Transaction Fee of 1% of the
converted U.S. dollar amount.
9. Loss or Theft of Card � You agree to notify us
immediately upon discovering that your Card has been lost
or stolen. Call 1-800-449-7728.
10. Liability for Unauthorized Use � You may be liable
for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not
be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify
Michigan Educational Credit Union at 9200 Haggerty Road,
Plymouth, MI 48170, orally or in writing, of the loss, theft, or
possible unauthorized use. In any case, your liability will not
exceed $50.00.
11. Illegal Transactions � You agree not to use your Card for
any illegal transactions.
12. Default � The Minimum Payment shown on the
statement is due by the payment due date as shown on the
statement. You will be in default if you fail to make the
minimum payment by the statement payment due date. You
will also be in default if (a) you breach any other conditions
of the Agreement (including your agreement not to allow
your balance to exceed your credit limit), (b) if we determine
that your creditworthiness (which includes your ability
to repay us) has become unsatisfactory due to change in
employment, increase in your other obligations, or because
of any other reason, or (c) in the event of your death. In
the event of any default or in the event this Agreement is
terminated by you or by us for any reason, the entire balance
on the Account becomes due and payable forthwith. You
also agree that, in case of default, you will pay all usual and
customary costs of collection permitted by law, including,
but not limited to, attorney fees and expenses incurred by us
in the enforcement of this agreement.
13. Credit Information � You authorize us to investigate
your credit standing when opening, renewing or reviewing
your Account, and you authorize us to disclose information
regarding our experience with you under this Agreement to
credit bureaus and other creditors.
14. Effect of Agreement � This Agreement contains our
complete contract relating to the Account and applies to
every transaction relating to the Account even though a sales
or cash advance draft you sign or a credit slip may contain
different terms.
15. Amendment of Agreement � From time to time, we may
amend this Agreement by giving you written notice of the
amendment at least 45 days before it goes into effect, unless
a shorter notice period is permitted by law or no notice is
required by law. The notice will be sent to your last known
address appearing in our records when it is sent, and will
state the date upon which the amendment will become
effective.
16. Cash Advance by Machine � If Automated Teller
Machines (ATMs) or other electronic devices are available
while this Agreement remains in effect which make it
possible for you to obtain a Cash Advance by use of
your Card in such a machine, we will furnish you with a
confidential Personal Identification Number (PIN). Your use
of that number, together with your Card, in getting a Cash
Advance from such a machine is agreed to constitute your
signature for purposes of such Cash Advance. If you use an
ATM that is not owned by us, you may be charged a fee for
using that machine to obtain a cash advance.
17. Personal Identification Number (PIN) � Upon request
we will furnish you with a Personal Identification Number
(PIN). You agree to keep the PIN confidential. You also
agree you won�t write the PIN on the Card or anything you
keep with the Card. Your use of the PIN and Card in getting
a Cash Advance or making a Purchase is agreed to constitute
your signature for purposes of such transactions. You can
also use your card together with your Personal Identification
Number (PIN) to get a Cash Advance from an Automated
Teller Machine (ATM) in the Visa Network, to get a Cash
Advance from a Visa financial institution or make a
Purchase from a merchant that uses the Card in an electronic
terminal that accesses the Visa system.
18. Credit Union Membership � You understand and
agree that the closing of your Credit Union Share Account
terminates your status as a member of the Credit Union, and
upon such closing, you can no longer obtain credit with the
Credit Union Visa Platinum.
19. No Waiver of Rights � Even though we may have rights
to take or not take certain action under this Agreement, we
may decide not to enforce those rights. Our decision not to
enforce any right we have under this Agreement does not
mean that we waive that right in the future.

VISA�/MasterCard�

CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT

 

NOTICE: See reverse side for important information regarding your rights to dispute billing errors.

In this Agreement, the words you and your mean the person or persons who use or authorize the use of, or who sign an application for, a Christian Community Credit Union VISA/MasterCard. Card means the Christian Community Credit Union VISA/MasterCard and any duplicates and renewals the Credit Union issues to you. Account means your VISA/MasterCard line of credit account with the Credit Union. Credit Union means Christian Community Credit Union.

1.Using the Account. If your application for a VISA/MasterCard account is approved, the Christian Community Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you and notify you of its amount when the card is sent to you. You agree not to let your account balance exceed your approved credit limit. Each payment you make on the account will restore your credit limit by the amount of the payment which is applied to the principal amount of purchases and cash advances. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by written application submitted to the Credit Union. The Credit Union has the right to reduce or terminate your credit limit at any time.
2.Using the Card. You may use your card to purchase goods and services in person, online, and by mail or telephone from merchants and others who accept VISA/MasterCard credit cards. In addition, you may obtain cash advances up to $1,000 of your approved and available credit limit from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions or select merchants participating in the VISA/MasterCard program and from automated teller machines (ATMs), such as VISA/MasterCard ATM Network, that provide access to the VISA/MasterCard system. (Not all merchants or ATMs provide such access.) You will need to use your Personal Identification Number (PIN) to obtain a cash advance from an ATM.
3.Illegal Use of VISA/MasterCard Credit Card. You agree that your VISA/MasterCard Credit Card Account will not be used to make or facilitate any transaction(s) that are or might be construed to be illegal pursuant to applicable law, rule or ordinance, including but not limited to gambling. Said use, including any such authorized use, will constitute an event of default under this Agreement. You agree that the Credit Union has no liability, responsibility or culpability whatsoever for any such use by you or any authorized user(s). You agree that you are responsible for repayment of any and all debts incurred for these transactions. You further agree to indemnify and hold the Credit Union harmless from any suits, liability, damages or adverse action of any kind that results directly or indirectly from such illegal use.
4.Responsibility. You agree to pay all charges (purchases and cash advances) to your account made by you or anyone who you authorize to use your account. You also agree to pay all other charges added to your account, pursuant to Paragraph 7. Your obligation to pay the amount owed on your account continues until paid in full even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which the Credit Union is not a party may direct someone else to pay the account balance. If more than one person signs this Agreement, each is individually responsible for all amounts owed on the account and all are jointly responsible for all amounts owed. This means the Credit Union can enforce this Agreement against any of you individually or all of you collectively.
5.Finance Charges. In order to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases made since your last statement date, you must pay the Total New Balance shown on your statement within 25 days of the statement closing date. Otherwise the FINANCE CHARGE on purchases is calculated from the beginning of the next statement period on previously billed but unpaid purchases and on new purchases from the date they are posted to your account. Cash advances and balance transfers are always subject to a FINANCE CHARGE from the date they are posted to your account.
We figure the FINANCE CHARGE on your account by applying the periodic rate to the ��average daily balance�� of your account. To get the ��average daily balance�� we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases, and cash advances, and subtract any unpaid other finance charges and any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the ��average daily balance.�
PLATINUM REWARDS VISA AND PLATINUM REWARDS MASTERCARD ACCOUNTS
Your Platinum Rewards VISA and Platinum Rewards MasterCard Accounts will be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE (interest) at an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and a corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate which will be a standard variable (floating) rate based upon an index plus a margin. The margin applicable to your account will be determined by your creditworthiness. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and the corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate will apply to purchases, cash advances and balance transfers.  
Index
The Index is Prime Rate (�Index�). Information about this Index is published in the Money Rates Table of the Wall Street Journal.

The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE may change on the first (1st) day each month. These are known as rate change dates. The Index value used for a given billing cycle will be the value published on first (1st) business day before the change date or the most recently published value published before the change date. If more than one rate is published, the Index will be the highest of the rates published. If the Index ceases to be published, the Credit Union will choose a new Index and give you notice of its choice.
Determination of Annual Percentage Rate
The Credit Union will add a margin ranging from 7.65% to 13.65%, depending on your credit score, to the Index to get the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE applicable to your Account for the billing cycle.  Notification of the margin for which you have been approved will be provided on the Platinum Rewards VISA/MasterCard Approval Letter sent to you upon completion of the credit review and approval.  
ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE for the billing cycle will be divided by twelve (12) to get the corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate for the billing cycle. An increase or decrease in the Prime Rate will lead to an increase or decrease in your ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and the corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate applicable to your Account.  
Limitations on Changes
There is no limit on the amount by which the rate changes in any one-year period. The maximum ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that can apply is 18.00%. 
Annual Percentage Rate Example
Based upon a margin of 7.65% (your margin may be different depending on your credit score) plus an Index value of 3.25%, (which was the value of the Index on February 1, 2010), your Account would be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE (interest) at an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 10.90%, with a corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate of 0.9083%. 
On the first (1st) day of each calendar month and on each subsequent change date, the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and the corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate will be calculated according to the formula described above and will be stated on our Platinum Rewards VISA/MasterCard Approval Letter.
BUSINESS PLATINUM REWARDS VISA ACCOUNT
Your Business Platinum Rewards VISA Account will be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE (interest) at an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and a corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate which will be a standard variable (floating) rate based upon an index plus a margin of 7.65%. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and the corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate will apply to purchases, cash advances and balance transfers.

6.Change in Terms; Changing or Terminating Your Account. The Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement, including your ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, from time to time for any reason not inconsistent with applicable law after giving you any advance notice required by law. Your use of the card after receiving notice of a change will indicate your agreement to the change. To the extent the law permits, and except as otherwise indicated in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. Either the Credit Union or any one of you may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. The cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union.
7.Other Charges. The following Other Charges will be added to your account, as applicable:
�If you are a credit card member only with no other relationship with Christian Community Credit Union, a one-time non-refundable membership fee of $5.00 will be charged to your credit card account.
�CASH ADVANCE FEE (FINANCE CHARGE): You will be charged a cash advance fee of 2% of the amount advanced with a $5.00 minimum.
�COPIES: If you request a copy of any document, we may charge your account $5.00 per copy requested. If your request is related to a billing error and an error is found, we will credit any copying charges to your account.

�NSF FEE: A fee of $25.00 will be assessed for each card payment that is returned to the Credit Union for non-sufficient funds.

8.Monthly Payment. Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the Payment Due Date shown. You may, of course, pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment, or pay the Total New Balance in full. If you make extra payments or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance. The minimum payment is 3% of your Total New Balance but not less than $10.00, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not paid. 
9.Default. You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to immediately terminate this Agreement and require repayment of your outstanding account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. At the Credit Union�s discretion, any shares that were given as security may be applied towards what you owe. To the extent permitted by law, you will also be required to pay the Credit Union�s collection expenses, including court costs and attorneys� fees.
10.Liability for Unauthorized Use. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of your card, you should write to us immediately at 255 N. Lone Hill Avenue, San Dimas, CA 91773, or call us at (800) 449-7728. 
You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.
11.Liability for Unauthorized Use of Your VISA Credit Card. If there is unauthorized use on your consumer VISA Credit Card your liability will be zero ($0.00). This provision limiting your liability does not apply to either Business Platinum Rewards VISA cards, ATM cash disbursements, or non-VISA PIN-less debit transactions. Additionally, your liability with respect to unauthorized transactions may be greater than the above limit, to the extent allowed under applicable law, if the Christian Community Credit Union reasonably determines, based on substantial evidence, that you were grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handling of your account or card.
12. Liability for Unauthorized Use of your MasterCard. If there is an unauthorized use of your MasterCard then your liability will be zero ($0.00) so long as: 1) You exercised reasonable care in safeguarding your card from risk of loss or theft; 2) You have not reported two or more incidents of unauthorized use within the preceding twelve (12) months; and 3) Your account is in good standing.
If you cannot meet these requirements then your liability with respect to unauthorized transactions may be greater than the above zero ($0.00) liability limit, to the extent allowed under applicable law. In any case, to minimize your potential liability you should notify us of any unauthorized use no later than 60 days after your statement was mailed to you. This provision limiting your liability does not apply to either MasterCard commercial cards or ATM cash disbursements.
13.Credit Information. You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. Pursuant to state law, you are hereby notified that a negative credit report reflecting on your credit record may be submitted to a credit reporting agency if you fail to fulfill the terms of your credit obligations.
14.Returns and Adjustments. Merchants and others who honor the card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the amount is $1 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six months.
15.Foreign Transactions. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. Transactions processed outside of the United States or in a foreign currency may be charged a foreign transaction fee, regardless of whether there is a currency conversion associated with the transaction. The conversion rate in dollars will be a rate selected by VISA from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable Central Processing Date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable Central Processing Date in each instance, plus a one percentage point (1.0%) fee charged by the Issuer.
16.MasterCard Cross-Border Transactions. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. If a cross-border transaction on a U.S.-issued credit or debit card is submitted to MasterCard in the currency of the country of the merchant, MasterCard will convert the transaction to the cardholder�s billing currency using its currency conversion procedure. MasterCard uses either a government mandated exchange rate, or a wholesale exchange rate selected by MasterCard. The government-mandated exchange rate or wholesale exchange rate MasterCard uses for a particular transaction is the rate MasterCard selects for the applicable currency on the day the transaction is processed, which may differ from that applicable to the date the transaction occurred or when it is posted to your account. Added to your cross-border transaction are a MasterCard Issuer cross-border assessment of eight-tenths of one percent (.8%) and currency conversion assessment of two-tenths of one percent (.2%).
17.Merchant Disputes. The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor the card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home.
18.Effect of Agreement. This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.
19.No Waiver. The Credit Union can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them.
20.Statements and Notices. You will receive a statement each month showing transactions on your account. Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the most recent address you have given the Credit Union. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all. You agree to promptly notify the Credit Union if you change your mailing address.
21.Transfer of Account. You cannot transfer or assign your account to any other person.
22.Governing Law. This Agreement and your account shall be governed by California law without regard to any conflict of law rules.

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS - KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE

This notice contains important information about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.
What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement
If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at: Christian Community Credit Union, 255 N. Lone Hill Avenue, San Dimas, CA 91773. 
In your letter, give us the following information:
�  Account information: Your name and account number.
� Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
� Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us:
�  Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
� At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.
You must notify us of any potential error in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter.
We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
� We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
� The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
� While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home State or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at: Christian Community Credit Union, 255 N. Lone Hill Avenue, San Dimas, CA 91773. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above.
After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.



",Error summarizing: index out of range in self
creditcardagreement_3750.TXT,"c) Statement Copy � A $5 fee will be charged for any additional Monthly 
Statement copy you request from Purdue Federal.

advance or make a purchase constitutes your signature for purposes of 
such transactions.

after 90 days. Activated cards that have no activity for a period of 22 
months will be deactivated and will not be re-issued. Any Account that has

closing the Account. Any rewards points accrued with this Card or Account 
will expire with the Card. 
Your Billing Rights 
This notice contains important information about your rights and responsibilities 
under the Fair Credit Billing Act. 

Notify Us in Case of Errors or Questions about Your Bill. If you think your 
bill is wrong or if you need more information about a transaction on your 
bill, write us as soon as possible on a separate sheet at the address listed 
on your bill. We must hear from you no later than sixty (60) days after we 
sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can call 
us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. In your letter, give us the 
following information: 

� 
Your name, account number, current address and day-time 
telephone number 
� 
The dollar amount of the suspected error 
� 
Description of the error and an explanation, if you can, why you

If you are disputing a transaction, further information about the 
dispute will be requested in writing by Purdue Federal in accordance 
with Visa U.S.A. operating rules. Contact Purdue Federal for more 
details. 
If you have authorized us to pay your credit card bill automatically from 
your savings or share draft account, you can stop the payment on any 
amount you think is wrong. To stop the payment, your letter must reach 
us three (3) business days before the automatic payment is scheduled to 
occur. 

Your Rights and Responsibilities After We Receive Your Written 
Notice. We must acknowledge your letter with a written notice within 
thirty (30) days, unless we have corrected the error by then. Within two 
Billing Cycles, but no later than ninety (90) days, we must either correct 
the error or explain why we believe the bill was correct. 

After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you 
question or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for 
the amount you question, including Interest Charges and we can apply 
any unpaid amount against your credit limit. You do not have to pay any 
questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated 
to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. 

If we find we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any 
Interest Charges related to any questioned amount. If we didn�t make a 
mistake, you may have to pay Interest Charges and you will have to make 
up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will 
send you a statement of the amount you owe, the date it is due and copies 
of documents or evidence, if requested by you. 

If you fail to pay the amount you owe, we may report you as delinquent; 
however, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write us within 
ten (10) days telling us you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we 
report you to that you have a question about your bill. We must tell you the 
name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to 
that the matter has been settled between us when resolved. 

Special Rule for Credit Card Purchases. If you have a problem with the 
quality of property or services you purchased with a credit card and you 
have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may 
have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or 
services. There are two limitations on this right: 

(a) You must have made the purchase in your home state, if not within 
your home state within one hundred (100) miles of your correct mailing 
address. 
(b) The purchase price must have been more than $50. 
These limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant, or if we 
mailed you the advertisement for the property or services.

Visa� Credit Card 
Disclosure and 
Agreement 

PLEASE RETAIN THIS INFORMATION WITH OTHER FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS. 

This Agreement covers each Visa Account �Account� you have with us. It 
also covers the use of your Purdue Federal Credit Card Convenience Checks 
�Convenience Checks� in connection with your Account. The words �you� 
and �your� mean each and all of those who sign an Account application 
and any person authorized to access your account. �Card� means a Visa 
credit card and any duplicates and renewals Purdue Federal Credit Union 
�Purdue Federal� issues. �Account� means your Visa credit card line of credit 
account with Purdue Federal. By requesting, signing, using or keeping your 
card and/or Convenience Checks, you are agreeing to all the terms and 
conditions of this document including the right to cross-collateralization 
and the granting of a security interest. 

1. Using the Account. When you are approved for a Visa Account, Purdue 
Federal establishes a line of credit for you and notifies you of its amount 
when the Card is sent to you. In order for it to be valid, you must sign your 
Card as soon as you receive it. By requesting, signing, using or keeping 
your Card and/or Convenience Checks, you accept this Agreement. You 
also accept this Agreement by using your Card or Convenience Checks. You 
agree not to let your Account balance exceed your approved credit limit. 
Each payment you make on the Account will restore your credit limit by 
the amount of the payment, which is applied to the principal amount of 
purchases and cash advances. You may request an increase in your credit 
limit only by submitting an application, which may be approved by Purdue 
Federal. Purdue Federal has the right to reduce or terminate your credit 
limit at any time. 
2. Using the Card. You may use the Card issued to you to make purchases 
in person or by mail, telephone or Internet from merchants and others who 
accept Visa cards. In addition you may obtain cash advances from Purdue 
Federal, other financial institutions participating in the Visa program and 
select Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), such as Visa ATM Network, that 
provide access to the Visa system (not all ATMs provide such access). You 
will need to use your Personal Identification Number (PIN) to obtain a cash 
advance from an ATM. A Visa card may not be used for any illegal transaction. 
3. Using Convenience Checks. We may supply you with Convenience 
Checks from time to time. You may use these checks to draw on your 
available line of credit on your Account. A Convenience Check drawn on 
your Account is a loan from Purdue Federal to you. You will owe us for the 
amount of the Convenience Check plus the applicable Interest Charge from 
the date of the transaction. 

4. Overdraft Protection. If you have requested your Account to be used 
to provide Overdraft Protection for a Checking Account maintained with 
Purdue Federal, funds may be transferred from your Visa Account to the 
Checking Account in accordance with the Guide to Member Services governing 
the Checking Account. All funds will be transferred in increments 
of $100 and are processed as a cash advance under this Agreement and 
treated as such. Such transfers are loans by us to you. You will owe Purdue 
Federal for the amount of such transfers plus the applicable Interest 
Charge. You understand that anyone who is authorized to make withdrawals 
from the Checking Account may access your Visa Account through 
Overdraft Protection. 
5. Responsibility. You agree to pay all charges (purchases, transfers and 
cash advances) to your Account made by you or anyone who you authorized 
to use your Account. Your obligation to pay the amount owed on your 
Account continues until paid in full, even though an Agreement, divorce 
decree or other court judgment to which Purdue Federal is not a party may 
direct someone else to pay the Account balance. If more than one person 
signs this Agreement, each is individually responsible for all amounts 
owed on the Account and all are jointly responsible for all amounts owed. 
This means Purdue Federal can enforce this Agreement against any of you 
individually or all of you together. 
6. Making Payments. You promise to pay all amounts you owe on your 
Account, including any Interest or Late Charge. When you receive your 
billing statement you may pay the full amount due or a lesser amount, but 
the least you may pay is the minimum payment amount shown on your 
billing statement. Your minimum payment will be any amount past due 
or over-the-limit plus the larger of 3% of your new balance or $20. If we 
elect not to require a minimum monthly payment at any time, the Interest 
Charge on your Account will continue to accrue at the Annual Percentage 
Rate. Whatever you choose to pay, your payment must reach us no later 
than the payment due date shown on your statement. 
7. Interest Charges. The Annual Percentage Rate is an interest rate set by 
Purdue Federal. Separate Interest Charges for purchases and cash advances 
are determined by multiplying the periodic rate by the separate average 
daily balance for purchases and cash advances. Each average daily balance 
is determined by taking the beginning balance (of cash advances or purchases) 
in your Account each day, adding any new purchases or cash advances 
(whichever is applicable) and subtracting any payments or credits. 
The results are the daily balances. All daily balances for the statement cycle 
are added and the total is divided by the number of days in the statement 
cycle to arrive at the average daily balance for the cycle. Cash advances are 
always subject to a Interest Charge from the date they are posted to your 
Account. If a grace period applies: 
(a) Purchases. An Interest Charge will be imposed on purchase posted 
during a Billing Cycle when the Previous Balance is not paid in full within 
the first 25 days of the Billing Cycle. An Interest Charge will also be imposed 
on Purchases included in the new balance when the new balance is 
not paid in full within 25 days after the statement date. 

(b) Cash Advances. An Interest Charge will be imposed on Cash Advances 
from the date of the transaction to the date paid. The Interest Charge 
accrued on Cash Advances will appear on your next statement. There is no 
time period which to pay to avoid the Interest Charge on Cash Advances. 
(c) Balance Transfers. Balance Transfers will be processed as Cash Advances 
and an Interest Charge will be imposed from the date of the transaction 
to the date paid. The Interest Charge accrued on Balance Transfers will 
appear on your next statement. There is no time period which to pay to 
avoid the Interest Charge on Cash Advances. We are not responsible for 
late payment or nonpayment to other card issuers. 
8. Monthly Payment. Each month you must pay at least the minimum 
payment shown on your statement by the date specified on your monthly 
statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum 
payment, or pay the Total New Balance in full. If you make extra payments 
or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum 
payment each month your Account has a balance. Your minimum payment 
required each month is disclosed on the Agreement under �Making 
Payments�. In addition anytime your Total New Balance exceeds your credit 
limit, you must immediately pay the amount over your credit limit. 
9. Payment Allocation. Subject to applicable law, your minimum payment 
will be applied to what you owe Purdue Federal in the following 
order: interest, fees, promotional rate balances, cash advance balances and 
purchase balances. Excess payments over the minimum payment will be 
applied to the balance with highest interest rate and any remaining payment 
to next highest APR in descending order. 
10. Security Interest. You agree this loan is also secured by all the shares 
and deposits in all your individual and joint accounts with Purdue Federal

Account and any other account that would lose special tax treatment under 
state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest 
you give in your shares and deposits. Property you have given to secure 
other loans will also secure this loan.

to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if 
you make any false or misleading statements in any credit applications 
or credit update. You will be in default if something happens that Purdue 
Federal believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you 
owe. When you are in default, Purdue Federal has the right to demand immediate 
payment of your full Account balance without notice. If immediate 
payment is demanded, you will continue to pay an Interest Charge at 
the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid 
and any collateral given as security will be applied toward what you owe

extent the law permits, and indicated in the notice to you, the change will 
apply to your existing Account balance as well as to future transactions.

owe under this Agreement. The cards you receive remain the property of 
Purdue Federal and you must recover and surrender to Purdue Federal all 
cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you

Convenience Checks that the credit union may issue to you. You agree not to present your Card, obtain a Cash Advance or write a Convenience Check for any 

extension of credit in excess of your available Credit Limit (the difference between your outstanding balance and your maximum credit limit) on your Account. 

Certain purchases and cash advances require authorization prior to completion of the transaction. In some cases, you may be asked to provide identification. If 

our system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even though you have sufficient credit available. Also, for security reasons, we may 

block the use of your Card in certain countries or geographic areas. We will have no liability to you or others if any of these events occur.

regard to any such fees. 

3. Maximum Credit Limit.

at any time, and may provide separate limits for purchases and for cash advances. We will notify you if we do, either by mail or through your monthly billing 

statement. Your continued use of the Card will show your agreement to any such increase. If you object to an increase in your credit limit, you must notify the 

Credit Union in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, your credit limit will be reduced to its prior limit; however, you will be responsible to pay any amounts by 

which you have exceeded the reduced limit. You agree to pay any amounts you owe that exceed your maximum credit balance upon demand.

any amount if your outstanding balance already exceeds your Maximum Credit Limit. Any increase in your Maximum Credit Limit requested by you will 

require you to make a written application for our approval. 

Credit balances in excess of $1.OO will be transferred to your share account within 30 days of the last activity. You agree that the Maximum Credit Limit will at

no time exceed the agreed upon amount, and that any credit balance will not be available or increase the Maximum Credit Limit available for new purchases or

your Account under the terms of this or any other agreements with us) extended to you or anyone else using any Card issued for your account, unless the use of 
such Card is by a person other than you, who does not have actual, implied or apparent authority for such use and from which you receive no benefit. Authority 
includes, but is not limited to, any authorized user's permitting another person to use any Card(s). Further, all users are obligated to us for all charges they 
make, authorize or permit. 

The Credit Union can accept late or partial payments as well as payments that are marked with ""paid in full"" or other restrictive endorsements, without losing 

any of our rights under this Agreement. If you pay more than the Minimum Payment Due, we will allocate the excess amount to your account balance. You 

must pay the Credit Union in U.S. dollars drawn on funds on deposit in the United States. If you make payment with other currencies or from an institution

domiciled outside the United States, then your payment will not be credited until the funds have been collected by us in U.S. dollars. We may accept checks 

marked ""Payment in Full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any right to collect the full balance of your account. 

Payments received at a staffed branch teller line will be credited to your account that day. Mailed payments to Arizona Federal, P.O. Box 60070, Phoenix, AZ 
85082-0070 received by 5:00 p.m. will receive credit that day. Mailed payments to the address noted above received after 5:00 p.m. will be applied to the next 
day's business. 

You authorize us to honor any Purchase or Cash Advance you make by telephone or mail on this account. You agree that a signature is not necessary as 

identification in such cases. We reserve the right to refuse to honor any request for credit, to reduce your credit limit or terminate your account at any time 
using our sole discretion, based on changes in the economy, the Credit Union's financial condition, your creditworthiness or for any other reason not prohibited by law.

or cash advances under this agreement any time the Credit Union receives a large payment ($1,000.00 or more), by a method other than cash, certified 

5. Minimum Payment Due. 
You can pay off your account balance in full each month or you can pay in monthly installments. Refer to your monthly periodic statement for your next payment due date. 
If you do not pay your balance in full, you agree to pay at least a minimum payment of 2.7% of your New Balance (rounded to the nearest whole dollar) or 
$20.00, whichever is greater. If the New Balance shown on your periodic statement is $20.00 or less, you agree to pay this amount. Unless the Credit Union 
takes other action as a result of a default under this Agreement, the Minimum Payment Due will also include any amount that is past due and any amount by 
which your new balance exceeds your credit limit. Payments and credits will be applied first to pay billed but unpaid finance charges, late charges,
and similar charges and next to pay cash advances and purchases. You must pay at least the minimum payment each month, but you may pay more than that amount
at any time without a penalty. The sooner you pay your new balance, the less you will have to pay in finance charges. 

6. Returns and Adjustments.
Merchants and others who honor your Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit transaction,
which will be posted to your Account. 

7. Multi-Currency International Service Assessment Fee. - Charges For Transactions in Foreign Currency and Cross Border Transactions. 
Currency Conversion Fee: If you effect or authorize a transaction with your access device in a currency other than United States dollars,VISA/ MasterCard 
will convert the charge into a United States dollar amount. The Visa / MasterCard currency conversion procedure includes use of either a government mandated 
exchange rate, or a wholesale exchange rate selected by Visa / MasterCard, as applicable. The exchange rate Visa / MasterCard uses will be a rate in effect on 
the day the transaction is processed. This rate may differ from the rate in effect on the date of the purchase or the date the transaction was posted to your Account. 
A currency conversion fee of up to 1% will be applied to transactions that are converted from foreign currencies to United States dollars. 
Cross-Border Transaction Fee: In addition,VISA/MasterCard charges us a cross-border assessment up to 1% on each transaction on all cross-border transactions 
regardless of whether there is a currency conversion. For purposes of this section, ""cross-border transaction""shall include both(a) transactions 
initiated in a foreign country, which are subsequently settled in the United States, and (b) transactions initiated in the United States but which are 
ultimately settled in a country outside of the United States. The Credit Union will assess these fees to you to reimburse it for the fee it is required to 
pay for each of your transactions subject to these terms. The fee(s) will be shown on your periodic billing statement(s). 

8.Finance Charges on Account Balance. 
A FINANCE CHARGE computed ON a daily periodic rate will begin to accrue for new Purchases,if you do not pay the New Balance in full within 25 days 
after the billing date of the statement on which the new Purchases first appear, A FINANCE CHARGE computed on a daily periodic rate will begin to accrue on the 
transaction date of Cash Advance(s) or Purchases (except as provided above), or the first day of the billing cycle, whichever is later, and will continue to 
be imposed until you have paid any outstanding balance in full.The Credit Union calculates the FINANCE CHARGE as follows: 

a. The Finance Charge will be figured by applying the daily periodic rate indicated on your Visa Credit Card Open End Credit Plan agreement form, to the average 
daily balance of Purchases and Cash Advances multiplied by the number of days in the billing cycle. The daily periodic rate and Annual Percentage Rate(APR) to
be used is determined by the account type approved by us pursuant to the terms of your application. The APR for purchases and cash advances may vary on a monthly basis. 
We will calculate the variable APR by adding a margin to the rate disclosed as the U.S. Prime Rate reported in the ""Money Rate"" table of the Wall Street Journal 
(paper version) on the third Tuesday each month of the year. The new variable rate will be applied to all existing balances not paid in full after any 
applicable grace period. The variable rate will not be higher than 18% or as otherwise ordered by the National Credit Union Administration (NCVA) Board, Your 
variable rate will be selected from the following seven (7) APR tiers based on individual creditworthiness and our underwriting standards. Your variable rate will be 
disclosed to you in each monthly statement. 

APR Prime + 4.49% APR Prime + 12.74% APR Prime+ 14.74% APR Prime + 17.74% 
APR Prime + 6.24% APR Prime + 13.74% APR Prime + 15.74% 

b. To get the total average daily balance on your Account, we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new Purchases and Cash Advances, 
unpaid Finance Charges, current late payment fees, any annual fee, if applicable, and other fees, and subtract any payments or credits. This is your 
daily balance. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide their total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives you the
average daily balance. This determines the balance subject to the FINANCE CHARGE. 

9, Overdraft Protection. 
Upon our approval, you may use your Card as overdraft protection on your checking account. Advances for overdraft protection are considered cash advances.
The Credit Union has no obligation to notify you of any advance under the overdraft plan. Further, if we cover one or more overdrafts, we shall not have any 
obligation to continue to do so. Please refer to the Membership and Account Agreement for the Overdraft Plan Agreement.

VISA
CONSUMER CREDIT CARD AGREEMENTIn this Agreement, �Agreement� means this Consumer Credit Card Agreement. �Disclosure� means the Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement.
1.	USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor.
You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six (6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. 
2.	USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery tickets, and casino gaming chips, as applicable. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal.
3.	PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account.
4.	PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement. 
5.	FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later.
The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases. 
For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To get the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. Then, we add all the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances.
6.	FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date.
A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates.
7.	FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
a.	Cash Advance Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Cash Advance Fee (finance charge), the fee may be charged for ATM withdrawals and transfers made from your card to any deposit account through Online Banking and Audio Line.  Overdraft transfers are excluded.  A cash advance fee may be initially charged for balance transfers initiated to pay off non-Delta Community Credit Union accounts but will be credited back to your Visa account. 
b.	Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency. 
c.	Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
d.	Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when a payment is returned to you for any reason.
e.	Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the credit union, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request.
f.	Document Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Document Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request (except when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union).
g.	Rush Fee. If your account is subject to a Rush Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each rush card that you request, providing delivery of the card is also available by standard mail service, without paying a fee for delivery.
h.	Stop Payment Fee. If your account is subject to the Stop Payment Fee, a fee will be charged to your account as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
i.	Visa Convenience Checks Fee. If your account is subject to the Visa Convenience Checks Fee, a fee will be charged to your account as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement.
j.	Over-the-Credit Limit Fee. If you have elected the feature to allow your account to go over your credit limit, we may charge you a fee as allowed by law. However, in no case will we impose an over-the-limit fee except in the next two billing cycles unless you have obtained an additional extension of credit in excess of such credit limit during each subsequent cycle or you have reduced the balance below the credit limit as of the end of each bill cycle.
8.	PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 3.00% of your total new balance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, and any amount you are over your credit limit. In addition to the minimum payment, you must also pay, by the date specified above, the amount of any prior minimum payment(s) that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. 
9.	PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate. 
10.	SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. 
Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default.
Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement. 
11.	DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe.
When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe.
12.	LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION � You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at 1025 Virginia Ave, Atlanta GA 30354 or telephone 800-544-3328 seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized purchases made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00.
13.	CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT � As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions.
Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized.
The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account. 
14.	CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS � Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user. If you cannot return the authorized user's card or access checks and if you request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for a new account.
15.	CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION � You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing.

16.	RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS � Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6) months.
17.	ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS � The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit Union is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time.
18.	MERCHANT DISPUTES � The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home.
19.	JOINT ACCOUNTS � If this is a joint account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases or cash advances individually. Any one of you may terminate the account and the termination will be effective as to all of you.
20.	EFFECT OF AGREEMENT � This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms.

This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.
What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement
If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:
Delta Community Credit Union
1025 Virginia Ave
Atlanta, GA 30354-1319
You may also contact us on the Web: www.deltacommunitycu.com
In your letter, give us the following information:
* Account information: Your name and account number.
* Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
* Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us:
* Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
* At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
	1.	Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
	2.	Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. 
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
* We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
* The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
* While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
* We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
* If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
* If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. 
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.
If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.

Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
	1.	The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
	2.	You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
	3.	You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing [or electronically] at:
Delta Community Credit Union
1025 Virginia Ave
Atlanta, GA 30354-1319
www.deltacommunitycu.com
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

CREDITS. If a merchant who honors Your Card gives You credit for returns or adjustments, the merchant will do so by 
sending Us a slip which will be posted to Your Account. If Your credits and payments exceed what You owe Us, We will 
hold and apply this credit against future purchases and cash advances, or if it is $1.00 or more, refund it on Your written 
request or automatically deposit it to Your Share Account after six months. 

CREDIT INSURANCE. Credit insurance is not required for any extension of credit under this Agreement. However, You

Your Account. If You elect to do so, You will be given the necessary disclosures and documents separately. Any credit

of all Cards and other Account Access devices. 

EFFECT OF AGREEMENT. Even though the sales, cash advance, credit or other slips You may sign or receive when

ENFORCEMENT. We do not lose Our rights under this or any related agreement if We delay enforcing them. We can 
accept late payments, partial payments, or any other payments, even if they are marked ""paid in full"" without losing any of

FINANCE CHARGES. In the case of any transactions under Your Visa Classic, Share-Secured Visa Classic, Visa

all Visa Credit Card purchases and cash advances by the application of a monthly periodic rate (and corresponding 
Annual Percentage Rate) to the Average Daily Balance indicated on Your monthly billing statement. 

To get the Average Daily Balance, We take the beginning balance of Your Account each day during the billing cycle 
(including any unpaid purchases and cash advances first posted to Your Account during the prior billing cycle; excluding 
any previously billed but unpaid Finance Charges and Late Charges), add any new purchases or cash advances and 
subtract any payments or credits (as described herein). This gives Us the daily balance. We then add up all the daily 
balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the Average 
Daily Balance. 

You can avoid Finance Charges on purchases by paying the full amount of the entire balance owed each month within 25 
days of Your statement closing date, provided the previous statement's balance was paid in full. Otherwise, the new 
balance of purchases, and Subsequent purchases from the date they are posted to Your Account, will be subject to a 
Finance Charge. Cash advances (including Visa Convenience Checks), are always Subject to a Finance Charge from the 
date they are posted to Your Account. All Credit Card accounts are subject to an Introductory Rate for the 6-month 
period immediately following the date that Your Card is activated, during which time the Monthly Periodic Rate that will 
apply to Your transactions is 0.2417% (corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGERATE 2.90%).

Variable Rate Information.

The following applies to any APR on your Account that varies with the market
based on the Prime Rate.  The APRs on your Account correspond to a Daily
Periodic Rate (""DPR"") (or a Monthly Periodic Rate (""MPR"") which is applicable
only to residents of Iowa at the time of Account opening). The applicable
DPRs/MPRs on your Account equal 1/365th (or 1/12th for residents of Iowa at the
time of Account opening) of the sum of 1) the applicable Prime Rate, 2) plus
the margin(s) listed above for each Purchase, Balance Transfer, or Cash Advance
balance.  The ""Prime Rate"" used in determining the APRs in each billing cycle
will be the highest rate published in the Money Rates column of The Wall Street
Journal on the last business day of each month.  An increase or decrease in the
Prime Rate will cause a corresponding increase or decrease to your variable
rates on the first day of the billing cycle that begins in the same month in
which the applicable Prime Rate is published.  There is no limitation on the
amount of any increase.  Any such increase or decrease will cause a
corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of interest assessed and
possibly in the amount of the Minimum Payment Due.  If The Wall Street Journal
does not publish the U.S. Prime Rate, or if it changes the definition of the
U.S. Prime Rate, we may substitute another index.  As of 09-30-2011 the Prime
Rate was 3.25%.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance Subject to Interest Rate:

We use a method called ""daily balance (including new purchases)"". To determine
the amount of the interest to be charged on your Account we first calculate the
""Balance Subject to Interest Rate"" separately for Purchases, for Balance
Transfers, and for Cash Advances.  We apply the applicable DPR to each of the
applicable daily balances for  i) Purchases, ii) Balance Transfers and iii)
Cash Advances.  The daily balances for Purchases, for Balance Transfers and for
Cash Advances are each calculated separately and determined as follows: We take
the beginning balances for each transaction type on your Account each day,
including any interest calculated on the previous day's balance, add to the
respective balances any new transaction, subtract any payments or credits and
make any other applicable adjustment(s). This Agreement provides for
compounding of interest. A credit balance is treated as a balance of zero. If
you multiply the ""Balance Subject to Interest Rate"" for each balance category
as shown on your monthly billing statement by the number of days in the billing
period and then multiply each sum by the applicable DPRs, the results will be
the interest assessed, except for minor variations caused by rounding.  We may
from time to time offer you ""introductory,"" ""special"" or ""promotional"" APR
offers. If any are in effect on your Account  we will separately identify the
balances to which such offers apply on your monthly billing statement. These
separate balances and the related interest will be calculated in the same
manner as described above.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance Subject to Interest Rate (For Residents of
Iowa at the Time of Account Opening):

We use a method called ""average daily balance (including new purchases)"".  To
determine the amount of the interest to be charged on your Account we first
calculate the ""Balance Subject to Interest Rate"" separately for Purchases, for
Balance Transfers, and for Cash Advances.  We apply the applicable Monthly
Periodic Rate to the average daily balances of i) Purchases, ii) Balance
Transfers, and iii) Cash Advances. The average daily balances for Purchases,
for Balance Transfers, and for Cash Advances are calculated separately and
determined as follows:  We take the beginning balances for each balance
category on your Account each day, add to the respective balances any new
transaction, subtract any payments or credits and make any other applicable
adjustment(s). A credit balance is treated as a balance of zero. Then we take
the sum of all daily balances and divide by the number of days in the billing
period to determine the average daily balance. If you multiply the ""Balance
Subject to Interest Rate"" for each balance category as disclosed on your
monthly billing statement by the applicable MPRs, the results will be the
interest assessed, except for minor variations caused by rounding. We may from
time to time offer you ""introductory,"" ""special"" or ""promotional"" APR offers.
If any are in effect on your Account we will separately identify the balances
to which such offers apply on your monthly billing statement. These separate
balances and the related interest will be calculated in the same manner as
described above.

Accrual of Interest and How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases.

On Purchases, interest begins to accrue as of the transaction date. However,
you may avoid paying interest on Purchases in any given billing cycle if you
pay your Statement Balance in full by the Payment Due Date each month.  For
Balance Transfers, interest will accrue from the day we send the Balance
Transfer to the payee.  For Checks, interest will accrue on the day the payee
accepts the Check.  For Cash Advances, interest will accrue from the day you
take the Cash Advance.  If you are charged interest in a billing cycle, we will
charge a Minimum Interest Charge (or ""Minimum Charge"") on your Account if the
total interest charge in that billing cycle is less than the amount of the
Minimum Interest Charge that is disclosed in the Account Summary Table.

Using Your Account/Acceptance of These Terms.

You do not need to accept the Account and this Agreement and none of the fees
on this Account (except as otherwise provided herein) will apply unless you use
the Account.  If your Account has an Annual Fee (see the Account Summary Table
to determine if this Account has an Annual Fee) and provided that you have not
otherwise used the Account to make a Purchase, Balance Transfer or Cash Advance
or paid the Annual Fee, you may close the Account within thirty days after
Account opening by contacting us at the number on the back of your Card, and if
you do, you will not be responsible for paying the Annual Fee.  By signing,
keeping, using or otherwise accepting your Card or Account, you agree to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. You may obtain credit in the form of
Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances by using your Card, your account
number, Checks, or other credit devices. You agree that we may credit your
Account rather than issue cash refunds when you reverse transactions that were
originally charged to your Account. You agree that you will not use your Card
or Account in connection with any transaction that is prohibited or
unenforceable and that if you do engage in such a transaction you waive any
claim that the charge is uncollectible on the grounds the transaction was
prohibited or unenforceable. The Card must be returned to us upon request. We
may replace your Card with another Card at anytime.

Obligations on Your Account.

You authorize us to pay and charge your Account for all Purchases, Balance
Transfers, Checks, and Cash Advances made or obtained by you or anyone you
authorize to use your Card or Account. You agree to pay us for all of these
Purchases, Balance Transfers, Checks, and Cash Advances, plus any interest
assessed on your Account and any other charges and fees which you may owe under
the terms of this Agreement, whether resulting from 1) physical use of your
Card or a Check, 2) mail order or telephone, computer or other electronic
transaction made without presenting the Card, or 3) any other circumstances
where you authorize a charge, or authorize someone else to make a charge, to
your Account. Instructions for making payments are on your monthly billing
statement. Payments that comply with the requirements specified on or with your
monthly billing statement, including the time of receipt, will be credited on
the business day they are received. Payments must be mailed to the correct P.O.
Box or street address specified for U.S. Priority Mail and overnight payments.
There may be a delay of up to five (5) days in crediting payments that are not
made in accordance with those instructions. Please allow at least seven (7)
days for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver your payment. All payments must be
made in U.S. dollars. Any payment made by check or other negotiable instrument
or direct debit must be drawn on a U.S. bank or a U.S. branch of a foreign
bank. We reserve the right to accept payments made in a foreign currency. If we
do, we will select the foreign currency rate at our discretion. Your available
credit may not be immediately increased by the amount of the payment for up to
seven (7) days to ensure we collect the funds from the bank on which your
payment is drawn. If you overpay or if there is a credit balance on your
Account, we will not pay interest on such amounts.

Credit Line/Authorized Usage.

Your credit line is shown on the folder containing your Card. We may change
your credit line from time to time-either increase or decrease it-in our sole
discretion. If at any time (including in the first month after your Account is
opened) you engage in account actions or activity that we perceive could have a
negative impact on your credit standing with us, we may decrease your credit
line or close your Account. Your latest credit line will appear on your monthly
billing statement. You agree not to make a Purchase, authorize a Balance
Transfer, use a Check, or obtain a Cash Advance that would cause the unpaid
balance of your Account to exceed your credit line. We may honor Purchases,
Balance Transfers, Checks and/or Cash Advances in excess of your credit line at
our sole discretion. If we do, this Agreement applies to that excess and you
agree to pay the excess immediately if we request that you do so. You agree
that we may change or cancel your credit line at any time for any reason
without affecting your obligation to pay amounts that you owe under this
Agreement.  We will notify you of any change, but that change many take effect
before you receive the notice. We may designate that only a portion of your
credit line is available for Cash Advances. If we do and you exceed your line,
you will be considered to have exceeded your credit line for all purposes of
this Agreement. We may limit the authorizations to make Purchase, Balance
Transfer, Check, or Cash Advance transactions that may be accomplished with
your Card or Account.  If you are approved for an account that does not have a
preset spending limit please see the Addendum to the Cardmember Agreement
addendum for additional information about your credit line and the usage of
your Account.

Checks on Your Account.

We may issue Checks on your Account in the form of ""Balance Transfer Checks"" or
""Cash Advance Checks,"" which can be used to access your credit line.   Each
Check will contain your Account number and may be used only by the person(s)
whose name(s) is/are printed on it.  Each must be completed and signed in the
same manner as a regular personal check. If we provide Checks to you, you may
not use them to pay any amount you owe under this Agreement or under any other
account you may have with us. Balance Transfer Checks and Cash Advance Checks
are subject to the same rate and other terms under this Agreement as Balance
Transfers and Cash Advances, respectively.  Unless otherwise indicated, all
references in this Agreement to Balance Transfers include Balance Transfer
Checks, all references to Cash Advances include Cash Advance Checks, and all
references to use of the Account include use of these Checks.  At our sole
discretion we may elect to not honor a Check if there has been a change in your
credit worthiness, your account is not in good standing or if the Check may
cause your account to exceed the Cash Advance or other applicable credit line
on your Account.  At our sole discretion we may elect to honor a Check after
its expiration date. Unlike purchase transactions, there are no charge back
rights with regard to Balance Transfer and Check transactions.

Monthly Billing Statements.

At the end of each monthly billing cycle a statement will be mailed or
delivered to you if your Account has a debit or credit balance of more than
$1.00 or if interest or a fee has been imposed. We will not send a monthly
billing statement if we deem your Account uncollectible or if delinquency
collection proceedings have been instituted by us sending your Account to an
outside collection agency or attorney for collection.

Your Minimum Payment Each Month.

Each billing cycle, you must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due shown on your
monthly statement by its Payment Due Date.  If the Statement Balance shown on
your monthly statement is less than $15, your Minimum Payment Due (due by the
Payment Due Date) will be that Statement Balance amount. Otherwise, if your
Statement Balance is equal to or greater than $15, your Minimum Payment Due
will be the greater of $15 or the total of (1) 1% of the Principal Balance
(defined as the total Statement Balance minus any interest charges, Returned
Payment Fees, and Late Payment Fees that are incurred during the current
billing cycle), plus (2) interest charges incurred during the current billing
cycle plus (3) any Returned Payment Fees and any Late Payment Fees incurred
during the current billing cycle, plus (4) if we so elect, any amount past due
and/or amount over your credit line at the time of billing. In certain
instances your Minimum Payment Due may be less than your total fees and
interest assessed in that billing cycle. At any time you may pay more than the
Minimum Payment Due up to the full amount you owe us, however you cannot ""pay
ahead"".  This means that if you pay more than the required Minimum Payment Due
in any billing cycle or if you make more than one payment in a billing cycle,
you will still need to pay the next month's required Minimum Payment Due by
your next Payment Due Date.

Transaction Fees.

If you use your Card or Account to obtain a Cash Advance, we will charge a Cash
Advance Fee for each such Cash Advance. If you use your Card or Account to do a
Balance Transfer, we will charge a Balance Transfer Fee for each such Balance
Transfer. If you use your Card or Account to purchase Cash Equivalents, we will
charge a Cash Advance Fee (sometimes we may refer to this as a Cash Equivalent
Fee) for each such transaction. If you use your Card or Account for a Foreign
Transaction, we will charge a Foreign Transaction Fee for each such
transaction. Balance Transfer Checks and Cash Advance Checks are subject to the
same Transaction Fee as Balance Transfers and Cash Advances, respectively.  The
present amounts of those charges are stated in the Account Summary Table.

Account Fees.
In addition to the fees listed in the Account Summary Table, we may also assess
the Account Fees listed below.

Annual Fee  - If your account has an Annual Fee, generally it will be billed at

Fee, if there is one on your Account, is listed in the Account Summary Table.

Late Payment Fee - If we do not receive a payment from you in at least the
amount of your Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date shown on your
monthly statement, we may charge you a Late Payment Fee.  The amount of the
Late Payment Fee will be determined in accordance with applicable law.  Thus,

If you pay late again within six billing cycles, the fee will not exceed $29.

Late Payment Fee for Residents of Iowa at the Time of Account Opening -  If we
do not receive a payment from you in at least the amount of your Minimum

determined in accordance with applicable law.   Thus, the fee generally will be
the amount of the applicable Minimum Payment Due or $15, whichever is less.

Returned Payment Fee -  If your bank does not honor a check or direct debit you
deliver to us, or we must return a check because it is not signed or is
otherwise irregular, we may charge you a Returned Payment Fee. The amount of
the Returned Payment Fee will be determined in accordance with applicable law.
Thus, the fee generally will not exceed the amount of the applicable Minimum
Payment Due or $20, whichever is less.

Returned Payment Fee for Residents of Iowa at the Time of Account Opening -  If
your bank does not honor a check or direct debit you deliver to us, or we must

be the amount of the applicable Minimum Payment Due or $15, whichever is less.

Returned Check Fee  -  If we return a Convenience Check (which includes a
Balance Transfer Check or a Cash Advance Check) unpaid because it exceeds your
available credit line at the time it is processed, your Account is closed or
otherwise does not have charge privileges, you did not comply with our
instructions regarding the Check or your Account is past due, we may charge you
a Returned Check Fee.  The amount of the Returned Check Fee will be determined
in accordance with applicable law.  Thus, the fee generally will not exceed the
amount of the returned Check or $20, whichever is less.

Returned Check Fee for Residents of Iowa at the Time of Account Opening -  If

Foreign Currency Conversion.

We and MasterCard (or their affiliates) will convert transactions in foreign
currencies into U.S. Dollars. MasterCard will use their currency conversion
procedures that are current at the time of the transaction. Currently, the
currency conversion rate they use is either the wholesale market rate or the
government-mandated rate in effect under those procedures increased by one
percent. The currency conversion rate used on the conversion date may differ
from the rate in effect on the date you used your Card or Account.

Please take the time to familiarize yourself with your Agreement and retain it for future reference.
Thank you for being an HSBC Cardmember. We appreciate your business.
AGREEMENT TO TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
This Cardmember Agreement and Additional Disclosure Statement as presently set forth, and as they may be amended, govern the open end line of credit we have established for you (your “Account”). We refer to these documents jointly as your “Cardmember Agreement” or “Agreement”. “You” and “your” refer to all persons who applied for the Account or are contractually liable through any other means. “We,” “us,” and “our” refer to HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. “Card” means any credit card, your assigned Account number and any other access devices issued under this Agreement. “Network” means Visa International, MasterCard International Incorporated, Discover Financial Services LLC, American Express or other governing credit card network, as applicable. You and we are bound by this Agreement from the earlier of the time you receive it or from the date of the first transaction, including, without limitation, the placement or posting of any Annual Fee or Periodic Membership Fee on your Account. You may close your Account before using it without paying any Annual Fee, or Periodic Membership Fee if applicable to your Account, when you call us within 90 days of your Account open date at the customer service number on the back of your Card.
USING YOUR ACCOUNT
Account Use Restrictions
You agree to use your Account only for personal, family, household, or charitable purposes. You agree not to use your Account to make payments to us or to any of our affiliates. You agree to use your Account only for valid and lawful purposes. If your Account is used for any other purposes, you are responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us and the Network for all resulting amounts and expenses. You are not authorized to use your Account for any internet gambling transactions, even if otherwise lawful and enforceable.
Types of Account Transactions
You can access your Account using your Card or by other means approved by us to make purchases, receive cash advances, or make balance transfers. We may limit the dollar amount and/or frequency of any type of transaction without notice to you.
Additional Cards
You may request additional Cards on your Account for yourself or others and you may permit authorized users to have access to the Card or Account number. You are personally responsible for each use of each Card issued on your Account according to the terms of this Agreement. If you permit authorized users to have access to your Account, you must pay us for all charges incurred by those persons, including charges for which you may not have intended to be responsible. You must notify us to revoke an authorized user's permission to use your Account. If you do so, we may close your Account and issue a new Card or Cards with a different Account number. You are responsible to recover from that authorized user and destroy any Cards, checks and other devices that can be used as a means of accessing your Account.
Your Credit
Credit Limit 
The Card must be signed to be used. Whether you sign the Card or not, you are fully responsible for complying with all the terms of this Agreement. We will advise you of the total credit limit on your Account when we first send you your Card. All or a portion of your total credit limit is available for cash advances. Your total credit limit and cash advance limit may change from time to time. We will notify you of any such changes through your billing statement or by sending you a separate notice. If no separate cash advance limit is listed on your billing statement, then the amount of your credit limit available for cash advances is your total credit limit.
You agree not to allow your unpaid balance (including Interest Charges and other charges) to exceed your total credit limit. We may elect not to extend credit if you have exceeded your total credit limit or if the amount requested would cause you to exceed your total credit limit. If you exceed your total credit limit, you agree to pay us that excess amount immediately.
Your available credit for purchases and your available credit for cash advances may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days.
Credit Authorizations
Some transactions may require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. We may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We may refuse to authorize any transactions at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for refusal or failure by any merchant to accept or honor your Card, or if a transaction cannot be completed for technical or other reasons.
PAYMENT
Promise to Pay
You promise to pay according to the terms of this Agreement for all: (a) credit we extend on your Account; (b) Interest Charges, and other fees and charges; and (c) collection costs and attorneys' fees to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
If your Account is a joint Account, each joint Accountholder is jointly and individually responsible for all amounts due under this Agreement regardless of death, divorce, other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between you. If any joint Accountholder requests to not be liable for future transactions, we may close the Account.
Payment
Each periodic billing statement you receive from us will identify a Minimum Payment Due. The Minimum Payment Due calculation is disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement.
Recurring Transactions
If you authorize a third party to bill charges on a recurring basis to your Account, we may (but are not required to) provide such third party with your current Account status, Account number and/or expiration date to permit that party to continue billing your Account. We may take such steps even if your Account number changes or if we issue a renewal or replacement Card. To withdraw authorization for a recurring charge in such a case, you must notify the third party. If you default, if a Card is lost or stolen, or if we change your Account or Account number for any reason, we may refuse or suspend recurring charges; in such case you will be responsible for making arrangements to reinstate the recurring charge arrangement and/or for making other payment arrangements.
Timing and Form of Payments
You agree to pay at least the Minimum Payment Due in time to be credited to your Account as of the Payment Due Date. Instructions for making payments are on your billing statement. For a payment to be credited to your Account as of a particular day, we must receive your payment by the date and time and in the manner shown in those instructions. You may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due, and you may pay the entire New Balance at any time.
All payments must be in U.S. dollars. Except for disputed payments, if you pay by mail the payment must be sent to the address shown on your billing statement. If you pay by negotiable instrument, such as a money order or check, it must be in a form that is acceptable to us and must be drawn on a U.S. financial institution. Any check, money order or other instrument tendered as an accord and satisfaction, or which includes a condition, restrictive endorsement or any statement to the effect that acceptance of such instrument shall constitute full or partial satisfaction of a disputed or undisputed debt (collectively, a “Condition”) must be sent to the inquiry address shown on your billing statement. You must note conspicuously on the face of the payment instrument that it is tendered for this purpose. We reserve the right to refuse to accept any payment that is subject to a Condition. If the payment does not comply with the foregoing and we process it, we will not be bound by the Condition.
By sending us a check for payment on your Account, you authorize us to initiate an electronic funds transfer from your bank or other financial institution account according to the terms of the check. This means that your check will be converted to an electronic transaction and your original check will not be returned to you by your bank. Your original check will be destroyed. Your checking or other financial institution account may be debited the same day we receive your check. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic funds transfer, please call customer service at the phone number on the back of your Card. When you use our optional payment by phone service, you authorize us to initiate an electronic funds transfer from your designated bank account or to process the payment as a check transaction. You authorize the amount and timing of each payment. Please retain this authorization for your records.
Application of Payments
We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your Account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances.
INTEREST RATES AND FINANCE CHARGES
Interest Rates
The APRs on your Account are either fixed or variable rates as indicated on the Additional Disclosure Statement. The APR is divided by 365 and rounded to the next highest hundred thousandth of a percentage point to determine your Daily Periodic Rate. The Daily Periodic Rate is used to determine the amount of periodic Interest Charges. Variable rates are determined by adding a specified amount (“Spread”) to an Index (described below).
Index For Variable Rate Accounts
Monthly Index Information
For each billing cycle, variable APRs are calculated by adding a specified amount (“Spread”) to the U.S. prime rate published in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal  that is in effect on the last day of the month (“Prime Rate”). If the Prime Rate changes, the new APRs will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle beginning in the next month.
An increase in the Prime Rate will increase your applicable Daily Periodic Rates which may increase the Interest Charge due on your Account and may increase the Minimum Payment Due. Each time any APR changes, we will apply it to any applicable balances. If a different Index is applicable to your Account, the Index will be disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement.
Purchase APR
The Spread (for variable rates), APR and corresponding Daily Periodic Rate are disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement.
Balance Transfer APR
The Spread (for variable rates), APR and corresponding Daily Periodic Rate are disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement. Balance transfers may not always be available.
Cash APR
The Spread (for variable rates), APR and corresponding Daily Periodic Rate are disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement.
Penalty APR
The Spread (for variable rates), APR and corresponding Daily Periodic Rate are disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement.
Your APRs may increase to the Penalty APR if you fail to make a minimum payment to us when due.
In determining whether to apply your Penalty APR, we may consider the following factors: how long your Account has been open, the existence, seriousness or timing of the defaults on your Account or any other account you have with us; other indications of your Account usage and performance; information about your other relationship(s) with us or any of our related companies; and information we obtain from consumer credit reports obtained from consumer reporting agencies.
If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the Penalty APR goes into effect. If you make the next six consecutive minimum payments once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APRs applicable to your Account. If you do not make these six consecutive minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.­
­Promotional or Introductory APR
At our discretion, we may offer you a Promotional or Introductory APR for any type of transaction. Any Promotional or Introductory APR offer will be subject to the terms of the offer and this Agreement.
Additional APRs
See the Additional Disclosure Statement for any additional APRs that may be applicable to your Account.
Interest and Finance Charges
All Interest and Finance Charges will be added to the purchase balance, unless otherwise specified.
Please see the Additional Disclosure Statement for applicability and amount of the following Interest and Finance Charges.
Minimum Interest Charge. The Minimum Interest Charge is the minimum amount of interest that will be assessed in any billing cycle in which a periodic Interest Charge is payable.The Minimum Interest Charge will be allocated to each category of transactions containing balances subject to an Interest Charge.
How Periodic Interest Charges are Calculated. Periodic Interest Charges are added to the Account when we apply the applicable APR to the balances on the billing statement. We do this by multiplying the Average Daily Balance for each type of transaction shown on your billing statement (for example, purchases, balance transfers, cash advances) by the applicable Daily Periodic Rate. We then multiply the result by the number of days in the billing cycle. Periodic Interest Charges will be calculated using the Daily Periodic Rate in effect on the billing statement closing date.
How Average Daily Balance is Determined. To calculate the Daily Balances, we take the beginning balance for each type of transaction every day, add any new transactions, any previous day’s periodic Interest Charges, any Finance Charges, any fees and charges, and subtract any payments and/or credits and make any necessary adjustments. If a transaction posts after the beginning of a billing cycle, but the transaction occurred prior to the beginning of that billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance and any related Interest Charge calculations may be adjusted to include the transaction amount as of the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction posts. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original payment or transaction. To calculate the Average Daily Balance, we add the Daily Balances for each day of the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle.
How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases (Grace Period on Credit Card Purchases). Periodic Interest Charges begin to accrue on the date of the transaction and continue to accrue until your balance is paid in full. However, if you pay your entire New Balance by the Payment Due Date in the previous month, you can pay your current month's New Balance within at least 23 days (unless otherwise disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement) of the Statement Date without being charged interest on your purchases.
Paying Interest on Other Transactions (No Grace Period on other transactions). There is no grace period for other transactions including cash advances, balance transfers and credit card checks, unless otherwise disclosed. Periodic Interest Charges begin to accrue on the date of the transaction, and continue to accrue until payment in full is credited to your Account.
Changing Your Billing Cycle. Any request to change your billing cycle date is subject to our approval. You agree that changes based on your request may shorten any Grace Period you may have or increase the time period for which periodic Interest Charges may accrue.
Balance Transfer Fee Finance Charges. Balance Transfers include balance transfers and credit card checks. A Balance Transfer Fee Finance Charge will be assessed on the amount of each balance transfer and credit card check as of the date the transaction posts to your Account and will be added to that transaction balance.
Cash Advance Fee Finance Charges. Cash advances include all advances to get cash over the counter, through an ATM, or other “cash-like” transactions (such as purchasing a money order, traveler's check, casino betting chip, or a lottery ticket) as determined by us. A Cash Advance Fee Finance Charge will be assessed on the amount of each cash advance as of the date the transaction posts to your Account and will be added to the Cash balance.
Foreign Transaction Fee Finance Charge. A Foreign Transaction Fee Finance Charge may be assessed on the U.S. dollar amount of transactions made in a foreign currency, as of the transaction date. The Foreign Transaction Fee assessed on purchases will be added to the purchase balance, and the Foreign Transaction Fee assessed on cash advances will be added to the Cash balance.
If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be converted by the Network, into a U.S. dollar amount in accordance with its operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time the transaction is processed. Currently, Network regulations and procedures provide that the currency conversion rate to be used is either (1) a wholesale market rate, or (2) a government-mandated rate in effect on either (i) the applicable central processing date, or (ii) one day prior to the processing date. The currency conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction or posting date. The Network may change the procedures, from time to time, at its own discretion.
See the Additional Disclosure Statement for any additional Interest and Finance Charges that may be applicable to your Account.
If the imposition of any fee amount specified in your Additional Disclosure Statement would exceed limits established by applicable law, we reserve the right to impose the maximum ­­allowable fee, without waiving our right to impose the full specified fee amount thereafter.
ACCOUNT FEES AND OTHER CHARGES
Please see the Additional Disclosure Statement for amounts of the following fees and other charges. All such fees and other charges will be added to the purchase balance, unless otherwise specified. If the imposition of any fee amount specified in your Additional Disclosure Statement would exceed limits established by applicable law, we reserve the right to impose the maximum allowable fee, without waiving our right to impose the full specified fee amount thereafter.
Annual Fee/Periodic Membership Fee
If your Account is subject to an Annual Fee or Periodic Membership Fee, you agree to pay this fee each year (or other periodic assessment if indicated on the Additional Disclosure Statement) your Account is open, or closed with a balance. You agree that this fee will be charged to your Account.
If you close your Account within the first 90 days your Account is open, the Annual Fee/Periodic Membership Fee(s) are refundable so long as you have not used the Account. The Annual Fee/Periodic Membership Fee compensates HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. in part, for Cardmember services provided or made available to you throughout the membership year.
Late Payment Fee
A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, and any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
Over the Credit Limit Fee
If you choose over the credit limit coverage, an Over the Credit Limit Fee may be assessed if the Account balance exceeds the total credit limit at any time during a billing cycle.
Returned Payment Fee
A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. cash advance, purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
Payment By Phone Fee
A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment is requested.
Stop Payment Fee
A Stop Payment Fee may be added to the cash advance balance when a payment of a credit card check is stopped at your request. Payment may be stopped on a credit card check by notifying us in writing or by calling us at the telephone number listed on the Account billing statement, so long as such check has not already been processed. A stop payment request must include the check number, payee, amount, and date of the credit card check on which payment is to be stopped. If a stop payment is requested by telephone, the call must be confirmed in writing within 14 days. A written stop payment will remain in effect for six months unless renewed in writing.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called �daily balance�. 

During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying 
the periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following 
balance types, as applicable: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or 
special promotions. 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees 
posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type.

may not honor a convenience check (i) if you filed for bankruptcy, (ii) if the check is expired, (iii) if your account is closed, (iv) if the amount of the check would exceed your available 
credit or cash advance limit, or (v) as otherwise stated on your convenience check; and 
� Balance Transfers. If applicable, from time to time, we may offer you the chance to transfer balances from your other credit card accounts to this account. Unless we tell you 
otherwise, we will treat balance transfers as purchases. We reserve the right to decline to process any balance transfer request for any reason, and will not transfer a balance from 
any of our affiliates. Transfers will be processed in the order determined by us. If the amount you wish to transfer is greater than your available credit limit, we may reject the 
request(s). It may take up to four weeks for a balance transfer request to be credited to your other credit card account(s). It is your responsibility to make any payments required to 
keep your other account(s) current and to close your other account(s), if you desire. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur on your other account(s) as a result of 
your balance transfer(s). If you have a dispute with a creditor, and pay the balance in question by transferring it to your account, you may lose certain dispute rights. 

You may use your account only for lawful personal, family or household purposes. You may not use your account for internet gambling or illegal purposes. You may not use your account 
to pay amounts you owe us on this account or on other accounts you have with us. These restrictions are for our benefit, and we are not responsible to you for enforcing them. 

9. CREDIT AND CASH ADVANCE LIMITS. 
A. Assigning Limits. We will assign the following limit(s) on your account, as applicable. We may increase or decrease either or both of these limits at any time. 
Credit Limit � This is the highest amount of total credit we will extend to you on your account. 

Cash Advance Limit � This is the highest amount of credit we will extend to you for cash advances made on your account, if applicable. Cash transactions will also count 
towards your credit limit. 

B. Exceeding Limits. 
We may refuse to authorize you to use your account if that use (including any fees associated with that use) will cause the total you will owe on your account to 
be more than your credit limit. If applicable, you may not get a cash advance if that cash advance (including interest and cash advance fees) will cause the total you will owe for 
cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit. If we approve a transaction that causes the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit 
limit or, if applicable, the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit, we do not give up any of our rights under this Agreement 
and we do not treat it as an increase in your credit limit or, if applicable, cash advance limit. 

C. Limiting Transactions. We reserve the right to not approve transactions on your account. To prevent fraud, we may also limit the number or dollar amount of transactions you can 
make in a particular amount of time. 

10. INTEREST. This section explains (i) the interest rates that will apply to your account, (ii) when interest will be charged on your account, and (iii) how the amount of interest is calculated. 
A. Rates. The following rates apply to purchases and, if applicable, cash advances. A higher rate, which we call a �Penalty APR� may apply at certain times as described below. The 
Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account are shown in the table above and will also be shown on your billing statement. 
We calculate interest on the balance of your account each day. We use a daily rate to calculate the interest each day. The daily rate is equal to the APR divided by 365. 

1. Purchase Rate. The daily rate for purchases is .07394% (APR 26.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
2. Cash Advance Rate. The daily rate for cash advances is .08216% (APR 29.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
3. Penalty Rate. The penalty rate may apply if you do not make your total minimum payment by the payment due date and will continue to apply as provided in this section. As 
required by law, we will provide you with advance notice if we are going to apply the penalty rate to your account and we will tell you when the penalty rate will apply. 
a. What is the Penalty Rate? The daily penalty rate will be .08216% (APR 29.99%). 
b. How Long Will the Penalty Rate Apply? If you are not more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to transactions made on your account after a date 
specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make all required payments by the payment due date for six consecutive billing periods, your rate will return to the 
standard APR; otherwise, the penalty rate will apply indefinitely. 

If you are or become more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to all balances and new transactions on your account not already subject to the penalty 
rate as specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make six consecutive minimum payments by the payment due date, starting with your first payment due 
date after the date specified in the advance notice, your rate for any balances created on your account prior to or within 14 days after the date of the advance notice 
that are not already subject to (or scheduled under a prior notice to be subject to) the penalty rate will return to the standard APR. If you do not make these six consecutive 
minimum payments, we may apply the penalty rate to all balances on your account indefinitely. 

B. When We Charge Interest. 
1. Purchases. We charge interest on your purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full, except as set forth below: 
� We will not charge you interest during a billing cycle on any purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the billing cycle or (ii) you had such a balance, you paid 
that balance in full by the due date in that billing cycle. 
� We will credit, as of the beginning of the billing cycle, any payment you make by the due date that we allocate to purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the 
previous billing cycle, or (ii) if you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in the previous billing cycle. 

2. Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. If applicable, we charge interest on your balance transfers and cash advances (and their related fees) from the date you make the 
transaction until you pay them in full. You cannot avoid paying interest on balance transfers or cash advances or on their fees. 

C. How We Calculate Interest. During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the 
periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types, as applicable: 
purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 
� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract 
any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. We charge a minimum of $2 of 
interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest. 

11. FEES. We may charge some or all of the following fees. The table at the beginning of this Agreement shows the amount of each of the transaction and penalty fees. 
A. Transaction Fees. 
1. A Balance Transfer Fee for each balance transfer you make. 
2. A Cash Advance Fee for each cash advance you get. 

B. Penalty Fees. 
1. A Late Payment Fee if we do not receive at least the total minimum payment due on your account by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the due date shown on your statement. The amount 
of the late payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if you have paid at least your total minimum payment due by the payment due date in each of the prior six billing cycles or 
(2) $35 if you have failed to pay at least the total minimum payment due by the payment due date in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the late 
payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for which the late payment fee is assessed, the amount of the late payment fee will instead be equal to the 
amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 
2. A Returned Payment Fee if any check or other instrument sent to us, or any electronic payment authorization you provide us in payment on your account, is not honored 
upon first presentment, even if the check, instrument or electronic authorization is later honored. The amount of the returned payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if 
your payments have been honored upon first presentment in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any payment has been dishonored upon first presentment in any 
one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the returned payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for the cycle in which the payment was dishonored 
upon first presentment, the amount of the returned payment fee will instead be equal to the amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

C. Other Fees. 
1. A Returned Convenience Check Fee of up to $35 if we do not honor a convenience check because (i) it will cause you to go over your cash advance limit, (ii) you filed a 
petition in bankruptcy, (iii) the check is expired, or (iv) your account is closed. The amount of the returned convenience check fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if your convenience 
checks have been honored in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any convenience check has been dishonored in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. 
However, if the returned convenience check fee would exceed the amount of the dishonored convenience check, the amount of the returned convenience check fee will 
instead be equal to the amount of the dishonored convenience check. 

2. A Stop Payment Fee of $39.99 if we stop payment on any convenience check at your request. 

12. YOUR PAYMENTS. 
A. Required Payment and Crediting of Payment. Each billing cycle you must pay at least the total minimum payment by 5:00 pm (ET) on the payment due date. You may at any 
time pay more than the total minimum payment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payment may reduce the amount of interest you will pay. Any payments received 
after 5:00 pm (ET) will be credited as of the next day. We may delay making credit available on your account in the amount of your payment. 

B. Minimum Payment. Your total minimum payment will be calculated as shown below. We round up to the next highest whole dollar in figuring your total minimum payment. In 
addition, if your new balance on your billing statement is less than $25, then your total minimum payment will be equal to the new balance. Your minimum payment will be: 
1. The sum of the following: 
(a) The greater of either: 
(i) $25; or 
(ii) 5% of the new balance shown on your billing statement (excluding any balance attributable to any special promotion that involves delayed or special 
payments); PLUS 

(b) Any past due amounts; PLUS 
(c) Any payment due in connection with a specific promotional purchase. 

2. If you are charged a late payment fee during a billing cycle, for the next four months, we will make the following calculation each month as long as you make at least the initial 
minimum payment each month. We will calculate if the total of your payments is at least equal to the sum of the following: (A) the interest billed on your statement each month, 
plus (B) 1% of the new balance shown on your billing statement each month (excluding any balance attributable to any special promotion that involves delayed or special 
payments), plus (C) the late payment fee that was assessed in the billing cycle before the four month period. If for the four month period the sum of your payments is not at least 
equal to the sum of A, B and C, then your minimum payment for future billing cycles will be the greater of either: 
(a) the minimum payment calculation shown in (1) above; or 
(b) the sum of: 
(i) 1% of the new balance shown on your billing statement (excluding any balance attributable to any special promotion that involves delayed or special 
payments) plus interest and late payment fees charged to your account in the current billing cycle; PLUS 
(ii) Any past due amounts; PLUS 
(iii) Any payment due in connection with a specific promotional purchase. 

C. How to Make a Payment. To make a payment you must follow all the instructions below and the instructions on your billing statement. If you do not follow these instructions, credit 
of your payment to your account may be delayed up to five days. 
1. Do the following: (a) make your payment in United States dollars by check, money order, or similar instrument from a bank located in the U.S; (b) send the payment coupon 
from your billing statement with your payment; (c) send the payment and payment coupon in the envelope provided with your billing statement to the payment address listed on 
your billing statement; and (d) send only one payment and one payment coupon in each envelope. Alternatively you may make your payment online at the website address 
shown on your billing statement provided you make your payment in United States dollars from a bank located in the U.S. 
2. Do not do the following: (a) staple, paper clip, tape or fold your payment or payment coupon; (b) include any other papers or items with your payment; (c) use a balance 
transfer or convenience check from your account to pay us; or (d) send us cash. 

D. Other Ways to Make a Payment. Certain participating stores or providers may take payments that you make to them as a convenience to you. We may not credit those payments 
to your account until we receive them. We may allow you to make payments over the phone as an accommodation to you, but we may charge you a fee to do so. 

E. Disputed Amounts. If you send us correspondence about a disputed amount, you must send it to the address for billing inquiries shown on your billing statement. 
You may not send it to the payment address shown on your billing statement. By �disputed amount,� we mean a payment of less than the full balance on your account 
that is labeled as �payment in full� or similar language, or is given to us as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, or is given to us with other conditions or limitations. 
We may accept these types of payments without giving up any of our rights. 

F. Authorization. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or 
to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon 
as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. 

G. Payment Allocation. We reserve the right to select the method by which the required minimum payment is allocated to different balances on your account. Some or all of the 
required minimum payment on your account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. The payment allocation method that we use may result in higher 
interest on your account or reduced savings attributable to any special promotions. Any payment you make in excess of the required minimum payment will be allocated to 
balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs, unless applicable law requires or permits otherwise (such as when your account has a certain type of special 
promotion). 

13. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS. At times, we may offer you special promotions when you use your account for certain transactions. These special promotions will have some terms that 
are different from the terms in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement apply to any special promotion, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the special promotion. We 
may terminate your participation in any special promotion and/or apply the penalty rate to your account balances (including special promotion balances) if you become more than 60 days 
late on any payment due on your account. If this happens, each special promotion balance will no longer be subject to the terms of the special promotion and will instead be subject to the 
terms of this Agreement. A promotional charge may be charged as part of a special promotion. Please see any special promotion advertising (including in-store signs) or other disclosures 
provided to you for the full terms of any special promotion offered. 

14. SECURITY INTEREST. You grant us a purchase money security interest in each item of merchandise purchased on your account to secure its unpaid purchase price until such 
merchandise is paid in full. Solely for the purpose of determining the extent of our purchase money security interest in each such item of merchandise, your payments will be allocated 
first to interest on the account, and then to pay off each purchase on the account in the order in which the purchase was made (if more than one item was purchased on the same day, 
your payments will be allocated to pay off the lowest priced item first). If you made a purchase pursuant to a credit promotion, the balance with respect to the promotional purchase may 
be shown on statements during the promotional period and may reflect a different payment allocation method. In no event will we assert a security interest in the promotional purchase for 
an amount greater than the lowest balance shown on a statement for that promotional purchase. We agree that no security interest is or will be retained or acquired under this agreement 
in any real property which is used or is expected to be used as your dwelling. Should we feel it necessary, you authorize us to sign and file financing statements regarding any vehicle 
purchased. 

For some individual purchases under your account, we may require you to maintain property/casualty insurance on the purchase as a condition of granting you credit. You will be 
informed of any property/casualty insurance requirement at the time you make the purchase. 

15. UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should call us immediately at 1-866-396-8254. 
You will not be liable for any unauthorized use on your account. 

You agree that unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given your card or allowed use of your account. You will be responsible for all use by such a 
person. 

16. YOUR CREDIT REPORTS AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION. 
A. Using and Sharing Your Information. When you applied for an account you gave us information about yourself. You also agreed that we could ask others for information about 
your creditworthiness and that we could ask consumer reporting agencies for your consumer report. We use this information in considering your application. We also use this

that accept this credit card (and their affiliates) and you consent to this. Dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals will use the information in connection with the credit 
card program and for things like creating and updating their records and offering you special benefits. We will use information about you and your account as set forth in the privacy policy 
that is attached to or enclosed with this document.

contacting you that may be billed to you by your communications carriers. 

20. TELEPHONE MONITORING. For quality control purposes, you permit us to listen to or record telephone calls between you and us. 

21. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT.

B. When We May Close Your Account. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may close your account at any time and for any reason. 

C. After You or We Close Your Account. 
If you or we close your account, you must stop using it. You will still have to pay us the full amount you owe on your account. This 
Agreement controls your account until you pay it in full. 

22. DEFAULT. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, you are in default if you: 
� Make a late payment; 
� Do not follow any other term of this Agreement; or 
� Become bankrupt or insolvent. 
If you default or upon your death, we may, subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law: (i) make the full amount owing on your account due right away; (ii) bring a legal 

action to collect all amounts owed; and/or (iii) take any action allowed by law. We may also reduce your credit limit or close your account at any time whether or not you are in default. 
23. COLLECTION COSTS. If we ask an attorney to collect your account, we may charge you our collection costs. Collection costs may include court costs, reasonable attorneys� fees 
and fees for repossession, repair, storage and sale of any vehicle securing a purchase. We will charge these costs only if the attorney we ask to collect is not our salaried employee and 
the law allows us to do so.

(i) ACCOUNT 

This is the Agreement that covers your Banco Popular North America MasterCard credit card account 
(called your �Account�) with us. In this Agreement, and in your Account Statements (each, an 
�Account Statement�), the words �you� and �your� refer to all persons named on the credit card 
application, credit card, or acceptance form, as well as their heirs and executors, and the words �we�, 
�us� and �our� and �Bank� refer to Banco Popular North America. 


 

You can use your credit card (�Card�) to purchase goods and services at participating merchants and 
to take Cash Advances as described in this Agreement. You agree not to use your Card for any 
unlawful purpose. If you use, or allow someone else to use, any Card associated with your Account 
for any other purpose, you will be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us and 
MasterCard� International Incorporated (�MasterCard�) for all amounts or expenses either Banco 
Popular North America or MasterCard pays as a result of such use. 

 

(ii) PROMISE TO PAY 

You promise to pay for (a) credit extended by Banco Popular North America, to you or to anyone 
whom you permit to use any Card associated with your Account; (b) INTEREST CHARGES, late 
charges, and any other fees or administrative charges (e.g., returned check charges) provided in this 
Agreement; and (c) collection costs and attorneys' fees as permitted by applicable law if your Account 
should go into default. 

 

(iii) CASH ADVANCES 

The term �Cash Advance� includes the following transactions: (1) Automated Teller Machine (ATM) 
transactions; (2) convenience check transactions; (3) money orders, cashiers checks, travelers 
checks, wire transfers, foreign currency or other in-bank transactions; (4) tax payments; (5) certain 
permitted gambling transactions; and (6) court costs, bail bonds and fines. Convenience checks are 
used the same as personal checks and are drawn from your Account and billed on your monthly 
Account Statement. 

 

(iv) CREDIT LIMIT 

You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases 
and Cash Advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon 
receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each Account 
Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit 
limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you 
exceed your authorized credit limit, the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return 
or forfeit the Card and close the Account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, 
shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized 
credit limit. 

 

(v) INTEREST CHARGES 

Monthly INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on all balances on this Account. The INTEREST 
CHARGE applied to purchases and balance transfers from other institutions will be based on variable 
Annual Percentage Rates (�APR�). This APR can increase or decrease for each billing period. Different 
APRs can apply to purchases, Cash Advances, balance transfers from other institutions, and 
convenience checks. Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for specific APRs related to your 
Account. 

Variable APRs will be determined by adding the United States Prime Rate as published in The Wall 
Street Journal (�Prime Rate�) to a margin. There is no pre-set limit on rate increases. The amount of 
your margins and current APRs are disclosed in the accompanying card mailer. We determine the 
margins applicable to your Account based on your credit history at the time of approval of your Card 
application. An increase in the Prime Rate will cause an increase in your APR, the INTEREST CHARGE 
and your minimum payment. 

The �Daily Periodic Rate� is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances and is determined 
by dividing the APR by 365 and rounding up. For each billing period, the APR will be based on the 
Prime Rate published two business days prior to the Account Statement/closing date for that billing 
period. In the event the Prime Rate is not available as of that date, we may substitute a similar 
published rate that is outside of our control. To the extent permitted by law, any change in your APR 
will apply to the existing balance on your Account and to new transactions. 

The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances. The INTEREST 
CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the 
number of days in the billing period. 

The Average Daily Balance for purchases is obtained by taking into account the initial daily balance on 
purchases, plus any new purchases, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on purchases, and any 
other fees and charges that we add that day, minus any payments and credits we apply to the 
purchase balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the 
total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. New purchases are added to the daily 
balance on posting date, unless we elect to use a later date. Purchases will begin to accrue INTEREST 
CHARGE on the date of posting. No INTEREST CHARGE will be imposed on a purchase added to your 
daily balance during the billing cycle covered by the Account Statement if that Account Statement 
shows no previous balance or shows that the previous balance was paid in full by its payment due 
date. Also, no additional INTEREST CHARGE will be charged on any purchases included in the new 
balance of a monthly Account Statement if you pay the new balance in full on or before the date 
specified in your Account Statement. The payment due date will be 25 days or more, depending upon 
the payment due date on your Account. 

The Average Daily Balance for Cash Advances is obtained by taking into account the initial daily 
balance on Cash Advances, plus any new Cash Advances, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on 
Cash Advances, and any other Cash Advance fees that we add that day, minus any payments and 
credits we apply to the Cash Advance balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing 
period are added and the total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. The INTEREST 


CHARGE on Cash Advances, balance transfers and convenience checks will be imposed from the date 
the transaction is conducted. There is no �free ride� period for such transactions. 

Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for other terms which are made a part of this 
Agreement. 

 

(vi) ANNUAL FEE 

If applicable, the annual fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is 
issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the first Card. Please refer to the 
accompanying card mailer for specific annual fee information related to your Account. 

 

(vii) MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 

We will not impose any late charges or penalty fees if you pay at least the minimum payment 
reflected on your Account Statement by the specified �Payment Due� date. If you wish, you may pay 
more than the minimum payment and at any time you may pay the entire amount due for the current 
billing cycle. Send payments to Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 
2938, Milwaukee, WI 53201-2938. 

 

Your payment will be credited as of the day we receive it, subject to any applicable cutoff hour. The 
new cutoff time for payments received by mail, telephone and other electronic means is 5:00 p.m. 
Central Time. We offer the convenience of online payments. Please visit www.mypopularcards.com to 
set up an account and avail of this free online payment service. Payments received by 5:00 pm CST, 
Monday through Friday, will be processed the same day. Online payments received on Saturday, 
Sunday or a Bank holiday will be processed the next business day. If the payment is made at a Bank 
branch during business hours in cash or with a check drawn against the Bank, it will be processed the 
same day. Credit for any other payments may be delayed five (5) business days during which interest 
will not accrue. If your payment due date falls on a weekend or legal federal holiday, the payment 
received will be credited to the account on the next business day and will not be considered late. If your 
payment is received after the payment cutoff time on the due date or any time thereafter, a late 
payment fee will be charged to your Account. Please refer to the back of your card mailer for more 
details regarding the minimum monthly payment and other important terms applicable to your Account. 

 

(viii) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS 

If you pay the required minimum payment of the monthly Account Statement, the payment shall be 
applied in the following way: first to INTEREST CHARGES and the rest shall be applied first to the 
debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances, with the lowest APR and then to the debt with the 
higher APR in ascending order. Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until 
the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required 
payment, the excess shall be applied first to the debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances 
with the highest APR and then to the debt with the lowest APR in descending order. 

 

All payments by mail must be made by check or money order. Payments may not be made by 
attempting to effect a transfer or by using a convenience check from this Account or from any other 
Banco Popular North America credit card account. You agree that any payment you make may be, 
but is not required to be, returned to you without applying it to your Account and without 
presentment or protest, for reasons including, but not limited to, that the check or money order: (1) 
is missing a signature; (2) is drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (3) contains a 
restrictive endorsement; (4) is post dated; (5) is not payable to Banco Popular North America; (6) is 
not payable in U.S. dollars; (7) is not paid upon presentment; or (8) results from an attempted 
transfer or is drawn on a convenience check. You agree to pay any Bank collection fees we incur for 
any check payments made in U.S. dollars drawn on a financial institution not located in the United 
States. All payments made by mail under this Agreement must be received at the address specified 
on your Account Statement. 

 

Any conditional check, money order or any other instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a 
disputed debt or as an accord and satisfaction or containing a restrictive endorsement must be sent 
to us at the Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 2938, Milwaukee, 
WI 53201-2938. You must note conspicuously on the face of the payment that it is tendered for this 
purpose. If you make a payment in any other manner and we accept it, we will not have waived our 
rights to collect any amounts owed under this Agreement. Even though your payment may be posted 
to your Account, we may not restore your available credit or Cash Advance available credit 
immediately. 

 

(ix) MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENT 

The Bank shall mail to you a monthly Account Statement at the end of each billing period in which 
you have a balance in excess of $1. You must notify the Bank, in writing, of any error in the Account 
Statement, within sixty (60) days, following the date on which the Account Statement was mailed. 

 

(x) FEES 

Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

a. Penalty fee: A late fee will be added to the standard purchase balance for each billing period you 
fail to pay by its due date the minimum payment due. Returned payment fees may also be charged. 

 

b. Currency conversion fee: If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, other than a cash 
advance made at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, MasterCard will convert the charge into a U.S. 
dollar amount. MasterCard currently uses a conversion rate in effect one day prior to its transaction 
processing date. Such rate is either a wholesale market rate or the government-mandated rate. 
Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

 


If you make a Cash Advance in a foreign currency at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, the 
amount is converted into U.S. dollars by our affiliate in accordance with its foreign currency 
conversion procedures then in effect. Our affiliate currently uses a conversion rate in effect on its 
applicable processing date. Such rate is either a mid-point market rate or the government-mandated 
rate. 

 

The foreign currency conversion rate in effect on the applicable processing date for a transaction may 
differ from the rate in effect on the sale or post date on your Account Statement for that transaction. 

 

If a transaction is converted by a third party prior to such transaction being processed by MasterCard, 
the foreign currency conversion rate for that transaction will be the rate selected by that third party. 

 

c. Administrative charges: We may charge you a fee to take advantage of certain optional 
administrative services we provide our Cardmembers such as copy of Account Statements, additional 
credit cards or express delivery services. Each time an administrative service is offered to you, any 
fee for the service will be reflected on your Account Statement. You agree to pay the fee disclosed 
each time you opt to take advantage of an administrative service. These services are optional and are 
not required to be used by you.

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS: Keep this Document for Future Use 

 

This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing 
Act. 

 

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Account Statement 

If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, write to us at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

In your letter, give us the following information: 

� Account information: Your name and account number. 
� Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
� Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, describe what 
you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. 


 

You must contact us: 

� Within 60 days after the error appeared on your Account Statement. 
� At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment 
on the amount you think is wrong. 


 

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not 
required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 

 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 

When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 

1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also 
tell you if we have already corrected the error. 

2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we 
believe the Account Statement is correct. 

 

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 

� We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
� The charge in question may remain on your Account Statement, and we may continue to impose 
INTEREST CHARGES on that amount. 
� While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your 
balance. 
� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 


 

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 

� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any INTEREST CHARGES 
or other fees related to that amount. 



� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with 
applicable INTEREST CHARGES and fees. We will send you an Account Statement of the amount 
you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the 
amount we think you owe. 


 

If you receive our explanation but still believe your Account Statement is wrong, you must write to us 
within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent 
without also reporting that you are questioning your Account Statement. We must tell you the name 
of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when 
the matter has been settled between us. 

 

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you 
question even if your Account Statement is correct. 

 

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Card Purchases 

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your Card and you 
have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay 
the remaining amount due on the purchase. 

 

To use this right, all of the following must be true: 

1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing 
address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. 

(Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to 
you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 

2. You must have used your Card for the purchase. Purchases made with Cash Advances from an 
ATM or with a check that accesses your Account do not qualify. 

3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 

 

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in 
writing at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we 
finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount 
and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

Thank you for being an HSBC Cardmember. We appreciate your business.

You and we are bound by this Agreement from the earlier of the time you receive it or from the date of the first transaction, including, without limitation, the placement or posting of any Annual Fee or Periodic Membership Fee on your Account. You may close your Account before using it without paying any Annual Fee, or Periodic Membership Fee if applicable to your Account, when you call us within 90 days of your Account open date at the customer service number on the back of your Card.
USING YOUR ACCOUNT
Account Use Restrictions
You agree to use your Account only for personal, family, household, or charitable purposes. You agree not to use your Account to make payments to us or to any of our affiliates. You agree to use your Account only for valid and lawful purposes. If your Account is used for any other purposes, you are responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us and the Network for all resulting amounts and expenses. You are not authorized to use your Account for any internet gambling transactions, even if otherwise lawful and enforceable.
Types of Account Transactions
You can access your Account using your Card or by other means approved by us to make purchases, receive cash advances, or make balance transfers. We may limit the dollar amount and/or frequency of any type of transaction without notice to you.
Additional Cards
You may request additional Cards on your Account for yourself or others and you may permit authorized users to have access to the Card or Account number. You are personally responsible for each use of each Card issued on your Account according to the terms of this Agreement. If you permit authorized users to have access to your Account, you must pay us for all charges incurred by those persons, including charges for which you may not have intended to be responsible. You must notify us to revoke an authorized user's permission to use your Account. If you do so, we may close your Account and issue a new Card or Cards with a different Account number. You are responsible to recover from that authorized user and destroy any Cards, checks and other devices that can be used as a means of accessing your Account.
Your Credit
Credit Limit 
The Card must be signed to be used. Whether you sign the Card or not, you are fully responsible for complying with all the terms of this Agreement. We will advise you of the total credit limit on your Account when we first send you your Card. All or a portion of your total credit limit is available for cash advances. Your total credit limit and cash advance limit may change from time to time. We will notify you of any such changes through your billing statement or by sending you a separate notice. If no separate cash advance limit is listed on your billing statement, then the amount of your credit limit available for cash advances is your total credit limit. 
You agree not to allow your unpaid balance (including Interest Charges and other charges) to exceed your total credit limit. We may elect not to extend credit if you have exceeded your total credit limit or if the amount requested would cause you to exceed your total credit limit. If you exceed your total credit limit, you agree to pay us that excess amount immediately.
Your available credit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days.
For Secured Card Accounts Only
Your credit limit may be less than the amount deposited in your HSBC Bank Deposit Account which secures this Account. An increase in your credit limit may be requested at any time, but such increase may be conditioned, at our sole discretion, on additional deposits to your Deposit Account. Any such additional deposits or accumulated interest in your Deposit Account will likewise be subject to this Agreement.
Credit Authorizations
Some transactions may require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. We may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We may refuse to authorize any transactions at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for refusal or failure by any merchant to accept or honor your Card, or if a transaction cannot be completed for technical or other reasons.
PAYMENT
Promise to Pay
You promise to pay according to the terms of this Agreement for all: (a) credit we extend on your Account; (b) Interest Charges, and other fees and charges; and (c) collection costs and attorneys' fees to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
If your Account is a joint Account, each joint Accountholder is jointly and individually responsible for all amounts due under this Agreement regardless of death, divorce, other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between you. If any joint Accountholder requests to not be liable for future transactions, we may close the Account.
Payment
Each periodic billing statement you receive from us will identify a Minimum Payment Due. The Minimum Payment Due calculation is disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement.
Recurring Transactions
If you authorize a third party to bill charges on a recurring basis to your Account, we may (but are not required to) provide such third party with your current Account status, Account number and/or expiration date to permit that party to continue billing your Account. We may take such steps even if your Account number changes or if we issue a renewal or replacement Card. To withdraw authorization for a recurring charge in such a case, you must notify the third party. If you default, if a Card is lost or stolen, or if we change your Account or Account number for any reason, we may refuse or suspend recurring charges; in such case you will be responsible for making arrangements to reinstate the recurring charge arrangement and/or for making other payment arrangements.
Timing and Form of Payments
You agree to pay at least the Minimum Payment Due in time to be credited to your Account as of the Payment Due Date. Instructions for making payments are on your billing statement. For a payment to be credited to your Account as of a particular day, we must receive your payment by the date and time and in the manner shown in those instructions. You may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due, and you may pay the entire New Balance at any time.
All payments must be in U.S. dollars. Except for disputed payments, if you pay by mail the payment must be sent to the address shown on your billing statement. If you pay by negotiable instrument, such as a money order or check, it must be in a form that is acceptable to us and must be drawn on a U.S. financial institution. Any check, money order or other instrument tendered as an accord and satisfaction, or which includes a condition, restrictive endorsement or any statement to the effect that acceptance of such instrument shall constitute full or partial satisfaction of a disputed or undisputed debt (collectively, a “Condition”) must be sent to the inquiry address shown on your billing statement. You must note conspicuously on the face of the payment instrument that it is tendered for this purpose. We reserve the right to refuse to accept any payment that is subject to a Condition. If the payment does not comply with the foregoing and we process it, we will not be bound by the Condition.
By sending us a check for payment on your Account, you authorize us to initiate an electronic funds transfer from your bank or other financial institution account according to the terms of the check. This means that your check will be converted to an electronic transaction and your original check will not be returned to you by your bank. Your original check will be destroyed. Your checking or other financial institution account may be debited the same day we receive your check. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic funds transfer, please call customer service at the phone number on the back of your Card. When you use our optional payment by phone service, you authorize us to initiate an electronic funds transfer from your designated bank account or to process the payment as a check transaction. You authorize the amount and timing of each payment. Please retain this authorization for your records.
Application of Payments
We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your Account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances.
INTEREST RATES AND FINANCE CHARGES
Interest Rates
The APRs on your Account are either fixed or variable rates as indicated on the Additional Disclosure Statement. The APR is divided by 365 and rounded to the next highest hundred thousandth of a percentage point to determine your Daily Periodic Rate. The Daily Periodic Rate is used to determine the amount of periodic Interest Charges. Variable rates are determined by adding a specified amount (“Spread”) to an Index (described below).
Index For Variable Rate Accounts
Monthly Index Information 
For each billing cycle, variable APRs are calculated by adding a specified amount (“Spread”) to the U.S. prime rate published in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal  that is in effect on the last day of the month (“Prime Rate”). If the Prime Rate changes, the new APRs will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle beginning in the next month.
An increase in the Prime Rate will increase your applicable Daily Periodic Rates which may increase the Interest Charge due on your Account and may increase the Minimum Payment Due. Each time any APR changes, we will apply it to any applicable balances. If a different Index is applicable to your Account, the Index will be disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement.
Purchase APR
The Spread (for variable rates), APR and corresponding Daily Periodic Rate are disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement.
Balance Transfer APR
The Spread (for variable rates), APR and corresponding Daily Periodic Rate are disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement. Balance transfers may not always be available.
Cash APR
The Spread (for variable rates), APR and corresponding Daily Periodic Rate are disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement.
Penalty APR
The Spread (for variable rates), APR and corresponding Daily Periodic Rate for the Penalty APR are disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement.
Your APRs on future transactions may increase to the Penalty APR if your Minimum Payment is not received by the Payment Due Date on two occasions in a rolling 12-month period
If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the Penalty APR goes into effect. Your Penalty APR will remain in effect until you make each Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date for 6 consecutive billing cycles. At that time, your APRs will return to the non-penalty APRs applicable to your Account.
Promotional or Introductory APR
At our discretion, we may offer you a Promotional or Introductory APR for any type of transaction. Any Promotional or Introductory APR offer will be subject to the terms of the offer and this Agreement.
Additional APRs
Please see the Additional Disclosure Statement for any additional APRs that may be applicable to your Account.
Interest and Finance Charges
All Interest and Finance Charges will be added to the purchase balance, unless otherwise specified.
Please see the Additional Disclosure Statement for applicability and amount of the following Interest and Finance Charges.
Minimum Interest Charge. The Minimum Interest Charge is the minimum amount of Interest that will be assessed in any billing cycle in which a periodic Interest Charge is payable.The Minimum Interest Charge will be allocated to each category of transactions containing balances subject to an Interest Charge.
How Periodic Interest Charges are Calculated. Periodic Interest Charges are added to the Account when we apply the applicable APR to the balances on the billing statement. We do this by multiplying the Average Daily Balance for each type of transaction shown on your billing statement (for example, purchases, balance transfers, cash advances) by the applicable Daily Periodic Rate. We then multiply the result by the number of days in the billing cycle. Periodic Interest Charges will be calculated using the Daily Periodic Rate in effect on the billing statement closing date.
How Average Daily Balance is Determined. To calculate the Daily Balances, we take the beginning balance for each type of transaction every day, add any new transactions, any previous day’s periodic Interest Charges, any Finance Charges, any fees and charges, and subtract any payments and/or credits and make any necessary adjustments. If a transaction posts after the beginning of a billing cycle, but the transaction occurred prior to the beginning of that billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance and any related Interest Charge calculations may be adjusted to include the transaction amount as of the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction posts. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original payment or transaction.To calculate the Average Daily Balance, we add the Daily Balances for each day of the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle.
How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases (Grace Period on Credit Card Purchases). Periodic Interest Charges begin to accrue on the date of the transaction and continue to accrue until your balance is paid in full. However, if you pay your entire New Balance by the Payment Due Date in the previous month, you can pay your current month's New Balance at least 25 days (unless otherwise disclosed on the Additional Disclosure Statement) of the Statement Date without being charged interest on your purchases.
Paying Interest on Other Transactions (No Grace Period on other transactions). There is no grace period for other transactions including cash advances, balance transfers and credit card checks, unless otherwise disclosed. Periodic Interest Charges begin to accrue on the date of the transaction, and continue to accrue until payment in full is credited to your Account.
Changing Your Billing Cycle. Any request to change your billing cycle date is subject to our approval. You agree that changes based on your request may shorten any Grace Period you may have or increase the time period for which periodic Interest Charges may accrue.
Balance Transfer Fee Finance Charges. Balance Transfers include balance transfers and credit card checks. A Balance Transfer Fee Finance Charge will be assessed on the amount of each balance transfer and credit card check as of the date the transaction posts to your Account and will be added to that transaction balance.
Cash Advance Fee Finance Charges. Cash advances include all advances to get cash over the counter, through an ATM, or other “cash-like” transactions (such as purchasing a money order, traveler's check, casino betting chip, or a lottery ticket) as determined by us. A Cash Advance Fee Finance Charge will be assessed on the amount of each cash advance as of the date the transaction posts to your Account and will be added to the Cash balance.
Foreign Transaction Fee Finance Charge. A Foreign Transaction Fee Finance Charge may be assessed on the U.S. dollar amount of transactions made in a foreign currency, as of the transaction date. The Foreign Transaction Fee assessed on purchases will be added to the purchase balance, and the Foreign Transaction Fee assessed on cash advances will be added to the Cash balance.
If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be converted by the Network, into a U.S. dollar amount in accordance with its operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time the transaction is processed. Currently, Network regulations and procedures provide that the currency conversion rate to be used is either (1) a wholesale market rate, or (2) a government-mandated rate in effect on either (i) the applicable central processing date, or (ii) one day prior to the processing date. The currency conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction or posting date. The Network may change the procedures, from time to time, at its own discretion.
See the Additional Disclosure Statement for any additional Interest and Finance Charges that may be applicable to your Account.
If the imposition of any fee amount specified in your Additional Disclosure Statement would exceed limits established by applicable law, we reserve the right to impose the maximum allowable fee, without waiving our right to impose the full specified fee amount thereafter.
ACCOUNT FEES AND OTHER CHARGES
Please see the Additional Disclosure Statement for amounts of the following fees and other charges. All such fees and other charges will be added to the purchase balance, unless otherwise specified. If the imposition of any fee amount specified in your Additional Disclosure Statement would exceed limits established by applicable law, we reserve the right to impose the maximum allowable fee, without waiving our right to impose the full specified fee amount thereafter.
Annual Fee/Periodic Membership Fee
If your Account is subject to an Annual Fee or Periodic Membership Fee, you agree to pay this fee each year (or other periodic assessment if indicated on the Additional Disclosure Statement) your Account is open, or closed with a balance. You agree that this fee will be charged to your Account.
If you close your Account within the first 90 days your Account is open, the Annual Fee/Periodic Membership Fee(s) are refundable so long as you have not used the Account. The Annual Fee/Periodic Membership Fee compensates HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. in part, for Cardmember services provided or made available to you throughout the membership year.
­Late Payment Fee 
A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
Over the Credit Limit Fee
If you choose over the credit limit coverage, an Over the Credit Limit Fee may be assessed if your Account balance exceeds the total credit limit at any time during a billing cycle.
Returned Payment Fee
A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. cash advance, purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
Payment By Phone Fee
A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment is requested.
Stop Payment Fee
A Stop Payment Fee may be added to the cash advance balance when a payment of a credit card check is stopped at your request. Payment may be stopped on a credit card check by notifying us in writing or by calling us at the telephone number listed on the Account billing statement, so long as such check has not already been processed. A stop payment request must include the check number, payee, amount, and date of the credit card check on which payment is to be stopped. If a stop payment is requested by telephone, the call must be confirmed in writing within 14 days. A written stop payment will remain in effect for six months unless renewed in writing.

creditcardagreement_2936.TXT,"UNFCU VISA Credit Card Agreement

Your use of the United Nations Federal Credit Union (UNFCU)
VISA Student credit card, VISA Classic credit card, VISA Gold
credit card, VISA Elite credit card, and convenience checks is 
governed by this agreement. Therefore, you should read it thoroughly
before you sign or use the card or a convenience check. All transactions, 
fees, charges, and payments are due in US dollars. Your
UNFCU VISA Student credit card, VISA Classic credit card, VISA
Gold credit card and convenience checks, VISA Elite credit card,
may not be used for any illegal transactions.

Definitions

In this VISA credit card agreement, the word ""agreement"" refers to
This VISA Credit Card Agreement, the Credit Card Rates sheet, and
the Schedule of Fees and Service Charges, which constitute the
contract applicable to all transactions on your VISA account, even if
the sales, cash advance or credit slips you sign contain different
terms. The words �you� or �your� mean each applicant to whom a
UNFCU VISA credit card is issued. The words �we,� �us,� and
�ours� mean the United Nations Federal Credit Union. The word
�card� refers to the UNFCU VISA credit card that was sent to you.
This card may be either a VISA Student credit card, VISA Classic
credit card, a VISA Gold credit card or a VISA Elite credit card.
�Account� refers to your VISA credit card account with us, including
but not limited to your convenience checks.

Responsibility

This agreement becomes effective once you sign, activate, or
use your UNFCU VISA credit card and/or convenience check or
fail to return it within five (5) business days. If you do not wish
to be bound by this agreement, do not use or activate the card.
Cut it in half, and return it to us immediately. Otherwise, this
agreement will be deemed to have been accepted by you. If
you do sign the card, you should not use it after the expiration
date printed on the face of the card. You should not use any
convenience check after the expiration date printed on the
check. Use of the account means that you agree to pay all
debts and finance charges arising from the use of the card and
convenience checks, and to be bound by all of the terms and
conditions of this agreement. For example, you are responsible
for all charges made by you, your spouse, minors using this
account, and any other authorized cardholders or users. You are

also responsible for any charges made by anyone else to whom
you have given the card. You and any person who signed the
application for the account, or who accepts, signs, or uses the
card, or uses the account in any way, will be jointly and 
severally liable for payment. This means that we can enforce the entire
payment obligation or any part thereof against any of you individually 
and/or as a group. This agreement will bind and benefit
both parties to it: you and us. It will also bind both parties� legal
representatives, successors, and assigns (your legal 
representatives are those who have a legal right to act for you, 
your successors are those who take your place, and your assigns are
those to whom you transfer your rights and duties). Please note
that you are not permitted to assign or transfer any rights under
this agreement without first obtaining our consent in writing.
Any transfer without our prior written consent is invalid.

Credit Line

If we approve your application, we will establish a credit line (the
total of purchases and cash advances that you are permitted to
have outstanding on your account at any one time).We will notify
you of the amount upon card issuance. This does not create a
loan commitment on our part. You agree not to let the account
balance exceed this approved credit line. Each payment you make
on the account will restore your credit line by the amount of the
payment, which is applied to the principal. We reserve the right to
amend your credit line at any time. By giving you written notice,
we may reduce your credit line or revoke your card and terminate
this agreement. We may take these actions if you are in default, if
you exceed your credit limit, if your creditworthiness changes
adversely, or if you fail to comply with this agreement in any way,
upon your failure to make any loan payment when due on any
loan with UNFCU; if you have made or do make any false or 
misleading statements in furnishing financial and other information
to UNFCU; or if any attachment, execution or other legal process
is issued against any of your property. If you wish to increase your
credit line, you must submit an application to us for approval. You
may at any time terminate this agreement. However, termination
by either you or us does not affect your obligation to pay the balance.
Any card(s) we issue to you shall remain our property, and
you must recover and surrender all cards to us upon termination
of this agreement by either party. You may not transfer loan 
balances to this account from other accounts with us.

Renewal of Card

For your protection, your VISA credit card is issued with an 
expiration date. Upon expiration of your VISA credit card, if your 
accounts active and in good standing, we may automatically issue 
you a renewal card. We may choose not to issue a renewal card if your
account is not in good standing or if UNFCU has other grounds
for termination pursuant to applicable law and this agreement.
Furthermore, UNFCU reserves the right to terminate or not renew
your credit card if there is excessive fraud or abuse of your
account privileges or if you fail to comply with the terms of this
agreement.




Monthly Statement

We will send you a statement each month when there is an
existing balance or any activity on your account. The monthly
statement will show your previous balance of purchases and
cash advances. It will also show the current transactions on your
account, the remaining credit available under your credit line, the
new balance of purchases and cash advances, the total new 
balance, the finance charge due to date, and the minimum payment
due. Every month, you must pay at least the minimum payment
due. You may pay the total amount you owe (total new balance)
or any portion of it, provided you pay us the minimum payment
due. The minimum payment will be either 1) 2% of the total new
balance or 2) 25 USD, whichever is greater, plus 3) any past due
amount(s) shown on previous statement(s), plus 4) any amount
over the credit limit exceeding past due amounts. From time to
time, we may offer certain programmes and/or promotions,
which may reduce the required minimum payment. You may at
any time pay the total indebtedness of this agreement. If at any
time your total new balance exceeds your credit line, you must
immediately pay the excess. Effective 1/18/2010 your total
payment (including the minimum amount and any excess) will be
applied to the balance with the highest APR first, then down to
the balance with the lowest APR. Refunds of excess credit balances
 will be posted to your UNFCU savings account. If you
obtain a refund, adjustment, or credit on a purchase made with
your card, you will receive a credit to your VISA credit card
account, not cash.

Grace Period
Your grace period for the repayment of purchase balances
is twenty five (25) days. You have no grace period for cash
advance balances, convenience checks, or balance transfers.
Finance charges accrue beginning on the cash advance trans
action date.

VISA credit card agreement

Security Interest and Right of Offset
In consideration for UNFCU issuing a VISA credit card to
you, you consent to our right to offset any account payment
delinquency with funds in any of your UNFCU accounts and
that UNFCU will have a security interest in any shares and
deposits in all joint and individual accounts that you and/or any
other person, who is jointly and severally liable under this agreement,
 have with UNFCU now and in the future. This does not
restrict your rights vis � vis your accounts and is not a pledge by
you of the account. Any exercise of this right by us is not an election
 of remedies. Shares and deposits in an Individual Retirement
Account (IRA) and any other account that would lose special tax
treatment under state or federal law if given as security, are not
subject to the security interest you have given in your shares and
deposits. Property given as security for any other loan may
secure all amounts you owe UNFCU now and in the future.

International Transactions

International transactions include any transaction that you
make in a foreign currency or that you make outside of the US
even if it is made in USD. Purchases and cash advances made
in non USD will be billed in USD. VISA converts non USD into
USD according to a wholesale market rate or government
mandated rate in effect on the transaction posting date. VISA
assesses an International Service Assessment (ISA) fee on all
international transactions, which will appear on your billing
statement. UNFCU does not impose any additional fees of its
own for international transactions but reserves the right to do
so in the future.


UNFCU VISA Credit Card Convenience Checks

VISA Credit Card convenience checks are a means to access
your VISA line of credit but are not considered VISA transactions.
Therefore, purchases and payments made using a convenience
check are not subject to the benefits described in the VISA Card
Guide to Benefits (including, but not limited to, price protection
and other chargeback protections afforded to VISA credit card
transactions). Likewise if you have a dispute with a creditor and
pay the balance with a convenience check, you may lose certain
dispute rights. You or an authorized user may use UNFCU VISA
credit card convenience checks issued to you only in the form we
issue them, and only if they bear your or an authorized user�s
name and the account number that is on the card. UNFCU VISA
credit card convenience checks are processed as cash advance
transactions. Transactions will begin to accrue interest the date
that the transaction posts. There is no grace period for cash
advance transactions. To use a convenience check, you must
complete and sign it in the same way you would a regular personal check. 
If the total amount you request exceeds your credit
line, we may either send full or partial payment to your creditors
in the order you provide them to us or we may send you additional 
convenience checks, at our option. You cannot use a convenience 
check to pay any amount you owe UNFCU or any of its
affiliates. We have no obligation to pay a convenience check if you
have breached any of the terms of this card agreement; your
account is past due, over limit, or in default; your check posts after
the void date indicated on the check; your account was not activated 
upon your receipt of your card; your right to use the card has
been revoked or terminated; or if the card is expired or reported
as lost or stolen. We will have no responsibility or liability to you if
we do not pay a convenience check for any of those reasons, or
if we pay postdated convenience checks, or, if by reason of payment 
of any postdated convenience check, (even if we are not
obligated to pay for any of the reasons stated above) a cash
advance results. In the event we do not pay a convenience check
for the reasons stated above and the check is returned, you will be
assessed a returned convenience check fee. Please refer to the
�Schedule of Fees and Service Charges� for further information,
available at  www.unfcu.org, or by calling or writing using the
contact information at the end of this booklet. This fee will be
posted to your account and be subject to finance charges. Paid
convenience checks will not be returned to you with your statement.
 Convenience checks cannot be used until your account
has been activated. Your use or retention of the card and/or 
convenience checks indicates your acceptance and intent to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement.

Authorizations

We are not responsible for the refusal by a merchant or financial
institution to honor your card or convenience checks. Except as
otherwise required by applicable law or regulation, merchandise
or services purchased or leased through use of your account on a
nonrefundable basis at your discretion may not be disputed for
unsatisfactory performance. Although you may have credit avail
able, we may be unable to authorize credit for a particular transaction 
due to operational difficulties or if we suspect fraud or unlawful activity. 
If your account is over limit or delinquent, or if you are
in default under this agreement, authorizations of credit for trans
actions may be declined.

Protecting Your Account

We take fraud prevention very seriously and have implemented
certain fraud detection systems to help protect your UNFCU
VISA Student, VISA Classic credit card, VISA Gold credit card
or VISA Elite credit card from fraudulent activity. This detection
system will monitor your card transactions and detect usage,
which differs from your ordinary spending patterns. If we detect
potential fraud, you may receive an inquiry from us regarding
the account. In certain circumstances, we may block the
account to investigate possible fraud. If we decide to block the
account, we will not be liable to you for any damages suffered
because of the blocking. This added fraud protection feature is
provided at no cost to you and does not affect the way your
card transactions are processed. This is a precautionary measure
 to protect both you and us.

Default and Early Termination

You are in default if you fail to make any minimum payment by
the payment due date shown on your monthly statement. A late
payment fee will be assessed on your account each time you fail
to make the minimum monthly payment by the payment due date.
This fee will be posted to your account balance and be
subject to finance charges. Please refer to the �Schedule of
Fees and Service Charges� for further information, available at
www.unfcu.org, or by calling or writing using the contact
information at the end of this booklet. You will also be in default
if you provide false information on your application, exceed
your credit limit, fail to comply with any term or condition of this
agreement or any other agreement that you make concerning your
account, fail to provide us with updated financial information if
requested, if any government authority takes action which UNFCU
believes adversely affects your financial condition or ability to repay
if you withdraw or transfer from your share accounts any funds
pledged under this agreement or if you file a bankruptcy petition, a
bankruptcy petition is filed against you, you make a general assignment 
for the benefit of creditors or if any of the cardholders dies. If
you are in default, use of the card (which at all times remains our
property) must end immediately, and we may, at our option,
demand immediate payment of the entire amount you owe us.
This amount will include any amounts not yet billed to you and any
finance charge or other fee earned by us, without giving you
notice. In any event, we may demand immediate and complete
payment at any time without cause, unless otherwise provided by
applicable law. In the event of default, you are required to cut the
card in half and return it to us. To the extent permitted by law, you
will also be required to pay our collections expenses including court
costs and reasonable attorney fees. We can accept late or partial
payments, or checks and money orders, marked �paid in full, � or
language having the same intent, without losing any of our rights
under this agreement.

Inactive Accounts

We reserve the right to close your account if it has been inactive
for at least 120 days. This is to protect your account from fraudulent 
use. We will advise you by letter prior to closing and give
you the opportunity to reactivate your account.

Preauthorized Charges

If you default, if your card, convenience check or PIN is lost or
stolen or we change your account or account number for any
reason, we may suspend automatic charges on that account to
third party vendors of other goods or services. If preauthorized
charges are suspended, you must contact the third party vendor
to reinstate them. You are responsible for making direct payment 
for such charges until you reinstate automatic charges.

Finance Charges Calculation

Finance charges are calculated by multiplying the average daily balance 
by the monthly periodic rate as described in the section of
this agreement titled � APR� . This is known as the �average daily
balance� method. The average daily balance is determined by dividing
 the sum of the closing daily balances for each day during the
billing cycle by the number of days in the billing cycle. No finance
charges will be incurred with respect to purchases or other
charges (except cash advances, convenience checks and balance
transfers) during the billing cycle in which they are debited from
the account if the previous balance is zero or shows a credit due to
the member, or if the total amount credited during the billing cycle,
as shown on the billing statement, equals or exceeds the previous
balance. Finance charges will be calculated on the total purchase
balance unless full payment is received within the grace period.
Finance charges on cash advances, convenience checks and balance 
transfers accrue from the date the transaction posts to the
account. There is no grace period for cash advances, convenience
checks, or balance transfers.

Credit Information

You agree that we may request consumer credit reports from
one or more credit reporting agencies when opening, renewing,
reviewing, or administering your account. You also authorize us
to exchange credit information concerning you or your account
with (and answer questions and requests from) others, such as
merchants and credit reporting agencies, concerning your credit
history with us.

Personal Identification Number

We will issue a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to you.
This PIN will allow you to make cash withdrawals. Your PIN is
your secret code. You agree not to disclose your PIN to anyone and
to notify us immediately if you believe your PIN has been stolen.


Liability for Unauthorized Use

If your card(s), convenience check(s) or PIN is lost or stolen, or if
you believe someone may be using your account without your permission, 
you must notify us immediately. You may contact us by
writing to: UNFCU Court Square Place 2401 44th Road Long Island
City, N.Y. 111014605 USA, or by calling us at +1 3476866000, or
toll free within the US/Canada at 18008912471.We may terminate
or limit access to your account if you have notified us or we have
determined that your card, convenience checks and/or PIN may
have been lost or stolen, or that there may be unauthorized access
to your account. You may be liable if there is unauthorized use
before your notice to us. In general, your liability for unauthorized
use of your card before your notice to us will not exceed 50 USD.
The 50 USD limit does not apply for convenience checks and cash
advances. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use of your
card that occurs after you notify us. If you fail to notify us within 60
days from the date a statement was first transmitted to you that
included an unauthorized charge, you may not be reimbursed for
unauthorized transactions that occurred. Failure to promptly notify
UNFCU of unauthorized use may also result in the closing of your
account. We may terminate or limit access to your account if you
have notified us or we have determined that your card, convenience 
checks and/or PIN may have been lost or stolen, or that there
may be unauthorized access to your account.

Inquiries or Questions

You may address any inquiries or questions that you have
about your account to UNFCU Court Square Place 2401 44th

US/Canada at 18008912471. Outside the US and Canada

�Your Billing Rights� section).

Additional Payment Information

Payments accompanied by a payment stub, received at
New York branches and payment made through internet banking, 
Mondays through Fridays excluding UNFCU holidays, will be
posted on the day of receipt provided it is received by 17:00
(5:00 pm) Eastern Standard Time. Although payment made
elsewhere may not be posted on the day of receipt, it will be
posted within five (5) business days thereafter. Cash payments
may be made at the branches only. For your security, please do
not mail in cash payments. Check payments should be mailed
with a payment stub to UNFCU Payment Processing Centre
P .O. Box 9307 Des Moines, IA 50306-9307 .  Automatic payments
 that cannot be processed due to insufficient funds in
your designated UNFCU savings or checking account will result
in an insufficient fund (NSF) fee.



Verification of Identity

Due to recently passed legislation to combat identity theft, you
may experience delays in receiving an additional and/or replacement 
credit card if you recently changed your address or even if
postal mail we sent to you was returned as undeliverable. In
some cases, you will be asked to provide us with additional
information and documentation so that we can verify your identity 
before issuing an additional or replacement card. These
measures are to protect you from identity theft.

How One Section of This Agreement Affects Another

unenforceable under any law, rule, or regulation of any federal,
state, or local government agency will not in any way affect
any other part of this agreement.

notify us in writing and send us the card if you wish to cancel your
account. Your failure to return the card within five (5) business days
of the effective date of the amendment, or your use of the card
thereafter, will indicate your agreement to the amendments. To the
extent permitted by law, amendments may apply to your existing
account balance as well as future transactions.

Miscellaneous

A microfilm or other photographic copy of any sales slip or
similar form showing a purchase, credit voucher, or cash advance
order, as well as any electronic data made on the basis of
the card, will establish the amount you owe us. You agree

microfilm or photographic copies of any sales slip; cash advance
order, credit voucher, or similar form including electronic data that
is not required to be provided to you by law. You agree to give us

1.The purchase must have been made in your home state or within
100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price
must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary 
if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to
you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or 
services.)
2.You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases
made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that
accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3.You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell
you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and
you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.


Annual Percentage Rate (APR)

For new VISA Student, VISA Classic, VISA Gold and VISA Elite
accounts, an introductory APR will be established on the date
your account is opened and remain in effect for the next six
billing cycles. After your sixth billing cycle, your APR is subject
to change based on the Prime Rate as published in the Wall
Street Journal on the last day of the preceding month plus a
margin. If there is more than one Prime Rate published for the
last day of the month, we will use the highest one published.
For VISA Student and VISA Classic, the margin that is used to
determine your APR is 8.65%. For VISA Gold cards, the margin
that is used to determine your APR is 7.65%. For VISA Elite
cards, the margin that is used to determine your APR is 6.65%.
For current rates, please visit www.unfcu.org.
For members paid in local currencies of developing nations, the
APR will be based on the UNFCUVISA Classic credit card rate as
published in the UNFCU rate sheet, plus a margin of 2%. All other
terms regarding the APR for your UNFCUVISA credit card apply.

Annual Fee

For VISA Student, Classic and Gold credit card accounts, there is no
annual fee. For VISA Elite accounts, there is an annual fee of 50
USD. The annual fee will be posted to your account on your first
billing cycle and on each subsequent twelve (12) month anniversary
of your first billing cycle. The annual fee will be posted to your
account balance and be subject to finance charges. UNFCU does
not charge a fee for issuing your VISA card. However, for any VISA
account in which a credit card, whether issued in the name of the
account holder or an authorized user, has been replaced two (2)
times, there is a reissuance fee of 20 USD for each subsequent
replacement.

ATM Safety

Please take appropriate precautions when using ATMs. For tips
on ATM safety, see our website, your UNFCU Membership
Disclosures and Agreements or your Electronic Funds
Transfer booklet.


Priority Pass Use Limitations

Only VISA Elite credit cardholders who are twenty one (21) years of
age or older may be issued a Priority Pass card. The fee for visiting a
Priority Pass lounge is determined by Priority Pass, and will be
charged to your UNFCUVISA Elite Credit Card. This transaction will
be posted as a debit to the purchase balance and is subject to
finance charges. However, when you use your UNFCU VISA Elite
Credit Card to purchase airline tickets, UNFCU will pay for up to four
(4) Priority Pass lounge visits per year per VISA Elite account. Lost or
stolen Priority Pass cards must be reported to UNFCU within
forty eight (48) hours by calling +1 3476866000 or toll free 1800

for cash advances or convenience checks or balance
transfers. VISA reward points or credits may have no monetary
value and may only be used as specified in the VISA Rewards
Program booklet, as amended from time to time. You understand
and agree that any Rewards Program points or credits will be forfeited 
immediately upon closure of the Account by you or us and

CARD AGREEMENT 


This document and the accompanying card carrier together 
make up your Card Agreement and throughout this document 
are referred to as Agreement or Card Agreement. 
The card carrier contains important account information, 
including your annual percentage rates. Please read and 
keep these documents for your records. This Agreement is 
binding on you unless you cancel your account within 30 
days after receiving the card and you have not used or 
authorized use of your account. 

To simplify this Agreement for you, the following definitions 
will apply. The words you, your, and yours mean all persons 
responsible for complying with this Agreement, including the 
person who applied to open the account and the person to 
whom we address billing statements. The word card means 
one or more cards or other access devices, such as account 
numbers, that we have issued to permit you to obtain credit 
under this Agreement. The words we, us, and our mean 
Citibank� (South Dakota), N.A., the issuer of your account. 
The words authorized user mean any person to whom you 
give permission to use your account. 

Using Your Account and Your Credit Line: 

The card must be signed to be used. Whether you sign the 
card or not, you are fully responsible for complying with 
all the terms of this Agreement, including the obligation to 
pay us for all balances due on your account as specified 
in this Agreement. Your card must only be used for lawful 
transactions. 

Your card can be used to buy or lease goods or services 
wherever the card is honored. With the Club Cash� feature, a 
portion of your revolving credit line, called the cash advance 
limit, is available for cash advances through any bank or 
automated teller machine that accepts the card, subject to 
your cash advance limit and subject to a limit on aggregate 
cash advances of $500 per day and $1,000 per week. At 
our discretion, we may change your revolving credit line or 
cash advance limit at any time. We will notify you of any 
new line or limit either by sending you a notice or through 
your billing statement. A change may take effect before you 
receive notification from us. 

In addition, because your account has no pre-set spending 
limit, we may permit you to incur charges that cause your 

New Balance to exceed your revolving credit line. Each 
such charge will be evaluated based on your spending 
and payment patterns and your personal resources. If we 
authorize such charges, you will be required to pay, as 
part of your minimum monthly payment, the amount by 
which your New Balance exceeds your revolving credit 
line, including amounts due to purchases, cash advances, 
finance charges, fees, or other charges. 

Additional Cards: 

You may request additional cards on your account for 
yourself or others and you may permit an authorized user 
to have access to the card or account number. However, 
if you do, you must pay us for all charges made by those 
persons, including charges for which you may not have 
intended to be responsible. You must notify us to revoke 
an authorized user�s permission to use your account. If you 
do so, we may close the account and issue a new card or 
cards with a different account number. You are responsible 
for the use of each card issued on your account according 
to the terms of this Agreement. 

Billing: 

Your billing statement shows the New Balance, any finance 
charges, fees, the minimum payment, and the payment 
due date. It also shows your current revolving credit line 
and cash advance limit; an itemized list of current charges, 
payments and credits; a finance charge summary; and 
other important information. If we deem your account 
uncollectible or if we institute delinquency collection 
proceedings by sending it to an outside collection agency 
or attorney for collection, we may, in our sole billing 
statements. You must notify us of a change in your address 
by contacting Customer Service by telephone or mail. 
We will mail or deliver the billing statement to only one 
address. 

How We Determine the Balance: 

The total outstanding balance (the amount you owe us) 
appears as the �New Balance� on the billing statement. To 
determine the New Balance, we begin with the outstanding 
balance on your account at the beginning of each billing 
period, called the �Previous Balance� on the billing statement. 
We add any purchases or cash advances and subtract 
any credits or payments credited as of that billing 
period. We then add the appropriate finance charges and 
fees and make other applicable adjustments. 

Annual Percentage Rates for Purchases 
and Cash Advances: 

Your annual percentage rates and the corresponding daily 
periodic rates appear on the pricing information table. 
A daily periodic rate is the applicable annual percentage 
rate divided by 365.Whether or not an annual percentage 
rate is based on the U.S. Prime Rate plus a margin is 
indicated on the pricing information table. Please see the 
section entitled �Variable Annual Percentage Rates for 
Purchases and Cash Advances� for details relating to how 
these rates may change. 

Variable Annual Percentage Rates for 
Purchases and Cash Advances: 

If any annual percentage rate is based on the U.S. Prime 
Rate plus a margin, we will calculate the rate for each 
billing period by adding the applicable margin that appears 
on the pricing information table to the U.S. Prime Rate. 
For each billing period we will use the U.S. Prime Rate 
published in The Wall Street Journal two business days 
prior to your Statement/Closing Date for that billing 
period. Any increase or decrease in a variable annual percentage 
rate due to a change in the U.S. Prime Rate takes 
effect as of the first day of the billing period for which we 
calculate the variable annual percentage rate. If more than 
one U.S. Prime Rate is published, we may choose the 
highest rate. If The Wall Street Journal ceases publication 
or to publish the U.S. Prime Rate, we may use the U.S. 
Prime Rate published in any other newspaper of general 
circulation, or we may substitute a similar reference rate 
at our sole discretion. When a change in an applicable 
variable annual percentage rate takes effect we will apply 
it to any existing balances, subject to any promotional 
rate that may apply. 

An increase in the variable annual percentage rate means 
you will incur a higher finance charge, and perhaps a 
higher minimum payment. 

Promotional Rate Offers: 

At our discretion, we may offer you a promotional annual 
percentage rate for all or a part of any balances. The 
period of time for which the promotional rate applies 
may be limited. Any applicable promotional rate, the corresponding 
periodic rates, and the period of time during 
which it is in effect will appear on the card carrier. Any 
promotional rate offer will be subject to the terms of the 
offer and this Agreement. 
Finance Charges: 

Finance charges for purchases and cash advances (including 
any Extended Payment Feature balance) will begin to 
accrue from the date the transaction is added to the daily 
balance, as described below, and continue to accrue until 
payment in full is credited to your account. However, if you 
paid the total New Balance, if any, listed on the last billing 
statement by the payment due date on that statement you 
will have until the payment due date on your current statement 
to pay your total New Balance to avoid imposition of 
additional finance charges on purchases. 

We will calculate finance charges as follows: 

� We figure a portion of the finance charge on your 
account by multiplying the daily balance on each feature 
(e.g., standard purchases and standard advances) 
by the applicable daily periodic rate and separately 
adding together any such finance charges for each 
feature for each day in the billing period. 
� For finance charge calculation purposes, the billing 
period begins on the day after the Statement/Closing 
Date of the previous billing period and includes the 
Statement/Closing Date of the current billing period. 
The number of days in the billing period may vary. 
� To get the daily balance, we take the beginning balance 
for each feature every day (which may include unpaid 
finance charges from previous billing periods), add 
any new transactions, any new fees, and any finance 
charge on the previous day�s balance, subtract any 
credits or payments credited as of that day, and make 
other adjustments. A credit balance is treated as a 
balance of zero. 
� We add a new purchase to the appropriate purchase 
balance as of the Sale Date shown on your billing 
statement. 
� We add a new cash advance to the appropriate purchase 
or advance balance as of the Post Date shown 
on your billing statement. The �Post Date� is the date 
we receive your request for the cash advance. 
The Balances Subject to Finance Charge on the billing statement 
are the averages of the respective daily balances 
during the billing period. If you multiply this figure for each 
feature by the number of days in the billing period and 
by the applicable daily periodic rate, the result will be the 
periodic rate finance charges assessed for that feature, 
except for minor variations caused by rounding. This 

method of calculating the balance subject to finance charge 
and the periodic rate finance charges results in daily 
compounding of finance charges. 

Transaction Fee for Club Cash: 

You have obtained a cash advance for which we assess a 
cash advance transaction fee if you obtain funds from an 
automated teller machine (ATM), through home banking, or 
through a financial institution; make a wire transfer; acquire 
a money order, traveler�s check, lottery ticket, betting or 
casino chip, or similar item; or engage in another similar 
transaction. For each cash advance, we add an additional 
FINANCE CHARGE of 4.0% of the advance, but not less 
than $4.This fee will be added to the appropriate advance 
balance with the cash advance. (The amount of the cash 
advance may include a surcharge that the ATM owner 
imposes.) The cash advance transaction fee may cause the 
annual percentage rate on the billing statement on which 
the cash advance first appears to exceed the nominal annual 
percentage rate. 

Minimum Finance Charge: 

If finance charges based on periodic rates are being added 
to your account, but the total of such finance charges for 
purchases and cash advances is less than $.50, we assess 
a minimum FINANCE CHARGE, based on periodic rates, 
of $.50.We add the amount to the feature that is being 
assessed a finance charge. If more than one feature is 
assessed a finance charge, we may add the minimum 
finance charge to any such feature at our discretion. 

Credit Balance: 

You may not maintain a credit balance on your account in 
excess of your assigned revolving credit line. We will return 
to you any credit amount over $1.00 if the amount has been 
on your account longer than three months. You may request 
a refund of a credit balance at any time. We may reduce the 
amount of any credit balance by the amount of new charges 
billed to your account. 

Transaction Fee for Purchases Made 
in Foreign Currencies: 

For each purchase made in a foreign currency, we add to 
your account an additional FINANCE CHARGE of 3.0% 
of the amount of the purchase after its conversion into 

U.S. dollars. 
Information on Foreign Currency 
Conversion Procedures: 

If you make a purchase in a foreign currency or obtain a 
Club Cash� advance in a foreign currency, other than a 
Club Cash advance made at a branch or ATM of one of our 
Citi� affiliates, MasterCard� will convert the amount into 

U.S. dollars. MasterCard will act in accordance with their 
operating regulations or foreign currency conversion 
procedures then in effect. MasterCard currently uses a 
conversion rate in effect one day prior to its transaction 
processing date. Such rate is either a wholesale market 
rate or the government-mandated rate. 
If a cash advance is made in a foreign currency at a branch 
or ATM of one of our Citi affiliates, the amount will be converted 
into U.S. dollars by a Citi affiliate in accordance with 
its foreign currency conversion procedures then in effect. 
Our Citi affiliate currently uses a conversion rate in effect 
on its applicable processing date. Such rate is either a midpoint 
market rate or the government-mandated rate. The 
foreign currency conversion rate in effect on the applicable 
processing date for a transaction may differ from the rate in 
effect on the sale or posting date on your billing statement 
for that transaction. 

Minimum Payment: 

Each month you must make a Minimum Payment that is 
calculated as follows. First, we begin with any amount 
that is past due and add to it any amount in excess of 
your revolving credit line. Second, we add the minimum 
payment imposed on your Extended Payment Feature, 
if any. 

Third, we add the largest of the following: 

� The New Balance on the billing statement if it is less 
than $20; 
� $20 if the New Balance is at least $20; 
� 1% of the New Balance (which calculation is rounded 
down to the nearest dollar) plus the amount of your 
billed finance charges and any applicable late fee; 
or 
� 1.5% of the New Balance (which calculation is rounded 
down to the nearest dollar). 
However, the Minimum Payment will never exceed your 
New Balance. In calculating the Minimum Payment, we may 
subtract from the New Balance certain fees added to your 
account during the billing period. 

Payments: 

You must pay at least the minimum payment by the payment 
due date, and you may pay more at any time without a 
penalty. The New Balance shown on your billing statement 
may include amounts subject to different periodic rates. We 
will allocate your payments and credits to pay off balances 
at low periodic rates before paying off balances at higher 
periodic rates. The sooner you pay the New Balance, the less 
you will pay in finance charges. We may also allow you to 
skip a payment. If we do, we will notify you. If you choose 
to skip a payment when offered, we will continue to assess 
finance charges. 

Instructions for making payments are on your billing statement. 
In order to be credited as of a particular day, your 
payment must be received in the form specified, and by the 
hour specified, in those instructions. Do not send cash 
payments. We can accept late or partial payments, as well 
as payments that reflect �paid in full� or other restrictive 
endorsements, without losing any of our rights under this 
Agreement. You agree to pay us in U.S. dollars drawn on 
funds on deposit in the United States using a payment 
check, similar instrument, or automatic debit that will be 
processed and honored by your bank. We reserve the right 
to accept payments made in foreign currency and instruments 
drawn on funds on deposit outside the United States. 
If we do, we will select the effective currency conversion rate 
at our discretion and credit your account in U.S. dollars after 
deducting any fees or costs incurred in connection with processing 
your payment. If such fees or costs are not fully 
deducted at the time your account is credited for a payment, 
we will bill you separately for them. 

Optional Telephone Payment Service: 

You may request to make your payment by phone using our 
optional telephone payment service. Each time you make 
such a request, you agree to pay us the amount shown in 
the section entitled �Telephone Payment� on the back of 
the billing statement. Our representatives are trained to tell 
you this amount if you decide to use this optional telephone 
payment service. 

Late Fee: 

We will add a late fee to the standard purchase balance 
for each billing period you fail to pay, by its due date, the 
Minimum Payment. This late fee is based on your account 
balance as of the payment due date. The late fee is: $15 

on balances up to $100, $29 on balances of $100 up to 
$1,000, and $39 on balances of $1,000 and over. 

Returned Payment Fee: 

We will add a $29 fee to the standard purchase balance 
when a payment check or similar instrument is not 
honored, when we must return it because it cannot be 
processed, or when an automatic debit is returned unpaid. 
At our option, we will assess this fee the first time your 
check or payment is not honored, even if it is honored 
upon resubmission. 

Lost or Stolen Cards or Account Numbers: 

If any card or account number is lost or stolen, or if you 
think someone used or may use them without your permission, 
notify us at once by calling the Customer Service 
telephone number shown on the billing statement or the 
number obtained by calling toll-free or local Directory 
Assistance. We may require you to provide certain information 
in writing to help us find out what happened, and 
to comply with such procedures as we may require in 
connection with our investigation. Don�t use the card or 
account number after we�ve been notified, even if they are 
found or returned. You may be liable for unauthorized use 
of the account, but not for more than $50. You won�t be 
liable for unauthorized purchases or cash advances made 
after we�ve been notified of the loss or the theft; however, 
you must identify for us the charges on the billing statement 
that were not made by you, or someone authorized 
by you, and from which you received no benefit. 

Default: 

You default under this Agreement if you fail to pay, by 
its due date, the Minimum Payment listed on each billing 
statement; file for bankruptcy; pay by a check or similar 
instrument that is not honored or that we must return 
because it cannot be processed; pay by automatic debit 
that is returned unpaid; or default under any other Card 
Agreement that you have with us. If you default, we may 
close your account and demand immediate payment of 
the total balance. 

Preauthorized Charges: 

If you default, if the card is lost or stolen, or we change 
your account or account number for any reason, we may 
suspend automatic charges on that account to third party 
vendors for insurance premiums or other goods or services. 
If preauthorized charges are suspended, you must 

contact the third party vendor to reinstate them. You are 
responsible for making direct payment for such charges 
until you reinstate automatic charges. 

Collection Costs: 

If we refer collection of your account to a lawyer who 
is not our salaried employee, you will be liable for any 
reasonable attorney�s fees we incur, plus the costs and 
expenses of any legal action, to the extent permitted 
by law. 

ARBITRATION 
PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT 
CAREFULLY. IT PROVIDES THAT ANY DISPUTE MAY BE 
RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION 
REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING 
THE RIGHT TO A JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE 
IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. IN 
ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR 
INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY. ARBITRATION 
PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN 
COURT PROCEDURES. 

Agreement to Arbitrate: 

Either you or we may, without the other�s consent, elect 
mandatory, binding arbitration for any claim, dispute, or 
controversy between you and us (called �Claims�). 

Claims Covered: 

� What Claims are subject to arbitration? All Claims 
relating to your account, a prior related account, or our 
relationship are subject to arbitration, including Claims 
regarding the application, enforceability, or interpretation 
of this Agreement and this arbitration provision. All Claims 
are subject to arbitration, no matter what legal theory they 
are based on or what remedy (damages, or injunctive or 
declaratory relief) they seek. This includes Claims based 
on contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, 
your or our negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, 
or any other sources of law; Claims made as counterclaims, 
cross-claims, third-party claims, interpleaders or 
otherwise; and Claims made independently or with other 
claims. A party who initiates a proceeding in court may 
elect arbitration with respect to any Claim advanced in 
that proceeding by any other party. Claims and remedies 
sought as part of a class action, private attorney general 
or other representative action are subject to arbitration 
on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis, 

and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual 
(non-class, non-representative) basis. 

� Whose Claims are subject to arbitration? Not only ours 
and yours, but also Claims made by or against anyone 
connected with us or you or claiming through us or you, 
such as a co-applicant or authorized user of your account, 
an employee, agent, representative, affiliated company, 
predecessor or successor, heir, assignee, or trustee in 
bankruptcy. 
� What time frame applies to Claims subject to arbitration? 
Claims arising in the past, present, or future, including 
Claims arising before the opening of your account, are 
subject to arbitration. 
� Broadest interpretation. Any questions about whether 
Claims are subject to arbitration shall be resolved by interpreting 
this arbitration provision in the broadest way the 
law will allow it to be enforced. This arbitration provision is 
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (the �FAA�). 
� What about Claims filed in Small Claims Court? Claims 
filed in a small claims court are not subject to arbitration, so 
long as the matter remains in such court and advances only 
an individual (non-class, non-representative) Claim. 
How Arbitration Works: 

� How does a party initiate arbitration? The party filing an 
arbitration must choose one of the following two arbitration 
firms and follow its rules and procedures for initiating and 
pursuing an arbitration: American Arbitration Association or 
National Arbitration Forum. Any arbitration hearing that you 
attend will be held at a place chosen by the arbitration firm 
in the same city as the U.S. District Court closest to your 
then current billing address, or at some other place to which 
you and we agree in writing. You may obtain copies of the 
current rules of each of the arbitration firms and forms and 
instructions for initiating an arbitration by contacting them 
as follows: 
American Arbitration Association 
1633 Broadway, Floor 10 
New York, NY 10019 
website: www.adr.org 


National Arbitration Forum 

P.O. Box 50191 
Minneapolis, MN 55405 
website: www.arbitration-forum.com 
At any time you or we may ask an appropriate court to compel 
arbitration of Claims, or to stay the litigation of Claims 
pending arbitration, even if such Claims are part of a lawsuit, 
unless a trial has begun or a final judgment has been 
entered. Even if a party fails to exercise these rights at any 
particular time, or in connection with any particular Claims, 
that party can still require arbitration at a later time or in 
connection with any other Claims. 

� What procedures and law are applicable in arbitration? 
A single, neutral arbitrator will resolve Claims. The arbitrator 
will be either a lawyer with at least ten years experience or a 
retired or former judge, selected in accordance with the rules 
of the arbitration firm. The arbitration will follow procedures 
and rules of the arbitration firm in effect on the date the 
arbitration is filed unless those procedures and rules are 
inconsistent with this Agreement, in which case this 
Agreement will prevail. Those procedures and rules may 
limit the discovery available to you or us. The arbitrator 
will take reasonable steps to protect customer account 
information and other confidential information if requested 
to do so by you or us. The arbitrator will apply applicable 
substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable 
statutes of limitations, will honor claims of privilege recognized 
at law, and will have the power to award to a party 
any damages or other relief provided for under applicable 
law. You or we may choose to have a hearing and be represented 
by counsel. The arbitrator will make any award in 
writing and, if requested by you or us, will provide a brief 
statement of the reasons for the award. An award in arbitration 
shall determine the rights and obligations between 
the named parties only, and only in respect of the Claims 
in arbitration, and shall not have any bearing on the rights 
and obligations of any other person, or on the resolution of 
any other dispute. 
� Who pays? Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing 
fee. If we file, we pay; if you file, you pay, unless you get 
a fee waiver under the applicable rules of the arbitration firm. 
If you have paid the initial filing fee and you prevail, we will 
reimburse you for that fee. If there is a hearing, we will pay 
any fees of the arbitrator and arbitration firm for the first day 
of that hearing. All other fees will be allocated as provided by 
the rules of the arbitration firm and applicable law. However, 
we will advance or reimburse your fees if the arbitration firm 
or arbitrator determines there is good reason for requiring 
us to do so, or if you ask us and we determine there is good 
reason for doing so. Each party will bear the expense of 
that party�s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other 
expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party 
may recover any or all expenses from another party if the 
arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines. 

� Who can be a party? Claims must be brought in the name 
of an individual person or entity and must proceed on an 
individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitrator 
will not award relief for or against anyone who is not a 
party. If you or we require arbitration of a Claim, neither you, 
we, nor any other person may pursue the Claim in arbitration 
as a class action, private attorney general action or other 
representative action, nor may such Claim be pursued on 
your or our behalf in any litigation in any court. Claims, 
including assigned Claims, of two or more persons may not 
be joined or consolidated in the same arbitration. However, 
applicants, co-applicants, authorized users on a single 
account and/or related accounts, or corporate affiliates are 
here considered as one person. 
� When is an arbitration award final? The arbitrator�s award 
is final and binding on the parties unless a party appeals it in 
writing to the arbitration firm within fifteen days of notice of 
the award. The appeal must request a new arbitration before 
a panel of three neutral arbitrators designated by the same 
arbitration firm. The panel will consider all factual and legal 
issues anew, follow the same rules that apply to a proceeding 
using a single arbitrator, and make decisions based on 
the vote of the majority. Costs will be allocated in the same 
way they are allocated for arbitration before a single arbitrator. 
An award by a panel is final and binding on the parties 
after fifteen days has passed. A final and binding award is 
subject to judicial review and enforcement as provided by 
the FAA or other applicable law. 
Survival and Severability of Terms: 

This arbitration provision shall survive: (i) termination or 
changes in the Agreement, the account, or the relationship 
between you and us concerning the account; (ii) the bankruptcy 
of any party; and (iii) any transfer, sale or assignment 
of your account, or any amounts owed on your account, to 
any other person or entity. If any portion of this arbitration 
provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the entire arbitration 
provision shall not remain in force. No portion of this 
arbitration provision may be amended, severed, or waived 
absent a written agreement between you and us. 


Credit Reporting: 

We may report information about your account to credit 
bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other 
defaults on your account may be reflected on your credit 
report. If you request additional cards on your account for 
others, you understand that we may report account information 
in your name as well as in the names of those other 
people. We may also obtain follow-up credit reports on you 
(for example, when we review your account for a credit line 
increase). If you wish to know the names of the agencies 
we have contacted, write us at the Customer Service 
address listed on the billing statement. We will try to notify 
you by telephone or by mail of any legal process served 
on us in order to give you an opportunity to object to it, 
unless the law prohibits the notice. If you think we reported 
erroneous information to a credit reporting agency, write 
us at the Customer Service address listed on the billing 
statement. We will promptly investigate the matter and if 
our investigation shows you are right, we will contact 
each credit reporting agency to whom we reported and 
will request they correct the report. If we disagree with 
you after our investigation, we will tell you in writing or 
by telephone and instruct you how to submit a statement 
of your position to those agencies. Your statement will 
become a part of your credit record with them. 

Telephone Monitoring and Recording: 

From time to time we may monitor and record your telephone 
calls regarding your account with us to assure the 
quality of our service. 

Closing Your Account: 

You may close your account at any time by notifying us in 
writing. However, you remain responsible to pay the total 
balance according to the terms of this Agreement. We may 
close your account or suspend your account privileges 
at any time for any reason without prior notice. We may 
also reissue a different card, account number, or different 
checks at any time. You must return the card or the checks 
to us upon request. 

Refusal of the Card: 

We are not responsible if a transaction on your account is 
not approved, either by us or by a third party, even if you 
have sufficient credit available. We may limit the number of 
transactions that may be approved in one day. If we detect 
unusual or suspicious activity on your account, we may 

temporarily suspend your credit privileges until we can 
verify the activity. 

Changing this Agreement: 

We may change the rates, fees, and terms of this 
Agreement at any time for any reason. These reasons 
may be based on information in your credit report, such 
as your failure to make payments to another creditor 
when due, amounts owed to other creditors, the number 
of credit accounts outstanding, or the number of credit 
inquiries. These reasons may also include competitive 
or market-related factors. Changing terms includes 
adding, replacing, or deleting provisions relating to 
your account and to the nature, extent, and enforcement 
of the rights and obligations you or we may have relating 
to this Agreement. These changes are binding on 
you. However, if the change will cause a fee, rate, or 
minimum payment to increase, we will mail you written 
notice at least 15 days before the beginning of the 
billing period in which the change becomes effective. 
If you do not agree to the change, you must notify us 
in writing within 25 days after the effective date of the 
change and pay us the total balance, either at once or 
under the terms of the unchanged Agreement. Unless 
we notify you otherwise, use of the card after the effective 
date of the change shall be deemed acceptance of 
the new terms, even if the 25 days have not expired. 

Enforcing this Agreement: 

We can delay in enforcing or fail to enforce any of our 
rights under this Agreement without losing them. 

Assignment: 

We reserve the right to assign any or all of our rights and 
obligations under this Agreement to a third party. 

Applicable Law: 

The terms and enforcement of this Agreement shall be 
governed by federal law and the law",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

Paying Interest (grace period): The due date on an account is at least 21 days after the close of each billing cycle. No interest is charged on new purchases appearing on the consumer's current statement if the consumer paid in full the ""New Balance"" shown on the consumer's previous statement and the payment was received by that due date. We begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date.

Balance Computation Method: The method used to calculate the balances subject to interest on a consumer's account is called the ""average daily balance (including new purchases)."" Here are the details about this calculation method for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances: 

* How we calculate the balance on purchases (including balance transfers): (1) We start with the unpaid amount of purchases for the current billing cycle, which may include unpaid interest and fees from previous billing cycles. (2) Each day we subtract any payments or credits that apply to purchases. We add any new purchases, any new fees that apply to purchases, and any interest on the previous day's purchase balance if you have not paid in full the New Balance on your previous statement by the due date. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. (3) Then we add up all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle and divide by the total number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance of purchases"" for the current billing cycle. (Although balance transfers are calculated as part of the average daily balances (including new purchases), there is no grace period for balance transfers).

* How we calculate the balance on cash advances: (1) We start with the unpaid amount of cash advances, which may include unpaid interest and fees from previous billing cycles. (2) Each day we subtract any payments or credits that apply to cash advances. Then we add any new cash advances, any new fees that apply to cash advances, and any interest on the previous day's cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. (3) Then we add up all the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle and divide by the total number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance of cash advances.""

Variable Rate Information:   

How We Calculate Interest On Purchases (including balance transfers). We will calculate interest on purchases by multiplying the ""average daily balance of purchases"" by the total number of days in the billing cycle, and multiplying the product by the applicable daily periodic rate of interest then in effect. The daily periodic rate of interest for each billing cycle shall be computed by adding a margin (""Margin For Purchases"") to the value of the index and dividing by 365. The corresponding annual percentage rate will be the index plus the Margin For Purchases. (See the chart above for the margins, daily periodic rates and APRs that apply.) 

How We Calculate the Interest on Cash Advances. We will calculate interest on cash advances by multiplying the ""average daily balance of cash advances"" by the total number of days in the billing cycle, and multiplying the product by the daily periodic rate of interest then in effect. The daily periodic rate of interest for each billing cycle shall be a rate computed by adding a margin (""Margin For Cash Advances"") to the value of the index and dividing by 365. The corresponding annual percentage rate will be the index plus the Margin For Cash Advances. (See the chart above for the margins, daily periodic rates and APRs that apply.)

How We Calculate the Interest if the Penalty APR (Default Rate) is in Effect for Purchases (including balance transfers) and Cash Advances. If the Penalty APR is in effect for purchases (including balance transfers) and cash advances, the daily periodic rate of interest for each billing cycle shall be computed by adding a margin (""Margin for Penalty APR"") to the value of the index and dividing by 365. The corresponding annual percentage rate will be the index plus the Margin for Penalty APR. (See the chart above for the margins, daily periodic rates and APRs that apply.)

The Index We Use to Calculate Interest:  If you have a variable APR, your APR is based in part on the value of an index. Some credit card accounts are subject to a different index from others. The indexes we use are as follows:

INDEX A. The periodic rate of interest and corresponding annual percentage rate for purchases (including balance transfers), cash advances, and any Penalty APR in effect are based on the value of an index (""Index""). The Index in effect for each billing cycle shall be the ""Prime Rate"" of interest appearing in the ""Money Rates"" section of The Wall Street Journal published on the 20th day of the month preceding the first day of such billing cycle or, if The Wall Street Journal is not published on such date, the next day on which such Prime Rate is published. Any increase or decrease in the value of the Index will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the periodic rates of interest and annual percentage rates that apply to your Account. Any change to periodic rates of interest and corresponding annual percentage rates that are a result of a change to the Index will be effective as of the first day of the applicable billing cycle. An increase or decrease in the annual percentage rate will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of the interest, and in the minimum payment amount (unless the minimum payment is equal to or less than $10). 

INDEX B. The periodic rate of interest and corresponding annual percentage rate for purchases (including balance transfers) and cash advances are subject to change once each year, beginning with the billing cycle closing in September, based on the value of an index (""Index""). The Index in effect for each billing cycle shall be the ""Prime Rate"" of interest appearing in the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal published on the 20th day of May each year, rounded upward to the nearest .001%. An increase or decrease in the value of the Index will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the periodic rates of interest and annual percentage rates, the amount of the interest and in the minimum payment amount (unless the minimum payment is equal to or less than $10) applicable to your account.

This Agreement begins on the date that we make a final decision to open your Account.

3. CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT. You agree that, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, we may change at any time any of the terms of this Agreement including, but not limited to, annual percentage rates, fees, and whether the annual percentage rates are non-variable or variable. 

We will notify you of any Change if required by applicable law. In addition, if required by applicable law, the notice will tell you of any right you may have, and any steps you must take, to reject the Changes. Any required notice will be sent to you at your address shown on our records. 

If you properly notify us that you reject the Changes, your Account will be closed and you will be obligated to pay your outstanding balance under the terms of the Agreement in effect on the date you received the notice of Changes. If your Account is closed, if we ask, you agree to return all Cards and Checks. If you do not properly notify us that you reject the Changes by the date stated in the notice, you will be deemed to have accepted all Changes in the notice and to have accepted and confirmed all terms of your Agreement.

4. USE OF ACCOUNT. You must sign a Card in order to use it. A Card may be used for purchases of goods and services from a participating merchant for personal, family and household purposes only. You can get cash advances from us or from another participating financial institution by using an automated teller machine (ATM), by issuing a Check against your Account, or through any other means we offer. Cash advances also include the use of your Account to purchase Cash Equivalent Items. ""Cash Equivalent Items"" means traveler's checks; money orders; wire transfers; gift cards; lottery, betting and gambling purchases; and payments made to government entities. The Account may not be used for lottery, betting or gambling transactions if such transactions are made through the internet, or for any illegal transactions. We may refuse a request for a purchase, Balance Transfer or cash advance or return any Check unpaid if your right to use the Account has been revoked, if the transaction would cause you to exceed your applicable Credit Limit or Cash Advance Limit (defined in Section 5), or if you are in default on the Account (""default"" is explained in Section 22). We are not responsible for refusal by anyone to honor a Card or Check. Except as described in the ""Your Billing Rights"" section of this Agreement, we have no liability for any claim you may have arising out of any purchases made with a Card.

5. CREDIT LIMIT. Your ""Credit Limit"" is the maximum amount of credit we have established for your Account. Your separate ""Cash Advance Limit"" is part of the total Credit Limit. We will tell you the amount of your Credit Limit and Cash Advance Limit. They will be printed on the Card Mailer and on your Statement. You agree not to make purchases or obtain cash advances that would cause your Account to exceed the Credit Limit or Cash Advance Limit, as applicable. If you do, we can still charge you for all purchases and cash advances without giving up any of our rights under this Agreement. We may change your Credit Limit or Cash Advance Limit at any time and for any reason, including changes based on a review of the performance of your Account and/or periodic consumer credit reports we obtain from consumer reporting agencies.

6. AGREEMENT TO PAY. You agree to pay all amounts due on your Account. If your Account is a joint Account, each of you is jointly and individually responsible for all amounts due on the Account. If you let someone else use the Account, you are responsible for all charges made by that person, whether or not you have notified us that the person will be using your Account and whether or not the amount of the actual use exceeds your permission.

7. MINIMUM PAYMENT; APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. You must pay at least the �Minimum Payment� each month by the due date shown on your Statement. The Minimum Payment will be the largest of: (A) $10; or (B) 2.5% of the �New Balance� shown on your Statement, plus any past due amounts; or (C) 1.0% of the New Balance plus (i) the total interest (including any minimum interest charge) shown on your Statement, AND (ii) any fees listed in Section 11 of this Agreement shown on your Statement (except any annual fee or foreign transaction fee). If your New Balance is less than $10, you must pay us the total New Balance. In addition to the Minimum Payment, you agree to pay any �Overlimit Amount� shown on your Statement each month by the due date shown on your Statement. You may pay any or all of the New Balance of your Account at any time without incurring any prepayment charge. If you pay more than the Minimum Payment, you must pay at least the Minimum Payment each time we send you a Statement. With regard to each payment you make, we will decide in accordance with applicable law the application of your payment. Any payment you make in excess of the Minimum Payment will be allocated to balances with higher annual percentage rates before balances with lower annual percentage rates. Your Minimum Payment will be allocated to balances in our discretion. You cannot use a convenience check drawn on us to make a payment. All payments, including any payments made by check, must be in U.S. dollars and must be made in accordance with the payment terms and conditions provided in your Statement. We will credit your Account in accordance with those terms and conditions and the terms and conditions in this Agreement subject to applicable law. If you pay us by check, your check must be drawn on an account maintained at a financial institution located in the United States. We may allow you, from time to time, to skip one or more monthly payments, and we will notify you when this option is available. If you elect to skip a payment, interest will continue to accrue, and the requirement to make a Minimum Payment each month will resume following the skip payment period. IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT AVAILABILITY: In order to ensure there is enough time for a payment to clear the account on which it is drawn, we may not make the payment amount available to re-borrow for a period of 10 to 14 days, depending on the amount of the payment and other factors
 

8. STATEMENTS. We will send you a statement (""Statement"") at your address shown on our records at the end of each Billing Cycle as required by applicable law. We send only one Statement for all Cards with your Account number. If there are two or more of you, we send the Statement to the first applicant listed on any paper or electronic application or acceptance certificate you submitted or, if your application or acceptance of our offer to you was made verbally, the person we have designated as the ""primary"" accountholder. Each Statement covers a Billing Cycle. ""Billing Cycle"" means the days between the closing date shown on the last Statement we sent you and the closing date on your current Statement.

9. WHEN INTEREST WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR ACCOUNT.

A) PURCHASES. We will charge interest on purchases from the date of each transaction. Interest will continue to be imposed until the date payment in full of the New Balance is posted to your Account. You may avoid interest on new purchases appearing on your current Statement if you paid in full the New Balance shown on your previous Statement and your payment was received by that due date.

B) CASH ADVANCES. We will charge interest on each cash advance from the date of the cash advance. We will charge interest on each Check from the date it is received by us. We will figure interest on unpaid cash advances and Checks and on new cash advances and Checks even if you paid in full the New Balance shown on your previous Statement and your payment was received by that due date. In other words, there is no grace period for cash advances.

C) BALANCE TRANSFERS. We will charge interest on each Balance Transfer from the date the Balance Transfer posts to your Account. We will figure interest on unpaid Balance Transfers and on new Balance Transfers even if you paid in full the New Balance shown on your previous Statement and your payment was received by that due date. In other words, there is no grace period for Balance Transfers. Balance Transfers are included in the ""average daily balance of purchases"" and subject to the annual percentage rate and daily periodic rate of interest in effect for purchases unless otherwise specified. 

10. HOW WE CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST.

A) INDEX. Unless an introductory or special non-variable rate applies to your Account for a specified period of time as we may have disclosed to you, the periodic rate of interest and corresponding annual percentage rate for purchases (including Balance Transfers), cash advances, and any Penalty APR in effect, are based on the value of an index (""Index""). The Index in effect for each Billing Cycle shall be the ""Prime Rate"" of interest appearing in the ""Money Rates"" section of The Wall Street Journal published on the 20th day of the month preceding the first day of such Billing Cycle or, if The Wall Street Journal is not published on such date, the next day on which such Prime Rate is published. Any increase or decrease in the value of the Index will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the periodic rates of interest and annual percentage rates that apply to your Account. Any change to periodic rates of interest and corresponding annual percentage rates that is a result of a change to the Index will be effective as of the first day of the applicable Billing Cycle. An increase or decrease in the annual percentage rate will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of the interest and in the Minimum Payment amount (unless the Minimum Payment is equal to or less than $10). Your Statement will disclose the applicable annual percentage rates for the Billing Cycle. 

B) PURCHASES. We use the ""average daily balance (including new purchases)"" method to calculate interest on purchases. The following description is how we calculate interest on purchases:

(1) We start with the unpaid amount of purchases for the current Billing Cycle, which may include unpaid interest and fees from previous Billing Cycles.
(2) Each day we subtract any payments or credits that apply to purchases. Then we add any new purchases, any new fees that apply to purchases, and any interest on the previous day's purchase balance if you have not paid in full the New Balance on your previous Statement by that due date. This gives us the daily balance of purchases.
(3) Then we add up all the daily balances of purchases for the Billing Cycle and divide by the total number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance of purchases"" for the current Billing Cycle. 
(4) We will calculate interest on purchases by multiplying the ""average daily balance of purchases"" by the total number of days in the Billing Cycle, and multiplying the product by the applicable daily periodic rate of interest then in effect. The daily periodic rate of interest for purchases for each Billing Cycle shall be computed by adding a margin (""Margin For Purchases"") to the value of the Index and dividing by 365. The corresponding annual percentage rate will be the Index plus the Margin For Purchases. For details about your Margin For Purchases and the daily periodic rate of interest and corresponding annual percentage rate that apply to purchases, please refer to the ""Summary of Your Interest Rate Information"" section of the enclosed Interest Rate and Fee Disclosures. 

C) CASH ADVANCES. We use the ""average daily balance of cash advances"" to calculate interest on cash advances. The following description is how we calculate interest on cash advances:

(1) We start with the unpaid amount of cash advances, which may include unpaid interest and fees from previous Billing Cycles.
(2) Each day we subtract any payments or credits that apply to cash advances. Then we add any new cash advances, any new fees that apply to cash advances, and any interest on the previous day's cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances.
(3) Then we add up all the daily balances of cash advances for the Billing Cycle and divide by the total number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance of cash advances.""
(4) We will calculate interest on cash advances by multiplying the ""average daily balance of cash advances"" by the total number of days in the Billing Cycle, and multiplying the product by the daily periodic rate of interest then in effect. The daily periodic rate of interest for cash advances for each Billing Cycle shall be a rate computed by adding a margin (""Margin For Cash Advances"") to the value of the Index and dividing by 365. The corresponding annual percentage rate will be the Index plus the Margin For Cash Advances. For details about your Margin For Cash Advances and the daily periodic rate of interest and corresponding annual percentage rate that apply to cash advances, please refer to the ""Summary of Your Interest Rate Information"" section of the enclosed Interest Rate and Fee Disclosures.

D) PENALTY APR.
	
(1) Regardless of any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary (including any Special Rate Offers - See Section 10.F for details), you agree that we may, at our discretion, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to any notice we are required to give you under applicable law, increase the daily periodic rate and annual percentage rate for purchases, cash advances and Special Rate Transactions (defined in Section 10.F), including existing balances and all future transactions, to a higher ""Penalty APR"" if we have not received at least your Minimum Payment within 60 days after the due date for such Minimum Payment (""Penalty APR Event""). We will tell you, in accordance with applicable law, when the Penalty APR will take effect.
	
If the Penalty APR is in effect for purchases, cash advances and Special Rate Transactions, the daily periodic rate of interest for each Billing Cycle shall be computed by adding a margin (""Margin For Penalty APR Balances"") to the value of the Index and dividing by 365. The corresponding annual percentage rate will be the Index plus the Margin For Penalty APR Balances. For details about your Margin For Penalty APR Balances and the daily periodic rate of interest and corresponding annual percentage rate that apply when the Penalty APR is in effect, please refer to the ""Summary of Your Interest Rate Information"" section of the enclosed Interest Rate and Fee Disclosures. The application of the Penalty APR does not cure the Penalty APR Event that caused the Penalty APR to be charged, nor shall it affect any of our rights under the ""Default"" section of this Agreement (Section 22).

(2) After the Penalty APR goes into effect on your Account, your Account may again be eligible for the annual percentage rate that would otherwise apply after you meet the repayment requirements of your Agreement with us for six consecutive Billing Cycles. After six consecutive payments, your Account will be reviewed automatically. If all payments that you made were greater than or equal to the Minimum Payment required and were received by the dates, your annual percentage rate for all balances, as well as future transactions, will become terms which would then apply to your Account had the Penalty APR Event not occurred. Your Account will no longer be eligible for any special rate under a Special Rate Offer unless you are entitled to such special rate by applicable law. 

E) MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE. We will assess a minimum interest charge of $1.50 in any Billing Cycle in which interest is billed.

F) SPECIAL RATE OFFERS.

(1) We may offer special introductory or promotional rates and/or fees on your Account (""Special Rate Offers""). If we do, we will advise you of the annual percentage rates associated with the Special Rate Offer, how long they will be in effect, the balances to which they will apply, and other terms of the Special Rate Offer. Any Special Rate Offer will be subject to the terms of the offer and this Agreement. We may identify Special Rate Offer balances separately on your Statement. When a Special Rate Offer is in effect we may, at our discretion, discontinue the special rate pursuant to the ""Penalty APR"" section of this Agreement.

(2) If a Special Rate Offer applies to purchases, cash advances or Balance Transfers on your Account, we use the ""average daily balance of Special Rate Transactions"" to calculate interest on such transactions (""Special Rate Transactions""). The following description is how we calculate interest on each category of Special Rate Transactions:

(a) We start with the unpaid amount of the Special Rate Transactions, which may include unpaid interest and fees from previous Billing Cycles.

(b) Each day we subtract any payments or credits that apply to such Special Rate Transactions. Then we add any new Special Rate Transactions, any new fees that apply to such Special Rate Transactions and, if the Special Rate Transaction is a purchase and you have not paid in full the New Balance on your previous Statement by that due date or if the Special Rate Transaction is a Balance Transfer or cash advance, any interest on the previous day's Special Rate Transactions. This gives us the daily balance of such Special Rate transactions.

(c) Then we add up all the daily balances of such Special Rate Transactions for the Billing Cycle and divide by the total number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the ""average daily balance of Special Rate Transactions.""

(d) We will calculate interest on each category of Special Rate Transactions by multiplying the �average daily balance of Special Rate Transactions� by the total number of days in the Billing Cycle, and multiplying the product by the applicable daily periodic rate of interest then in effect for such category of Special Rate Transactions. The daily periodic rate of interest for Special Rate Offers for each Billing Cycle shall be computed by dividing the applicable annual percentage rate by 365. Please refer to the �Summary of Your Interest Rate Information� section of the enclosed Interest Rate and Fee Disclosures for detailed information about any introductory rate applicable to your Account. 

11. FEES. Subject to applicable law, we may charge your Account for the following fees. The amount of each of these fees is provided in the enclosed Interest Rate and Fee Disclosures. The application and payment of a fee will not correct the situation that caused the fee to be charged. Unless we tell you otherwise, all fees, except for cash advance fees, are included in the average daily balance of purchases for purposes of determining how much interest is due and owing on your Account (see Section 10.B for details). Your cash advance fees are included in your average daily balance of cash advances (see Section 10.C for details). 

A) Annual Fee. We may charge an annual fee to your Account if such fee is disclosed to you in the enclosed Interest Rate and Fee Disclosures.

B) Late Payment Fee. We may charge a late payment fee to your Account if you do not pay at least the Minimum Payment by the due date. We may charge an additional late fee for each Billing Cycle that your Account is past due.

C) Cash Advance Fee. In addition to any interest charged to your Account for cash advances you take, we may charge a fee to your Account each time you take a cash advance. 

D) Balance Transfer Fee. In addition to any interest charged to your Account for Balance Transfers you obtain, we may charge a fee to your Account each time you obtain a Balance Transfer. 

E) Returned Payment Fee. If you make a payment on your Account (1) with a check and that check is not honored by the financial institution on which it is drawn or (2) by an electronic debit entry to a bank account (autopay) and the entry is returned unpaid, we may charge you a returned payment fee. 

F) Returned Convenience Check Fee. If you write a Check on your Account and that Check is not honored because your Account is in default or overlimit, we may charge you a returned convenience check fee.

G) Stop Payment Fee. We may charge a stop payment fee if you order us to stop payment on a Check (see Section 16 for details) or Balance Transfer or if you renew a stop payment order. 

H) Research Fee. We may charge you a per copy research fee for all copies of Statements, Checks, or Balance Transfer checks or other documents in our files that you request. You will reimburse us for fees charged",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called �daily balance�. 

During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the daily rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 

To calculate the daily interest charge, we do the following steps each day for each balance type: 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. 

To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 

We apply fees among various balance types as follows: 

(a) late payment fees are treated as new purchases; 
(b) debt cancellation fees are added proportionately to each balance; 
(c) cash advance and stop payment fees are added to the cash advance balance; 
(d) balance transfer fees are added to the balance transfer balance; and 
(e) foreign transaction fees are added to the purchase balance. 

� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 

Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type.

do so. 

7. AUTHORIZED USER/JOINT ACCOUNT. If you ask us to send a credit card to another person that you want to let use your account, you will be responsible for all transactions made by that person. That person will be considered an authorized user. If another person is approved on the account, that person will be considered a joint accountholder. Each joint accountholder may use the account and agrees to the terms of this Agreement. No matter which joint accountholder 
uses the account, each of you must pay back the full amount owed on the account. We may treat each of you as one accountholder.

� Cash Advances � You may get cash advances as explained in section 9 below; and 

� Balance Transfers � From time to time, we may offer you the chance to transfer balances from your other credit card accounts to this account. Unless we 
tell you otherwise, we will treat balance transfers as purchases. We reserve the right to decline to process any balance transfer request for any reason, 
and will not transfer a balance from any of our affiliates. Transfers will be processed in the order determined by us. If the amount you wish to transfer is 
greater than your available credit limit, we may reject the request(s). It may take up to four weeks for a balance transfer request to be credited to your 
other credit card account(s). It is your responsibility to make any payments required to keep your other account(s) current and to close your other 
account(s), if you desire. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur on your other account(s) as a result of your balance transfer(s). If you have a dispute with a creditor, and pay the balance in question by transferring it to your account, you may lose certain dispute rights. 

You may use your account only for lawful personal, family or household purposes. You may not use your account for internet gambling or illegal purposes. You 
may not use your account to pay amounts you owe us on this account or on other accounts you have with us. These restrictions are for our benefit, and we are not responsible to you for enforcing them.

� Convenience Checks. We may send you convenience checks. We may not honor a convenience check (i) if you filed for bankruptcy, (ii) if the check is expired, (iii) if your account is closed, (iv) if the amount of the check would exceed your available credit or cash advance limit, or (v) as otherwise stated on 
your convenience check. 

� Cash and ATM Withdrawals. You can get cash from any institution that accepts the card or account. You can also get cash by making a withdrawal from an automated teller machine (ATM) that accepts the card or account. In addition to the fee we may charge, the ATM owner may charge you a fee for using the ATM.

Cash-like items include, for example, money orders, cashier�s checks, traveler�s checks, electronic or wire transfers, foreign currency or other in-bank transactions, tax 
payments, lottery tickets or other legalized gambling transactions, court costs, bail bonds and fines. 

10. CREDIT AND CASH ADVANCE LIMITS. 

A. Assigning Limits. We will assign the following limits on your account. We may increase or decrease either or both of these limits at any time. 

� Credit Limit � This is the highest amount of total credit we will extend to you on your account. 

� Cash Advance Limit � This is the highest amount of credit we will extend to you for cash advances made on your account. Cash transactions will also 
count towards your credit limit. 

B. Exceeding Limits. We may refuse to authorize you to use your account if that use (including any fees associated with that use) will cause the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit limit. You may not get a cash advance if that cash advance (including interest and cash advance fees) will cause the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit. If we approve a transaction that causes the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit limit or the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit, we do not give up any of our rights under this Agreement and we do not treat it as an increase in your credit limit or cash advance limit. 

C. Limiting Purchases, Balance Transfers or Cash Advances. We reserve the right to not approve transactions on your account. To prevent fraud, we may also limit the number or dollar amount of purchases, balance transfers or cash advances you can make in a particular amount of time. 

11. INTEREST. The section explains (i) the interest rates that will apply to your account, (ii) when interest will be charged on your account, and (iii) how the amount of interest is calculated. 

A. Rates. This following rates apply to purchases, balance transfers and cash advances. The Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account are 
shown in the table above and will also be shown on your billing statement. 

We calculate interest on the balance of your account each day. We use a daily rate to calculate the interest each day. The daily rate is equal to the APR 
divided by 365. 

1. Purchase Rate. 
For Premier Accounts: The daily rate for purchases is .05477% (APR 19.99%). 
For Choice Accounts: The daily rate for purchases is .06573% (APR 23.99%). 

2. Balance Transfer Rate. 
For Premier Accounts: The daily rate for balance transfers is .05477% (APR 19.99%). 
For Choice Accounts: The daily rate for balance transfers is .06573% (APR 23.99%). 

3. Cash Advance Rate. The daily rate for cash advances is .07395% (APR 26.99%). 

B. When We Charge Interest. We charge interest as described below. 

1. Purchases. We charge interest on your purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full except as set forth below: 

� We will not charge you interest during a billing cycle on any purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the billing cycle or (ii) you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in that billing cycle. 

� We will credit, as of the beginning of the billing cycle, any payment you make by the due date that we allocate to purchases if (i) you had no balance at 
the beginning of the previous billing cycle, or (ii) if you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in the previous billing cycle. 

2. Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. We charge interest on your balance transfers and cash advances (and their related fees) from the date you make the transaction until you pay them in full. You cannot avoid paying interest on balance transfers or cash advances or on their fees. 

C. How We Calculate Interest. During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on 
your account by applying the daily rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 

To calculate the daily interest charge, we do the following steps each day for each balance type: 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. 

To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 

We apply fees among various balance types as follows: 

(a) late payment fees are treated as new purchases; 
(b) debt cancellation fees are added proportionately to each balance; 
(c) cash advance and stop payment fees are added to the cash advance balance; 
(d) balance transfer fees are added to the balance transfer balance; and 
(e) foreign transaction fees are added to the purchase balance. 

� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 

� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 

Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. We charge a minimum of $2.00 of interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest and this charge is added proportionately to each balance type. 

12. FEES. We charge the following fees. The table at the beginning of this Agreement shows the amount of each fee. 

A. Transaction Fees. 

1. A Balance Transfer Fee for each balance transfer you make. 

2. A Cash Advance Fee for each cash advance you get. For ATM cash advances, this fee is in addition to any fee the ATM owner may charge you for using the ATM. 

3. A Foreign Transaction Fee for purchases or cash advances you make in currencies other than U.S. dollars and/or in a country other than the U.S., whether or not the transaction was in a foreign currency. 

B. Penalty Fees. A Late Payment Fee if we do not receive at least the total minimum payment due on your account as shown on your billing statement by 5:00 
p.m. (ET) on the due date. The amount of the late payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if you have paid at least your total minimum payment due by the due date in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if you have failed to pay at least the total minimum payment due by the due date in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the late payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for which the late payment fee is assessed, the amount of the late payment fee will instead be equal to the amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

C. Other Fees. A Stop Payment Fee of $20. We charge this fee if we stop payment on any convenience check at your request. 

13. PAYMENTS. 

A. Required Payment and Crediting of Payment. Each billing cycle you must pay at least the total minimum payment by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the payment due date. You may at any time pay more than the total minimum payment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payment may reduce the amount of interest you will pay. Any payments received after 5:00 p.m. (ET) will be credited as of the next day. We may delay making credit available on your account in the amount of your payment. 

B. Minimum Payment. Your total minimum payment is the sum of the following: 

1. Any past due amounts; and
 
2. The greater of either: 

(a) $25; or 

(b) the sum of (i) the interest, (ii) any late payment charged to your account in the current billing cycle and (iii) 1.0% of the new balance shown on your billing statement. We round up to the next highest whole dollar in figuring your total minimum payment. If your new balance on your billing statement is less than $25, then your total minimum payment will be equal to the new balance. 

C. How to Make a Payment. To make a payment you must follow all the instructions below and the instructions on your billing statement. If you do not, credit 
of your payment to your account may be delayed up to five days. 

1. Do the following: (a) make your payment in United States dollars by check, money order, or similar instrument from a bank located in the U.S.; (b) send 
the payment coupon from your billing statement with your payment; (c) send the payment and payment coupon in the envelope provided with your billing statement to the payment address listed on your billing statement; and (d) send only one payment and one payment coupon in each envelope. Alternatively you 
may make your payment online at the website address shown on your billing statement provided you make your payment in United States dollars from a bank located in the U.S. 

2. Do not do the following: (a) staple, paper clip, tape or fold your payment or payment coupon; (b) include any other papers or items with your payment; 
(c) use a balance transfer or convenience check from your account to pay us; or (d) send us cash. 

D. Disputed Amounts. If you send us correspondence about a disputed amount, you must send it to the address for billing inquiries shown on your billing statement. You may not send it to the payment address shown on your billing statement. By �disputed amount�, we mean a payment of less than the full balance on your account that is labeled as �payment in full� or similar language, or is given to us as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, or is given to us with other conditions or limitations. We may accept these types of payments without giving up any of our rights. 

E. Authorization. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer 
from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be 
withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. 

F. Payment Allocation. We reserve the right to select the method by which the required minimum payment is allocated to different balances on your account. 
Some or all of the required minimum payment on your account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. The payment allocation method that we use may result in higher interest on your account or reduced savings attributable to any special promotions. Any payment you make in excess of the 
required minimum payment will be allocated to balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs, unless applicable law requires or permits otherwise (such as when your account has a certain type of special promotion). 

14. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS. At times, we may offer you special promotions when you use your account for certain transactions. These special promotions will have some terms that are different from the terms in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement apply to any special promotion, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the special promotion. We may terminate your participation in any special promotion if you become more than 60 days late on any payment due on your account. If this happens, each special promotion balance will no longer be subject to the terms of the special promotion and will instead be subject to the terms of this Agreement. Please see any special promotion advertising (including in-store signs) or other disclosures provided to you for the full terms of any special promotion offered. 

15. CURRENCY CONVERSION. If you make a transaction with your account in a currency other than U.S. dollars, MasterCard will convert the transaction amount 
into U.S. dollars using its currency conversion procedure. Under the currency conversion procedure that MasterCard currently uses, the non-U.S. dollar transaction amount is converted into a U.S. dollar amount by multiplying the transaction amount in the non-U.S. dollar currency by a currency conversion rate. The currency conversion rate that MasterCard typically uses is either a government mandated rate, or a wholesale rate provided to MasterCard. The currency conversion rate that MasterCard uses for a particular transaction is the rate MasterCard uses for the applicable currency when the transaction is processed. This rate may differ from the rate in effect when the transaction occurred or when it was posted to your Account, and may be higher than the rate you could have gotten if you had converted U.S. dollars into the foreign currency. 

16. UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should call us immediately at: 
1-866-848-5625. 

You will not be liable for any unauthorized use on your account. 

You agree that unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given your card or allowed use of your account. You will be responsible 
for all use by such a person. 

17. YOUR CREDIT REPORTS AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION. 

A. Using and Sharing Your Information. When you applied for an account you gave us information about yourself. You also agreed that we could ask others for information about your creditworthiness and that we could ask consumer reporting agencies for your consumer report. We use this information in considering your application. We also use this information for any updates, renewals or extensions of credit on your account.

18. USE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOUR ACCOUNT. We will use information about you and your account as set forth in the privacy policy that is attached to or enclosed with this document. 

19. CHANGE OF ADDRESS/PHONE NUMBER. You agree to tell us right away if you change your address or phone number(s). We will contact you at the address in our records until we are able to update our records with your new address.

You also consent to us and any other owner or servicer of your account contacting you about your account, including using text messages, any automatic telephone dialing system and/or an artificial or prerecorded voice when contacting you, even if you are charged for the call under your phone plan. You are responsible for any charges for contacting you that may be billed to you by your communications carriers. 

21. TELEPHONE MONITORING. For quality control purposes, you permit us to listen to or record telephone calls between you and us. 

22. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. 

A. When You May Close Your Account. You may close your account at any time by writing or calling us and asking us to close your account. You must send this writing to the address shown on your billing statement or call us at the customer service number shown on your billing statement. We will close your 
account after we get your request. 

B. When We May Close Your Account. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may close your account at any time and for any reason. 

C. After You or We Close Your Account. If you or we close your account, you must stop using it. You will still have to pay us the full amount you owe on 
your account. This Agreement controls your account until you pay it in full. 

23. DEFAULT. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, you are in default if you: 

� Make a late payment; 
� Do not follow any other term of this Agreement; or 
� Become bankrupt or insolvent. 

If you default or upon your death, we may, subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law: (i) make the full amount owing on your account due 
right away; (ii) bring a legal action to collect all amounts owed; and/or (iii) take any action allowed by law. We may also reduce your Credit Limit or close 
your account at any time whether or not you are in default. 

24. COLLECTION COSTS. If we ask an attorney to collect your account, we may charge you our collection costs. Collection costs may include court costs and reasonable attorneys� fees. We will charge these costs only if the attorney we ask to collect is not our salaried employee and the law allows us to do so. 

25. DISPUTE AND CLAIM RESOLUTION (INCLUDING ARBITRATION) PROVISION. 

General/Requirement to Arbitrate. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED. This Provision replaces any existing arbitration provision with us and will stay in force no matter what happens to your Account, including termination. 

Upon demand, and except as otherwise provided below, you and we must arbitrate individually any dispute or claim between you, any joint cardholder and/or 
any additional cardholder, on the one hand; and us, our affiliates, and agents on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises from or relates to your Account. However, we will not require you to arbitrate: (1) any individual case in small claims court or your state�s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court; or (2) any claim by us that only involves our effort to collect money you owe us. However, if you respond to a collection lawsuit by claiming that we engaged in any wrongdoing, we may require you to arbitrate. 

YOU AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. ALSO, YOU MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ON BEHALF OF ANY CARDHOLDER WHO IS NOT A JOINT OR ADDITIONAL CARDHOLDER WITH YOU ON YOUR ACCOUNT (AN �UNRELATED CARDHOLDER�), AND YOU AGREE THAT NO UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY BRING ANY CLAIMS AGAINST US ON YOUR BEHALF. CLAIMS BY YOU AND BY AN UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY NOT BE JOINED IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. Only a court may decide whether any part of this paragraph is enforceable. If it is finally determined that this paragraph is not fully enforceable, only this sentence of the Provision will remain in force and the remainder of the Provision will be null and void, provided that the court�s determination concerning the enforceability of this paragraph shall be subject to appeal. 

Starting an Arbitration. If you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, the electing party must notify the other party in writing. This notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit and can be given in papers filed in the lawsuit. Otherwise, your notice must be sent to GE Money Bank, Legal Operation, P.O. 
Box 29110, Shawnee Mission, KS 66201, ATTN: ARBITRATION DEMAND and our notice must be sent to the most recent address for you in our files. The party seeking 
arbitration must select as the arbitration administrator either the American Arbitration Association (�AAA�), 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, 
www.adr.org, (800) 778-7879, or JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018, www.jamsadr.com, (800) 352-5267. If neither the AAA nor JAMS is 
able or willing to handle the dispute, then the parties will resolve their dispute in court. 

The arbitration administrator will appoint the arbitrator and tell the parties what to do next. The arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least ten years legal 
experience. In making decisions or awarding remedies, the arbitrator must apply the same law and legal principles that would apply in court, but may use 
different procedural rules. If the administrator�s rules conflict with this Provision, this Provision will control. 

Arbitration Location and Fees. The arbitration will take place by phone or at a location reasonably convenient to you. Upon your request, we will normally 
pay all the fees the administrator or arbitrator charges, if we believe you are acting in good faith. We will always pay these arbitration costs, as well as your legal fees and costs, to the extent required under applicable law or in order for this Provision to be enforced. 

Governing Law. This Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (the �FAA�). Utah law shall apply to the extent state law is relevant under Section 
2 of the FAA in determining the validity of this Provision. The arbitrator must follow: (1) the substantive law, consistent with the FAA, that would apply 
if the matter had been brought in court, (2) this Provision, and (3) the administrator�s rules. The arbitrator�s decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator�s award. 

Rejecting this Provision. You may reject this Provision, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any dispute or claim. Rejection will not affect any other aspect of the cardholder agreement. To reject, you must send us a notice within 60 days after you open your account or we first provide you with 
a right to reject this Provision. The notice must include your name, address, and account number and be mailed to GE Money Bank, P.O. Box 981429, El Paso, 
TX 79998-1429. This is the only way you can reject this Provision. 


26. WAIVER. We may decide to give up any of our rights under this Agreement. This includes our right to impose the full amount of any charge. If we do, we do 
not give up any of our other rights under this Agreement. If we give up any of our rights in one situation, we do not give up the same right in another situation. Except as we may agree in a signed writing, we do not give up any rights if we (a) accept a late or partial payment, (b) accept a check or other payment marked �payment in full� or tendered with other conditions o",Error summarizing: index out of range in self

(i) ACCOUNT 

This is the Agreement that covers your Banco Popular North America MasterCard credit card account 
(called your �Account�) with us. In this Agreement, and in your Account Statements (each, an 
�Account Statement�), the words �you� and �your� refer to all persons named on the credit card 
application, credit card, or acceptance form, as well as their heirs and executors, and the words �we�, 
�us� and �our� and �Bank� refer to Banco Popular North America. 


 

You can use your credit card (�Card�) to purchase goods and services at participating merchants and 
to take Cash Advances as described in this Agreement. You agree not to use your Card for any 
unlawful purpose. If you use, or allow someone else to use, any Card associated with your Account 
for any other purpose, you will be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us and 
MasterCard� International Incorporated (�MasterCard�) for all amounts or expenses either Banco 
Popular North America or MasterCard pays as a result of such use. 

 

(ii) PROMISE TO PAY 

You promise to pay for (a) credit extended by Banco Popular North America, to you or to anyone 
whom you permit to use any Card associated with your Account; (b) INTEREST CHARGES, late 
charges, and any other fees or administrative charges (e.g., returned check charges) provided in this 
Agreement; and (c) collection costs and attorneys' fees as permitted by applicable law if your Account 
should go into default. 

 

(iii) CASH ADVANCES 

The term �Cash Advance� includes the following transactions: (1) Automated Teller Machine (ATM) 
transactions; (2) convenience check transactions; (3) money orders, cashiers checks, travelers 
checks, wire transfers, foreign currency or other in-bank transactions; (4) tax payments; (5) certain 
permitted gambling transactions; and (6) court costs, bail bonds and fines. Convenience checks are 
used the same as personal checks and are drawn from your Account and billed on your monthly 
Account Statement. 

 

(iv) CREDIT LIMIT 

You agree that the Bank, for your convenience, will establish a credit limit and that the purchases 
and Cash Advances that you charge to this Account, shall at no time exceed your credit limit. Upon 
receipt of your Card, you will be informed of your credit limit, which will appear in each Account 
Statement as defined herein. You agree that the Bank may, from time to time, change your credit 
limit, taking into consideration your previous credit experience or payment history. Should you 
exceed your authorized credit limit, the Bank will have the right to cancel the Card, require its return 
or forfeit the Card and close the Account. Any amount due, in excess of your authorized credit limit, 
shall be payable immediately. Your minimum payment shall include any excess over your authorized 
credit limit. 

 

(v) INTEREST CHARGES 

Monthly INTEREST CHARGES will be computed on all balances on this Account. The INTEREST 
CHARGE applied to purchases and balance transfers from other institutions will be based on variable 
Annual Percentage Rates (�APR�). This APR can increase or decrease for each billing period. Different 
APRs can apply to purchases, Cash Advances, balance transfers from other institutions, and 
convenience checks. Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for specific APRs related to your 
Account. 

Variable APRs will be determined by adding the United States Prime Rate as published in The Wall 
Street Journal (�Prime Rate�) to a margin. There is no pre-set limit on rate increases. The amount of 
your margins and current APRs are disclosed in the accompanying card mailer. We determine the 
margins applicable to your Account based on your credit history at the time of approval of your Card 
application. An increase in the Prime Rate will cause an increase in your APR, the INTEREST CHARGE 
and your minimum payment. 

The �Daily Periodic Rate� is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances and is determined 
by dividing the APR by 365 and rounding up. For each billing period, the APR will be based on the 
Prime Rate published two business days prior to the Account Statement/closing date for that billing 
period. In the event the Prime Rate is not available as of that date, we may substitute a similar 
published rate that is outside of our control. To the extent permitted by law, any change in your APR 
will apply to the existing balance on your Account and to new transactions. 

The INTEREST CHARGE is calculated separately for purchases and Cash Advances. The INTEREST 
CHARGE is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and by the 
number of days in the billing period. 

The Average Daily Balance for purchases is obtained by taking into account the initial daily balance on 
purchases, plus any new purchases, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on purchases, and any 
other fees and charges that we add that day, minus any payments and credits we apply to the 
purchase balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing period are added and the 
total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. New purchases are added to the daily 
balance on posting date, unless we elect to use a later date. Purchases will begin to accrue INTEREST 
CHARGE on the date of posting. No INTEREST CHARGE will be imposed on a purchase added to your 
daily balance during the billing cycle covered by the Account Statement if that Account Statement 
shows no previous balance or shows that the previous balance was paid in full by its payment due 
date. Also, no additional INTEREST CHARGE will be charged on any purchases included in the new 
balance of a monthly Account Statement if you pay the new balance in full on or before the date 
specified in your Account Statement. The payment due date will be 25 days or more, depending upon 
the payment due date on your Account. 

The Average Daily Balance for Cash Advances is obtained by taking into account the initial daily 
balance on Cash Advances, plus any new Cash Advances, and any unpaid INTEREST CHARGES on 
Cash Advances, and any other Cash Advance fees that we add that day, minus any payments and 
credits we apply to the Cash Advance balance that day. Then all the daily balances within the billing 
period are added and the total is divided by the number of days in the billing period. The INTEREST 


CHARGE on Cash Advances, balance transfers and convenience checks will be imposed from the date 
the transaction is conducted. There is no �free ride� period for such transactions. 

Please refer to the accompanying card mailer for other terms which are made a part of this 
Agreement. 

 

(vi) ANNUAL FEE 

If applicable, the annual fee will be reflected on your first Account Statement after the first Card is 
issued and subsequently on each anniversary of the issuance of the first Card. Please refer to the 
accompanying card mailer for specific annual fee information related to your Account. 

 

(vii) MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT 

We will not impose any late charges or penalty fees if you pay at least the minimum payment 
reflected on your Account Statement by the specified �Payment Due� date. If you wish, you may pay 
more than the minimum payment and at any time you may pay the entire amount due for the current 
billing cycle. Send payments to Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 
2938, Milwaukee, WI 53201-2938. 

 

Your payment will be credited as of the day we receive it, subject to any applicable cutoff hour. The 
new cutoff time for payments received by mail, telephone and other electronic means is 5:00 p.m. 
Central Time. We offer the convenience of online payments. Please visit www.mypopularcards.com to 
set up an account and avail of this free online payment service. Payments received by 5:00 pm CST, 
Monday through Friday, will be processed the same day. Online payments received on Saturday, 
Sunday or a Bank holiday will be processed the next business day. If the payment is made at a Bank 
branch during business hours in cash or with a check drawn against the Bank, it will be processed the 
same day. Credit for any other payments may be delayed five (5) business days during which interest 
will not accrue. If your payment due date falls on a weekend or legal federal holiday, the payment 
received will be credited to the account on the next business day and will not be considered late. If your 
payment is received after the payment cutoff time on the due date or any time thereafter, a late 
payment fee will be charged to your Account. Please refer to the back of your card mailer for more 
details regarding the minimum monthly payment and other important terms applicable to your Account. 

 

(viii) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS 

If you pay the required minimum payment of the monthly Account Statement, the payment shall be 
applied in the following way: first to INTEREST CHARGES and the rest shall be applied first to the 
debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances, with the lowest APR and then to the debt with the 
higher APR in ascending order. Consequently, the debt with the higher APR will not be reduced, until 
the debt with the lower APR is paid in full. If you pay an amount in excess of the minimum required 
payment, the excess shall be applied first to the debt resulting from purchases and Cash Advances 
with the highest APR and then to the debt with the lowest APR in descending order. 

 

All payments by mail must be made by check or money order. Payments may not be made by 
attempting to effect a transfer or by using a convenience check from this Account or from any other 
Banco Popular North America credit card account. You agree that any payment you make may be, 
but is not required to be, returned to you without applying it to your Account and without 
presentment or protest, for reasons including, but not limited to, that the check or money order: (1) 
is missing a signature; (2) is drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (3) contains a 
restrictive endorsement; (4) is post dated; (5) is not payable to Banco Popular North America; (6) is 
not payable in U.S. dollars; (7) is not paid upon presentment; or (8) results from an attempted 
transfer or is drawn on a convenience check. You agree to pay any Bank collection fees we incur for 
any check payments made in U.S. dollars drawn on a financial institution not located in the United 
States. All payments made by mail under this Agreement must be received at the address specified 
on your Account Statement. 

 

Any conditional check, money order or any other instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a 
disputed debt or as an accord and satisfaction or containing a restrictive endorsement must be sent 
to us at the Banco Popular North America, Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 2938, Milwaukee, 
WI 53201-2938. You must note conspicuously on the face of the payment that it is tendered for this 
purpose. If you make a payment in any other manner and we accept it, we will not have waived our 
rights to collect any amounts owed under this Agreement. Even though your payment may be posted 
to your Account, we may not restore your available credit or Cash Advance available credit 
immediately. 

 

(ix) MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENT 

The Bank shall mail to you a monthly Account Statement at the end of each billing period in which 
you have a balance in excess of $1. You must notify the Bank, in writing, of any error in the Account 
Statement, within sixty (60) days, following the date on which the Account Statement was mailed. 

 

(x) FEES 

Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

a. Penalty fee: A late fee will be added to the standard purchase balance for each billing period you 
fail to pay by its due date the minimum payment due. Returned payment fees may also be charged. 

 

b. Currency conversion fee: If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, other than a cash 
advance made at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, MasterCard will convert the charge into a U.S. 
dollar amount. MasterCard currently uses a conversion rate in effect one day prior to its transaction 
processing date. Such rate is either a wholesale market rate or the government-mandated rate. 
Please refer to your card mailer backer for more details on the applicable charges to your Account. 

 


If you make a Cash Advance in a foreign currency at a branch or ATM of one our affiliates, the 
amount is converted into U.S. dollars by our affiliate in accordance with its foreign currency 
conversion procedures then in effect. Our affiliate currently uses a conversion rate in effect on its 
applicable processing date. Such rate is either a mid-point market rate or the government-mandated 
rate. 

 

The foreign currency conversion rate in effect on the applicable processing date for a transaction may 
differ from the rate in effect on the sale or post date on your Account Statement for that transaction. 

 

If a transaction is converted by a third party prior to such transaction being processed by MasterCard, 
the foreign currency conversion rate for that transaction will be the rate selected by that third party. 

 

c. Administrative charges: We may charge you a fee to take advantage of certain optional 
administrative services we provide our Cardmembers such as copy of Account Statements, additional 
credit cards or express delivery services. Each time an administrative service is offered to you, any

each time you opt to take advantage of an administrative service. These services are optional and are 
not required to be used by you.

subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. Upon default, we have the right to terminate or 
suspend your credit privileges under this Agreement, to change the terms of your Account and this 
Agreement, may require you to pay your entire Account balance including all accrued but unpaid

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS: Keep this Document for Future Use 

 

This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing 
Act. 

 

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Account Statement 

If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, write to us at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

In your letter, give us the following information: 

� Account information: Your name and account number. 
� Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
� Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your Account Statement, describe what 
you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. 


 

You must contact us: 

� Within 60 days after the error appeared on your Account Statement. 
� At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment 
on the amount you think is wrong. 


 

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not 
required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 

 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter 

When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 

1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also 
tell you if we have already corrected the error. 

2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we 
believe the Account Statement is correct. 

 

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 

� We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
� The charge in question may remain on your Account Statement, and we may continue to impose 
INTEREST CHARGES on that amount. 
� While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your 
balance. 
� We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 


 

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 

� If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any INTEREST CHARGES 
or other fees related to that amount. 



� If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with 
applicable INTEREST CHARGES and fees. We will send you an Account Statement of the amount 
you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the 
amount we think you owe. 


 

If you receive our explanation but still believe your Account Statement is wrong, you must write to us 
within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent 
without also reporting that you are questioning your Account Statement. We must tell you the name 
of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when 
the matter has been settled between us. 

 

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you 
question even if your Account Statement is correct. 

 

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Card Purchases 

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your Card and you 
have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay 
the remaining amount due on the purchase. 

 

To use this right, all of the following must be true: 

1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing 
address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. 

(Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to 
you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 

2. You must have used your Card for the purchase. Purchases made with Cash Advances from an ATM 
or with a check that accesses your Account do not qualify. 

3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 

 

If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in 
writing at: 

Banco Popular North America 

Cardmember Service Center, P.O. Box 1111, Madison, WI 53701-1111 

 

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we 
finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount 
and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

Terms and Conditions
How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called ""average daily balance (including new purchases)"".
Billing Rights: Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided in this Cardholder Agreement.

You may pay the entire New Balance on your Account at any time.
NOTICE FOR MARRIED WISCONSIN RESIDENTS: No provision of a marital property agreement, unilateral statement under Section 766.59 of the Wisconsin Statutes, or court order under Section 766.70 of the Wisconsin Statutes adversely affects the interest of the creditor unless the creditor, prior to the time the credit is granted, is furnished a copy of the agreement, statement or decree or has actual knowledge of the adverse provision when the obligation to the creditor is incurred. If you are married, by submitting your credit card application you are confirming that this credit card obligation is being incurred in the interest of your marriage and your family. If the credit card for which you are applying is granted, you will notify the Bank if you have a spouse who needs to receive notification that credit has been extended to you.

CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
1. GENERAL: Each person signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application for a credit card account (“Account”) as applicant or joint applicant applies for an Account with HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., a national banking association, and requests one or more credit card(s) bearing the name or tradename of Saks Fifth Avenue to be used in connection with the Account. The word “Card” means any credit card(s) issued to you or an authorized user of your Account. In this Agreement, the words “you” and “your” refer to the applicant and joint applicant named on the credit card application and the words “we”, “us” and “our” refer to HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., located at 1111 Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144.
If your application is approved, “applicant” will be referred to as “primary cardholder” for purposes of this agreement.
If we accept your application to open an Account, you agree that you will only purchase goods and services for personal, family and household purposes from merchants which honor the Card.
2. ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT: By a) signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application, using or permitting others to use the Card, b) signing or permitting others to sign sales slips; or c) making or permitting others to make purchases by telephone, Internet, or any other means, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Cardholder Agreement and Disclosure Statement, which includes an arbitration provision.
3. PROMISE TO PAY: You agree to pay all amounts charged to the Account, whether incurred by you or anyone you authorize or permit to use your Account or Card. If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.
4. ABILITY TO REPAY: When you use the Account or permit others to use the Account, you represent that you have the ability and intention to repay all amounts charged to the Account.
5. BILLING STATEMENT: We will send you a billing statement monthly for each billing cycle at the end of which you have a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00, or in which a Interest Charge has been imposed. The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other charges or fees, including credit insurance (if applicable), and all payments and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle. The billing statement will show the amount owed on your Account. The total Amount owed is called “New Balance” on your billing statement subject to the terms of Promotional Credit Plan purchases, if any, as indicated below.
6. PROMOTIONAL CREDIT PLANS: The following Promotional Credit Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase:   a) Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan – no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase for a specified period, as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; b) Same As Cash/Monthly Payment Credit Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase before the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, Interest Charges will be imposed from the purchase date; c) Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; d) Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan – A special repayment factor will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; e) Special Repayment Factor/Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A special repayment factor and a reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle. All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Credit Plan are referred to as Regular Credit Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Card. Call 1-888-367-4310 or review the Application of Payments section of this Agreement for information.
7. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(iv) a purchase on a Same As Cash Credit Plan if the full cash sales price is paid in full before the promotion expiration date.
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan other than a Same As Cash Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Same As Cash Credit Plan during a cycle, the amount will be the sum of the following daily Interest Charge calculations for the Credit Plan during the current cycle and during each of the prior billing cycles (each a “Prior Cycle”) from the transaction date of the purchase through the current cycle: (i) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for the Current Cycle times the Daily Balance for each day in the current cycle; and (ii) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for each Prior Cycle times the Daily Balances of the Credit Plan for each day during each Prior Cycle.
(e) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any credit insurance premiums (if applicable) incurred on that day and 4) any late fees, over the credit limit fees, returned payment fees or other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. For any Same As Cash Credit Plan, credit insurance premiums (if applicable) are not included in the Daily Balance of that Credit Plan during the promotional period. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(f) The Daily Periodic Rate which is used to determine your Interest Charges and the corresponding Annual Percentage Rate, will be variable rates which may change monthly. The Daily Periodic Rate will be one-three hundred sixty fifth of the sum of the U.S. prime rate published in the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal that is in effect on the last day of the month (“Prime Rate”) plus a “Spread” of 20.74 percentage points for the Standard Rate and a “Spread” of 23.74 percentage points for the Penalty Rate. Any changes in the Prime Rate will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle beginning in the next month.
For example, as of the billing cycle beginning September 1, 2011, the Interest Charge for the Standard Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .06573% (corresponding 23.99% Annual Percentage Rate) and the Interest Charge for the Penalty Rate would have been a Daily Periodic Rate of .07395% (corresponding 26.99% Annual Percentage Rate). An increase in the Prime Rate will increase your applicable Daily Periodic Rate which may increase the Interest Charge and the Minimum Payment due on your Account. Your APR may increase to the Penalty APR if we fail to receive your minimum payment with in 60 days when due. You will no longer be eligible for the Standard Rate and all existing Promotional Credit Plans will terminate, and your entire Account balance will be subject to the Penalty Rate. If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the new Penalty APR goes into effect.  If you make the next six consecutive on time minimum payments starting with your first payment due once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APR(s) applicable to your Account.  If you do not make these six consecutive on time minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.
8. MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE: A minimum Interest Charge of $1.00 will be assessed for each billing cycle in which an Interest Charge is payable.
9. FEES: We may impose on your Account the following fees, which will be added to your Account when assessed:
a)	Late Payment Fee: A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
	The amount of the Late Payment Fee is shown in the chart below.  In no event will your Late Payment Fee exceed the amount of your Minimum Payment Due.

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - Up to and including $100
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $19
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $19

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $100 and up to and including $300
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $29

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $300
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $35
b)	Returned Payment Fee: A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
	Your Returned Payment Fee is $25.
	In no event will your Returned Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
c)	Research Fees: A Research Fee may be assessed to the Account for each copy of a requested document. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such copies are requested.
d)	Reissued Card Fee: You may be charged $5 each time you request that your credit card be reissued.
e)	Payment by Phone Fee: A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment is requested.
f)	Over the Credit Limit Fee: In the event you exceed your credit limit, you will be charged an Over the Credit Limit Fee of $0.
g)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
10. DEBT CANCELLATION: If available and you elect debt cancellation, you authorize us to charge the fee for such debt cancellation to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the debt cancellation fee is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the fee is being assessed. Debt cancellation charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
11. MINIMUM PAYMENT: “Minimum Payment Balance” is your “New Balance” less balances on Special Repayment Factor Credit Plans. You agree to pay us at least the Minimum Payment due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due.
To obtain your Minimum Payment Due, we add the following amounts (1+2+3):
1) Any delinquent amount you owe us from a previous cycle;
2) the greater of
a.) 4% of your Minimum Payment Balance
or
b.) 1% of your Minimum Payment Balance plus current billed Interest Charges
and current Late Fees plus the Special Repayment Factors for any Promotional Credit Plans with Special Repayment Factors, rounded to the next highest dollar.
If this amount is less than $25, we will use $25.
3) any debt cancellation fees attributable to Promotional Credit Plans with Reduced Rate/Special Repayment Factors.
Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments which may affect crediting of your payments.
12. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) not drawn in U.S. dollars on funds on deposit in the U.S.; (b) missing a signature; (c) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (d) restrictively endorsed; (e) postdated; (f) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (g) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to PO Box 10298, Jackson, MS 39289-0298. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
13. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances.  If you have a Same As Cash Credit Plan(s), we will automatically apply payments received during the final two complete billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first to the required Minimum Payment Due and next to the plan(s) that is expiring, in the order of expiration; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0% APR for purposes of determining payment application.
14. CREDIT LIMIT: You agree not to let the Account balance exceed the credit limit established for you by us from time to time. We do not have to honor any use of your Card or honor credit card checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit, but if we do, you agree to repay the amount by which your credit limit is exceeded, plus Interest Charges immediately.
15. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of any merchant to accept or honor the Card or a credit card check.
16. SECURITY: Except as indicated below, you grant us a purchase money security interest in the goods purchased with your Card and in all insurance contracts and all proceeds, returned premiums,mechanical failure and extended service contracts, and refunds of charges for mechanical failure and extended service contracts financed therewith. Each good purchased on your Account will secure the entire Account balance until such good is paid in full. For purposes of determining which goods are subject to a security interest, payments received will be deemed to be applied first to any unpaid insurance premiums (if applicable), Interest Charges and fees and then to pay for purchases on the Account in the order in which they were made. When sufficient payments are made to repay the portion of the Account balance attributable to the purchase of a particular good, we will release our purchase money security interest in that good. Goods covered by a security interest may be taken from you if you do not pay on time. We may require you to make them available at a convenient place of our choice. We take no security interest in goods where the original purchase price is less than $200 if you live in New York and in goods where the original purchase price is less than $700 if you live in Maryland. If we repossess any goods purchased with your Card, we may charge you our repossession cost including, but not limited to, necessary repairs, storage fees and costs of sale, when and as permitted by law.
17. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Total Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your moving out of the U.S. or Canada or providing us with a non-U.S. or non-Canadian mailing address; (l) your becoming incompetent; (m) your exceeding your credit limit; (n) your payment being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (o) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (p) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.

You agree any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether based upon contract; tort, intentional or otherwise; constitution; statute; common law; or equity and whether preexisting, present or future), including initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third party claims, arising from or relating to (a) this Agreement, the application, your Account, any transaction or activity involving any payment or failure to make payment on your Account, or any solicitation, advertisement, promotion, or oral or written statements related to this Agreement or your Account, (b) the relationships which result from this Agreement and your relationship with any Covered Person pursuant to the criteria in the immediately preceding subsection or (c) the scope, validity or enforceability of this arbitration clause, any part thereof or the entire Agreement (any of the forgoing a ""Claim""), shall be resolved, upon the election of you, us, or any other Covered Person described below, by binding arbitration pursuant to this arbitration provision and the applicable rules or procedures of the arbitration administrator (the “Administrator”) selected at the time the Claim is filed or received by a party to the Claim. The party initiating the arbitration proceeding shall have the right to select one of the following Administrators: Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) or the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). The arbitrator shall be a lawyer with more than ten years experience or a retired or former judge. The rules and forms of JAMS and AAA may be obtained by writing to these organizations at the addresses listed under Further Information below. Our address for service of process under this provision is HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., P.O. Box 98740, Las Vegas, NV 89193-8740.
Small Claims Exemption
We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim you may bring in small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration at such time.
Location of Arbitration and Fees
Any participatory arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient to you.  On any Claim you file, you will pay the first $50 of the filing fee. At your request we will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the Administrator on any Claim submitted by you in arbitration up to a maximum of $1,500. If you are required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, we will consider a request by you to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, we shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees unless the arbitrator grants you an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in your favor, we will reimburse you for any additional fees paid or owed by you to the Administrator up  to the amount of the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual award in your favor. The parties shall bear the expense of their respective attorney's fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, or the fees paid to the Administrator, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein. If the arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the Administrator or for which we are responsible.
Covered Persons
This arbitration provision covers Claims by or against (a) us, any corporate parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, any predecessor or successor of the foregoing, and any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of any of the aforementioned, (b) you and any authorized user, and any other person claiming through you or any authorized user, and (c) any other person assisting us in offering Cards, administering Accounts or providing Card related benefits or services (“Covered Persons”). If a Claim that is within the scope of the first paragraph of the “Claims and Arbitration Administrators” paragraph above is advanced by or against any third person, and any of the persons mentioned in the previous sentence is involved as a party, then the entire Claim is subject to arbitration under this Agreement, including any Claim by or against any third person.
Protection of Information
The rules and procedures of the Administrator, which you may obtain from that organization, shall govern the arbitration unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will control. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, nor to state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. If you or we request, the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized under applicable law and will use best efforts to protect confidential information (including through use of protective orders).
Parties to Arbitration
Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.”
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver.  You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules. In the event of such an appeal, an appeal panel consisting of three arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The panel's decision will be final and binding. Any final decision of the arbitrator or of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as provided under the FAA. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the FAA by any court having jurisdiction.
Consequences of Electing Arbitration
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY EITHER PARTY.

Terms and Conditions
How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called ""average daily balance (including new purchases)"".
Billing Rights: Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided in this Cardholder Agreement.
You may pay the entire New Balance on your Account at any time.
NOTICE FOR MARRIED WISCONSIN RESIDENTS: No provision of a marital property agreement, unilateral statement under Section 766.59 of the Wisconsin Statutes, or court order under Section 766.70 of the Wisconsin Statutes adversely affects the interest of the creditor unless the creditor, prior to the time the credit is granted, is furnished a copy of the agreement, statement or decree or has actual knowledge of the adverse provision when the obligation to the creditor is incurred. If you are married, by submitting your credit card application you are confirming that this credit card obligation is being incurred in the interest of your marriage and your family. If the credit card for which you are applying is granted, you will notify the Bank if you have a spouse who needs to receive notification that credit has been extended to you.
CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
1. GENERAL: Each person signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application for a credit card account (“Account”) as applicant or joint applicant applies for an Account with HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., a national banking association, and requests one or more credit card(s) bearing the name or tradename of Furniture Row to be used in connection with the Account. The word “Card” means any credit card(s) issued to you or an authorized user of your Account. In this Agreement, the words “you” and “your” refer to the applicant and joint applicant named on the credit card application and the words “we”, “us” and “our” refer to HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., located at 1111 Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144.
If based on your creditworthiness, we determine you do not qualify for Program A, you agree we may consider you for an account with the terms and conditions of Program B. If approved for Program B, you agree to its terms and conditions.
If your application is approved, “applicant” will be referred to as “primary cardholder” and “joint applicant” will be referred to as “secondary cardholder” for purposes of this agreement.
If we accept your application to open an Account, you agree that you will only purchase goods and services for personal, family and household purposes from merchants which honor the Card.
2. ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT: By a) signing and submitting, or electronically or telephonically submitting the application, using or permitting others to use the Card, b) signing or permitting others to sign sales slips; or c) making or permitting others to make purchases by telephone, Internet, or any other means, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Cardholder Agreement and Disclosure Statement, which includes an arbitration provision.
3. PROMISE TO PAY: You agree to pay all amounts charged to the Account, whether incurred by you or anyone you authorize or permit to use your Account or Card. If the Account is a joint Account, the applicant and joint applicant each agree to pay and are jointly and individually responsible for all amounts charged on the Account regardless of any divorce or other legal proceedings or any agreement that may affect liability between the applicant and the joint applicant. If either of you give us notice disclaiming liability for amounts owed under this Agreement, we may close the Account. In that event, you will continue to pay the outstanding balance under the terms of this Agreement. However, you will not be able to make any new charges on the Account.
4. ABILITY TO REPAY: When you use the Account or permit others to use the Account, you represent that you have the ability and intention to repay all amounts charged to the Account.
5. BILLING STATEMENT: We will send you a billing statement monthly for each billing cycle at the end of which you have a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00, or in which an Interest Charge has been imposed. The billing statement will show all purchases, Interest Charges and other charges or fees, including credit insurance or debt cancellation (if applicable), and all payments and other credits posted to your Account during the billing cycle. The billing statement will show the amount owed on your Account. The total Amount owed is called “New Balance” on your billing statement subject to the terms of Promotional Credit Plan purchases, if any, as indicated below.
6. PROMOTIONAL CREDIT PLANS: The following Promotional Credit Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase: a) Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan – no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase for a specified period, as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; b) Same As Cash/Monthly Payment Credit Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase before the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no Interest Charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, Interest Charges will be imposed from the purchase date; c) Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; d) Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan – A special repayment factor will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle; e) Special Repayment Factor/Reduced Rate Credit Plan – A special repayment factor and a reduced periodic rate will be applied to the purchase for the specified period as long as the Minimum Payment Due is paid when due each billing cycle.  All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Credit Plan are referred to as Regular Credit Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Card. Call 1-888-367-4310 or review the Application of Payments section of this Agreement for information.
7. INTEREST CHARGES: (a) Interest Charges are calculated separately for each Promotional Credit Plan and each Regular Credit Plan (each a “Credit Plan”). Promotional Credit Plans with different promotional due dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. The total Interest Charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the Interest Charge for each Credit Plan, subject to the minimum Interest Charge under Section 8.
(b) Interest Charges are imposed on purchases from the transaction date until paid in full, except that no Interest Charge is imposed in a billing cycle on:
(i) a new purchase on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(ii) any balance on a Regular, Reduced Rate, or Special Repayment Factor Credit Plan if the combined Previous Balance of those Credit Plans at the beginning of the cycle is zero or a credit balance, or is paid in full before the Payment Due Date that falls during the cycle;
(iii) a purchase on a Waived Interest Charge Credit Plan for the specified promotional period;
(iv) a purchase on a Same As Cash Credit Plan if the full cash sales price is paid in full before the promotion expiration date.
(c) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Credit Plan other than a Same As Cash Credit Plan, the amount will be determined by multiplying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate times the Daily Balance for the Credit Plan for each day in the cycle, and adding the results of those calculations together.
(d) If an Interest Charge is imposed on a Same As Cash Credit Plan during a cycle, the amount will be the sum of the following daily Interest Charge calculations for the Credit Plan during the current cycle and during each of the prior billing cycles (each a “Prior Cycle”) from the transaction date of the purchase through the current cycle: (i) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for the Current Cycle times the Daily Balance for each day in the current cycle; and (ii) the applicable Daily Periodic Rate for each Prior Cycle times the Daily Balances of the Credit Plan for each day during each Prior Cycle.
(e) The “Daily Balance” of a Credit Plan is determined by taking the opening balance of the Credit Plan for that day, and adding 1) any new purchases made on the Credit Plan that day, 2) the previous day’s Interest Charges, 3) any credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) incurred on that day and 4) any late fees, over the credit limit fees, returned payment fees or other fees incurred on that day and subtracting any payments or credits applied to the Credit Plan that day. If your Account is subject to a grace period during the billing cycle, payments made during that cycle will be subtracted from all Daily Balances in the current cycle. For any Same As Cash Credit Plan, credit insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable) are not included in the Daily Balance of that Credit Plan during the promotional period. If a transaction for a returned payment or a dispute resolved in our favor posts after the beginning of the billing cycle, the applicable Daily Balance(s) and any related Interest Charge calculations will be adjusted retroactively to include the transaction amount as of the date of the original transaction.
(f) The Daily Periodic Rate for the Standard Rate will be .07370% (corresponding 26.9% Annual Percentage Rate). The Daily Periodic Rate for the Penalty Rate will be .08192% (corresponding 29.9% Annual Percentage Rate). Your APR may increase to the Penalty APR if we fail to receive your minimum payment with in 60 days when due. You will no longer be eligible for the Standard Rate and all existing Promotional Credit Plans will terminate, and your entire Account balance will be subject to the Penalty Rate. If your Account becomes subject to the Penalty APR, we will provide advance notice before the new Penalty APR goes into effect.  If you make the next six consecutive on time minimum payments starting with your first payment due once the Penalty APR goes into effect, your rates will return to the non-penalty APR(s) applicable to your Account.  If you do not make these six consecutive on time minimum payments, we may keep the Penalty APR on your Account indefinitely.
8. MINIMUM Interest CHARGE: A minimum Interest Charge of $2.00 will be assessed for each billing cycle in which an Interest Charge is payable.
9. FEES: We may impose on your Account the following fees, which will be added to your Account when assessed:
a)	Late Payment Fee: A Late Payment Fee may be assessed for each billing cycle in which at least the Minimum Payment Due, including any amount past due, is not paid in time to be credited to the Account by the Payment Due Date.
	The amount of the Late Payment Fee is shown in the chart below.  In no event will your Late Payment Fee exceed the amount of your Minimum Payment Due.

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - Up to and including $100
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $25

Outstanding Balance on Payment Due Date - More than $100
Late Payment Fee - first time your payment is late. $25
Late Payment Fee -  if another payment is late during the next 6 billing cycles. $35

b)	Returned Payment Fee: A Returned Payment Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment check, automatic payment deduction, or other payment method is not honored or is returned unsatisfied by your bank or other financial institution. Any payment returned unsatisfied for any reason may be reposted to any type of transaction (i.e. purchases, etc.) and Interest Charges may be reinstated back to the payment date at the APR being charged for that transaction.
	Your Returned Payment Fee is $25.
	In no event will your Returned Payment Fee exceed the Minimum Payment Due.
c)	Research Fees: A Research Fee may be assessed to the Account for each copy of a requested document. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such copies are requested.
d)	Reissued Card Fee: You may be charged $5 each time you request that your credit card be reissued.
e)	Payment by Phone Fee: A Payment by Phone Fee may be assessed to the Account each time a payment is made by telephone, even if the payment is made by someone other than you. The amount of this fee will be disclosed at the time such payment is requested.
f)	Over the Credit Limit Fee: In the event you exceed your credit limit, you will be charged an Over the Credit Limit Fee of $0.
g)	Collection Costs: If, after you default, we refer your Account to an attorney and/or collection agency for collection, we may charge you our collection costs, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, when and as permitted by applicable law.
10. INSURANCE: If available and you elect any credit insurance coverage, you authorize us to charge the insurance premium for such insurance to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the insurance premium is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the premium is being assessed. Credit insurance charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
11. DEBT CANCELLATION: If available and you elect debt cancellation, you authorize us to charge the fee for such debt cancellation to your Account on a monthly basis. You understand the amount of the debt cancellation fee is based on the Average Daily Balances of your Account for the billing cycle in which the fee is being assessed. Debt cancellation charges begin to accrue on the transaction date for all purchases made on your Account.
12. MINIMUM PAYMENT: You agree to pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due, reflected on your statement. If you wish, you may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due and at any time you may pay the entire amount due. To obtain your Minimum Payment Due, we add the following amounts (1+2+3):
1) Any delinquent amount you owe us from a previous cycle;
2) the greater of
a.) 4% of your “Minimum Payment Balance” (which is your “new Balance” less balances on Special Repayment Factor Credit Plans)
or
b.) 1% of your Minimum Payment Balance plus Current billed Interest Charges and current Late Fees, plus the Special Repayment Factors for any Promotional Credit Plans with Special Repayment Factors, rounded to the next highest dollar. If this amount is less than $40, we will use $40;
3) any debt cancellation fees or credit insurance premiums attributable to Promotional Credit Plans with Reduced Rate/Special Repayment Factors. Your monthly billing statement will include requirements for you to follow in making payments including the cut-off hour for receipt of payments, which may affect crediting of your payments.
13. PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS: All payments must be mailed or delivered to us at the Payment Processing Center address shown on your monthly billing statement. All payments must be made by check or money order. By sending us a check for payment on your account, you authorize us either to use information from your check to initiate an electronic fund transfer from your account according to the terms of the check or to process this transaction as a check.  When we use your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your bank. If you do not want your checks to be converted to an electronic fund transfer, please call Customer Service. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) not drawn in U.S. dollars on funds on deposit in the U.S.; (b) missing a signature; (c) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (d) restrictively endorsed; (e) postdated; (f) drawn on a credit account issued by HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. or an affiliate; (g) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to HSBC Retail Services, P.O. Box 5226, Carol Stream, IL 60197-5226. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance.
14. APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: Your payments are applied in a manner we determine in accordance with applicable law. We apply the amount of your payment equal to the Minimum Payment Due at our discretion and generally to the Minimum Payment Due calculated on each credit plan. We apply any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due on your account to higher APR balances before lower APR balances. If you have a Same As Cash Credit Plan(s), we will automatically apply payments received during the final two complete billing cycles and up to the date of expiration first to the required Minimum Payment Due and next to the plan(s) that is expiring, in the order of expiration; at other times, we will treat your Same As Cash Credit Plan as having a 0% APR for purposes of determining payment application.
15. CREDIT LIMIT: You agree not to let the Account balance exceed the credit limit established for you by us from time to time. We do not have to honor any use of your Card or honor credit card checks which would cause you to exceed your credit limit, but if we do, you agree to repay the amount by which your credit limit is exceeded, plus Interest Charges immediately.
16. CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS: Some purchases will require our prior authorization and you may be asked by the merchant to provide identification. If our authorization system is not working, we may not be able to authorize a transaction, even if you have sufficient available credit. We will not be liable to you if any of these events happen. We are not responsible for the refusal of any merchant to accept or honor the Card or a credit card check.
17. SECURITY: Except as indicated below, you grant us a purchase money security interest in the goods purchased with your Card and in all insurance contracts and all proceeds, returned premiums, mechanical failure and extended service contracts, and refunds of charges for mechanical failure and extended service contracts financed therewith. Each good purchased on your Account will secure the entire Account balance until such good is paid in full. For purposes of determining which goods are subject to a security interest, payments received will be deemed to be applied first to any unpaid insurance premiums or debt cancellation fees (if applicable), Interest Charges and fees and then to pay for purchases on the Account in the order in which they were made. When sufficient payments are made to repay the portion of the Account balance attributable to the purchase of a particular good, we will release our purchase money security interest in that good. Goods covered by a security interest may be taken from you if you do not pay on time. We may require you to make them available at a convenient place of our choice. We take no security interest in goods where the original purchase price is less than $200 if you live in New York and in goods where the original purchase price is less than $700 if you live in Maryland. If we repossess any goods purchased with your Card, we may charge you our repossession cost including, but not limited to, necessary repairs, storage fees and costs of sale, when and as permitted by law.
18. DEFAULT: You will be in default under this Agreement upon: (a) your failure to make at least the Minimum Payment Due when due; (b) your violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (c) your death; (d) your becoming the subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (e) your becoming the subject of attachment, foreclosure, repossession, lien, judgement or garnishment proceedings; (f) your supplying us with misleading, false, incomplete or incorrect information; (g) our receipt of information that you are unable or unwilling to perform the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (h) your failure to supply us with any information we reasonably deem necessary; (i) our receipt of information from third parties, including credit reporting agencies, which indicates a delinquency or charge-off with other creditors; (j) your default under any other loan or agreement you have with us or any of our affiliates; (k) your moving out of the U.S. or Canada or providing us with a non-U.S. or non-Canadian mailing address; (l) your becoming incompetent; (m) your exceeding your credit limit; (n) your payment being returned unpaid by your bank for any reason; (o) any credit card check being returned unpaid by us; or (p) your being in default under any other agreement or security agreement you have with us or with one of our affiliates.
Upon default, we have the right to (a) terminate your credit privileges under this Agreement, (b) terminate any Promotional Credit Plans and convert balances to a Regular Credit Plan, (c) require you to pay your entire Account balance including Promotional Credit Plan balances, all accrued but unpaid Interest Charges and other charges provided for in this Agreement immediately and (d) bring an action to collect all amounts owed.
19. ARBITRATION: 
Federal Arbitration Act
This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1 - 16 (the ""FAA""). The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and provide written reasoned findings of fact and conclusions of law upon written request as set forth in the applicable arbitration association procedures. The arbitrator's award shall not be subject to appeal except as permitted by the FAA. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Claims and Arbitration Administrators
This arbitration provision shall apply to any Claim (defined below) by or against us, or you or any other Covered Person (defined below). You agree any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether based upon contract; tort, intentional or otherwise; constitution; statute; common law; or equity and whether preexisting, present or future), including initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third party claims, arising from or relating to (a) this Agreement, the application, your Account, any transaction or activity involving any payment or failure to make payment on your Account, or any solicitation, advertisement, promotion, or oral or written statements related to this Agreement or your Account, (b) the relationships which result from this Agreement and your relationship with any Covered Person pursuant to the criteria in the immediately preceding subsection or (c) the scope, validity or enforceability of this arbitration clause, any part thereof or the entire Agreement (any of the forgoing a ""Claim""), shall be resolved, upon the election of you, us, or any other Covered Person described below, by binding arbitration pursuant to this arbitration provision and the applicable rules or procedures of the arbitration administrator (the “Administrator”) selected at the time the Claim is filed or received by a party to the Claim. The party initiating the arbitration proceeding shall have the right to select one of the following Administrators: Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) or the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). The arbitrator shall be a lawyer with more than ten years experience or a retired or former judge. The rules and forms of JAMS and AAA may be obtained by writing to these organizations at the addresses listed under Further Information below. Our address for service of process under this provision is HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., P.O. Box 98740, Las Vegas, NV 89193-8740.
Small Claims Exemption
We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate an individual Claim you may bring in small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration at such time.
Location of Arbitration and Fees
Any participatory arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient to you. On any Claim you file, you will pay the first $50 of the filing fee. At your request we will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the Administrator on any Claim submitted by you in arbitration up to a maximum of $1,500. If you are required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, we will consider a request by you to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, we shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees unless the arbitrator grants you an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in your favor, we will reimburse you for any additional fees paid or owed by you to the Administrator up to the amount of the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual award in your favor. The parties shall bear the expense of their respective attorney's fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, or the fees paid to the Administrator, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein. If the arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the Administrator or for which we are responsible.
Covered Persons
This arbitration provision covers Claims by or against (a) us, any corporate parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, any predecessor or successor of the foregoing, and any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of any of the aforementioned, (b) you and any authorized user, and any other person claiming through you or any authorized user, and (c) any other person assisting us in offering Cards, administering Accounts or providing Card related benefits or services (“Covered Persons”). If a Claim that is within the scope of the first paragraph of the “Claims and Arbitration Administrators” paragraph above is advanced by or against any third person, and any of the persons mentioned in the previous sentence is involved as a party, then the entire Claim is subject to arbitration under this Agreement, including any Claim by or against any third person.
Protection of Information
The rules and procedures of the Administrator, which you may obtain from that organization, shall govern the arbitration unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will control. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court, nor to state or local laws that relate to arbitration proceedings. If you or we request, the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized under applicable law and will use best efforts to protect confidential information (including through use of protective orders).
Parties to Arbitration
Arbitration shall be conducted in the name of individually named parties. Unless all parties consent, neither you nor we may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims regarding two or more accounts, individuals, or account holders in the same arbitration, other than Covered Persons, joint applicants or authorized users of an account. There shall be no class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative or collective actions, in an arbitration, even if the underlying dispute has been asserted in a court as a class action, private attorney general action, or other representative or collective action. No party may advance a Claim in arbitration on behalf of or against a person in a representative or collective capacity, or on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party to the arbitration; nor may a party seek an award or benefit in arbitration on behalf of or against a person who is not an individually named party. The arbitrator shall not have authority to resolve any claim advanced by or on behalf of anyone who is not an individually named party, and shall not have the authority to make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone who is not an individually named party. No class actions or joinder or consolidation of any Claim with the claim of any other person are permitted in arbitration without the express written consent of you and us. These limitations are hereafter referred to as the “Class Action Waiver.” 
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from this arbitration provision. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver. You and we acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
Decision and Appeal
The arbitrator shall resolve all Claims, including the applicability of this arbitration provision or the validity of the entire Agreement, except for any Claim challenging the validity of the Class Action Waiver, which shall be decided by a court. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding unless you or we seek an appeal of the award by making a written request to the Administrator within the timeframe specified in the Administrator’s rules. In the event of such an appeal, an appeal panel consisting of three arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The panel's decision will be final and binding. Any final decision of the arbitrator or of the appeal panel is subject to judicial review only as provided under the FAA. An award in arbitration will be enforceable under the FAA by any court having jurisdiction.
Consequences of Electing Arbitration
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY EITHER PARTY.

How To Avoid Paying Interest 
Your due date is at least 23 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any interest on 
purchases if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month. We will begin charging interest on 
cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date. 

Minimum Interest Charge If you are charged interest, the charge will be no less than $2. 

Maintenance Fees $.99 per month ($11.88 maximum annually); waived when your account has an ending 
balance of zero 

Penalty Fees

Up to $35 
 
Returned Payment 
Up to $35 


How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called �daily balance�. 

During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying 
the periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following 
balance types, as applicable: purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or 
special promotions. 

� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees 
posted that day, and subtract any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type.

GE MONEY BANK 
CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT 


1. CONTRACT. This Agreement (�Agreement�) is a contract for the extension of credit. It controls your credit card account referenced on the document received with your credit card or 
on your welcome letter. This Agreement includes this document and the following documents: 
� The application or any other document you submitted to us in connection with the account; and 
� The privacy policy that is enclosed with or attached to this document. 
By opening or using your account, you agree to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement starts when (i) you give us an account application we approve or (ii) you use your account or 
let someone else use it, whichever occurs first. 

2. PARTIES. The parties to this Agreement are you and GE Money Bank. GE Money Bank is located at 170 West Election Road, Suite 125, Draper, Utah 84020. GE Money Bank 
sometimes is called �us,� �we� or �our� in this Agreement. 

3. PROMISE TO PAY. You promise to pay us for all credit that we extend on your account, including credit extended when you let another person use your account. You also promise to 
pay us for all other amounts owed to us under this Agreement. 

4. CHANGING TERMS. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may change, add to or delete any of the terms of this Agreement, including the interest rates, 

fees and charges. 
5. GOVERNING LAW. Except as provided in the Dispute and Claim Resolution (Including Arbitration) provision, this Agreement and your account are governed by federal 
law and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of Utah without regard to its conflicts of law principles. This Agreement has been accepted by us in Utah. 

6. CREDIT CARD. We have issued or will send you a credit card for your use. You are not permitted to allow anyone else to use your credit card, but if you do, you will be responsible 
for such use. You will destroy all the credit card(s) issued on your account if we ask you to do so. 

7. AUTHORIZED USER/JOINT ACCOUNT. If you ask us to send a credit card to another person that you want to let use your account, you will be responsible for all transactions made 
by that person. That person will be considered an authorized user. If another person is approved on the account, that person will be considered a joint accountholder. Each joint 
accountholder may use the account and agrees to the terms of this Agreement. No matter which joint accountholder uses the account, each of you must pay back the full amount owed 
on the account. We may treat each of you as one accountholder. For example, giving notice to one of you is considered the same as giving notice to both of you. Also, we may follow the 
instructions that we get from one of you even if they differ from instructions given by the other accountholder. 

8. USING YOUR ACCOUNT. You may use your account only as stated in this Agreement. You may use your account for the following: 
� Purchases. You may buy goods or services; 
� Cash Advances. If applicable, you may get cash advances by writing convenience checks we may provide to you from time to time or by other means we may make available. We 
may not honor a convenience check (i) if you filed for bankruptcy, (ii) if the check is expired, (iii) if your account is closed, (iv) if the amount of the check would exceed your available 
credit or cash advance limit, or (v) as otherwise stated on your convenience check; and 
� Balance Transfers. If applicable, from time to time, we may offer you the chance to transfer balances from your other credit card accounts to this account. Unless we tell you 
otherwise, we will treat balance transfers as purchases. We reserve the right to decline to process any balance transfer request for any reason, and will not transfer a balance from 
any of our affiliates. Transfers will be processed in the order determined by us. If the amount you wish to transfer is greater than your available credit limit, we may reject the 
request(s). It may take up to four weeks for a balance transfer request to be credited to your other credit card account(s). It is your responsibility to make any payments required to 
keep your other account(s) current and to close your other account(s), if you desire. We are not responsible for any charges you may incur on your other account(s) as a result of 
your balance transfer(s). If you have a dispute with a creditor, and pay the balance in question by transferring it to your account, you may lose certain dispute rights. 

You may use your account only for lawful personal, family or household purposes. You may not use your account for internet gambling or illegal purposes. You may not use your account 
to pay amounts you owe us on this account or on other accounts you have with us. These restrictions are for our benefit, and we are not responsible to you for enforcing them. 

9. CREDIT AND CASH ADVANCE LIMITS. 
A. Assigning Limits. We will assign the following limit(s) on your account, as applicable. We may increase or decrease either or both of these limits at any time. 
Credit Limit � This is the highest amount of total credit we will extend to you on your account. 

Cash Advance Limit � This is the highest amount of credit we will extend to you for cash advances made on your account, if applicable. Cash transactions will also count 
towards your credit limit. 

B. Exceeding Limits. We may refuse to authorize you to use your account if that use (including any fees associated with that use) will cause the total you will owe on your account to 
be more than your credit limit. If applicable, you may not get a cash advance if that cash advance (including interest and cash advance fees) will cause the total you will owe for 
cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit. If we approve a transaction that causes the total you will owe on your account to be more than your credit 
limit or, if applicable, the total you will owe for cash advances on your account to be more than your cash advance limit, we do not give up any of our rights under this Agreement 
and we do not treat it as an increase in your credit limit or, if applicable, cash advance limit. 

C. Limiting Transactions. We reserve the right to not approve transactions on your account. To prevent fraud, we may also limit the number or dollar amount of transactions you can 
make in a particular amount of time. 

10. INTEREST. This section explains (i) the interest rates that will apply to your account, (ii) when interest will be charged on your account, and (iii) how the amount of interest is calculated. 
A. Rates. The following rates apply to purchases and, if applicable, cash advances. A higher rate, which we call a �Penalty APR� may apply at certain times as described below. The 
Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) applicable to your account are shown in the table above and will also be shown on your billing statement. 
We calculate interest on the balance of your account each day. We use a daily rate to calculate the interest each day. The daily rate is equal to the APR divided by 365. 

1. Purchase Rate. The daily rate for purchases is .08216% (APR 29.99%) unless and until the penalty rate applies. 
2. Cash Advance Rate. Not applicable. 
3. Penalty Rate. The penalty rate may apply if you do not make your total minimum payment by the payment due date and will continue to apply as provided in this section. As 
required by law, we will provide you with advance notice if we are going to apply the penalty rate to your account and we will tell you when the penalty rate will apply. 
a. What is the Penalty Rate? The daily penalty rate will be .08216% (APR 29.99%). 
b. How Long Will the Penalty Rate Apply? If you are not more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to transactions made on your account after a date 
specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make all required payments by the payment due date for six consecutive billing periods, your rate will return to the 
standard APR; otherwise, the penalty rate will apply indefinitely. 
If you are or become more than 60 days late on a payment, the penalty rate will apply to all balances and new transactions on your account not already subject to the penalty 
rate as specified in the advance notice. Once in effect, if you then make six consecutive minimum payments by the payment due date, starting with your first payment 
due date after the date specified in the advance notice, your rate for any balances created on your account prior to or within 14 days after the date of the advance 
notice that are not already subject to (or scheduled under a prior notice to be subject to) the penalty rate will return to the standard APR. If you do not make these six 
consecutive minimum payments, we may apply the penalty rate to all balances on your account indefinitely. 

B. When We Charge Interest. 
1. Purchases. We charge interest on your purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full, except as set forth below: 
� We will not charge you interest during a billing cycle on any purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the billing cycle or (ii) you had such a balance, you paid 
that balance in full by the due date in that billing cycle. 
� We will credit, as of the beginning of the billing cycle, any payment you make by the due date that we allocate to purchases if (i) you had no balance at the beginning of the 
previous billing cycle, or (ii) if you had such a balance, you paid that balance in full by the due date in the previous billing cycle. 

2. Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. If applicable, we charge interest on your balance transfers and cash advances (and their related fees) from the date you make the 
transaction until you pay them in full. You cannot avoid paying interest on balance transfers or cash advances or on their fees. 

C. How We Calculate Interest. During billing cycles in which interest is charged, for each balance type on your account we figure the interest charge on your account by applying the 
periodic rate to the �daily balance� of your account for each day in the billing cycle. A separate daily balance will be calculated for the following balance types, as applicable: 
purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and other balances that are subject to different interest rates, plans or special promotions. 
� First, we determine the �daily balance�. To determine the daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new charges and fees posted that day, and subtract 
any payments and credits posted that day. This gives us the daily balance. 
� Second, we calculate the amount of interest charged. To do this, we multiply the applicable daily rate by each daily balance on your account. 
� Third, we add the interest amount to the daily balance, and the sum will become the beginning balance for the following day. 
Your interest charge for the billing cycle is the sum of the interest amounts that were charged each day during the billing cycle for each balance type. We charge a minimum of $2 of 
interest in any billing cycle in which you owe interest. 

11. FEES. We may charge some or all of the following fees. The table at the beginning of this Agreement shows the amount of each of the maintenance, transaction and penalty fees. 
A. A monthly Maintenance Fee each month your account is open and has a balance greater than zero. 

B. Penalty Fees. 
1. A Late Payment Fee if we do not receive at least the total minimum payment due on your account by 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the due date shown on your statement. The amount 
of the late payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if you have paid at least your total minimum payment due by the payment due date in each of the prior six billing cycles or 
(2) $35 if you have failed to pay at least the total minimum payment due by the payment due date in any one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the late 
payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for which the late payment fee is assessed, the amount of the late payment fee will instead be equal to the 
amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 
2. A Returned Payment Fee if any check or other instrument sent to us, or any electronic payment authorization you provide us in payment on your account, is not honored 
upon first presentment, even if the check, instrument or electronic authorization is later honored. The amount of the returned payment fee will be equal to: (1) $25 if 
your payments have been honored upon first presentment in each of the prior six billing cycles or (2) $35 if any payment has been dishonored upon first presentment in any 
one or more of the prior six billing cycles. However, if the returned payment fee would exceed the total minimum payment for the cycle in which the payment was dishonored 
upon first presentment, the amount of the returned payment fee will instead be equal to the amount of the total minimum payment that was due. 

12. YOUR PAYMENTS. 
A. Required Payment and Crediting of Payment. Each billing cycle you must pay at least the total minimum payment by 5:00 pm (ET) on the payment due date. You may at any 
time pay more than the total minimum payment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payment may reduce the amount of interest you will pay. Any payments received 
after 5:00 pm (ET) will be credited as of the next day. We may delay making credit available on your account in the amount of your payment. 

B. Minimum Payment. Your total minimum payment will be calculated as shown below. We round up to the next highest whole dollar in figuring your total minimum payment. In 
addition, if your new balance on your billing statement is less than $25, then your total minimum payment will be equal to the new balance. Your minimum payment will be: 
1. The sum of the following: 
(a) The greater of either: 
(i) $25; or 
(ii) 3.75% of the new balance shown on your billing statement (excluding any balance attributable to any special promotion that involves delayed or 
special payments); PLUS 
(b) Any past due amounts; PLUS 
(c) Any payment due in connection with a specific promotional purchase. 

2. If you are charged a late payment fee during a billing cycle, for the next four months, we will make the following calculation each month as long as you make at least the initial 
minimum payment each month. We will calculate if the total of your payments is at least equal to the sum of the following: (A) the interest billed on your statement each month, 
plus (B) 1% of the new balance shown on your billing statement each month (excluding any balance attributable to any special promotion that involves delayed or special 
payments), plus (C) the late payment fee that was assessed in the billing cycle before the four month period. If for the four month period the sum of your payments is not at least 
equal to the sum of A, B and C, then your minimum payment for future billing cycles will be the greater of either: 
(a) the minimum payment calculation shown in (1) above; or 
(b) the sum of: 
(i) 1% of the new balance shown on your billing statement (excluding any balance attributable to any special promotion that involves delayed or special 
payments) plus interest and late payment fees charged to your account in the current billing cycle; PLUS 
(ii) Any past due amounts; PLUS 
(iii) Any payment due in connection with a specific promotional purchase. 

C. How to Make a Payment. To make a payment you must follow all the instructions below and the instructions on your billing statement. If you do not follow these instructions, credit 
of your payment to your account may be delayed up to five days. 
1. Do the following: (a) make your payment in United States dollars by check, money order, or similar instrument from a bank located in the U.S; (b) send the payment coupon 
from your billing statement with your payment; (c) send the payment and payment coupon in the envelope provided with your billing statement to the payment address listed on 
your billing statement; and (d) send only one payment and one payment coupon in each envelope. Alternatively you may make your payment online at the website address 
shown on your billing statement provided you make your payment in United States dollars from a bank located in the U.S. 
2. Do not do the following: (a) staple, paper clip, tape or fold your payment or payment coupon; (b) include any other papers or items with your payment; (c) use a balance 
transfer or convenience check from your account to pay us; or (d) send us cash. 

D. Other Ways to Make a Payment. Certain participating stores or providers may take payments that you make to them as a convenience to you. We may not credit those payments 
to your account until we receive them. We may allow you to make payments over the phone as an accommodation to you, but we may charge you a fee to do so. 

E. Disputed Amounts. If you send us correspondence about a disputed amount, you must send it to the address for billing inquiries shown on your billing statement. 
You may not send it to the payment address shown on your billing statement. By �disputed amount,� we mean a payment of less than the full balance on your account 
that is labeled as �payment in full� or similar language, or is given to us as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, or is given to us with other conditions or limitations. 
We may accept these types of payments without giving up any of our rights. 

F. Authorization. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or 
to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon 
as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. 

G. Payment Allocation. We reserve the right to select the method by which the required minimum payment is allocated to different balances on your account. Some or all of the 
required minimum payment on your account will be applied to lower APR balances before higher APR balances. The payment allocation method that we use may result in higher 
interest on your account or reduced savings attributable to any special promotions. Any payment you make in excess of the required minimum payment will be allocated to 
balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs, unless applicable law requires or permits otherwise (such as when your account has a certain type of special 
promotion). 

13. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS. At times, we may offer you special promotions when you use your account for certain transactions. These special promotions will have some terms that 
are different from the terms in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement apply to any special promotion, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the special promotion. We 
may terminate your participation in any special promotion and/or apply the penalty rate to your account balances (including special promotion balances) if you become more than 60 days 
late on any payment due on your account. If this happens, each special promotion balance will no longer be subject to the terms of the special promotion and will instead be subject to the 
terms of this Agreement. A promotional charge may be charged as part of a special promotion. Please see any special promotion advertising (including in-store signs) or other disclosures 
provided to you for the full terms of any special promotion offered. 

14. SECURITY INTEREST. You grant us a purchase money security interest in each item of merchandise purchased on your account to secure its unpaid purchase price until such 
merchandise is paid in full. Solely for the purpose of determining the extent of our purchase money security interest in each such item of merchandise, your payments will be allocated 
first to interest on the account, and then to pay off each purchase on the account in the order in which the purchase was made (if more than one item was purchased on the same day, 
your payments will be allocated to pay off the lowest priced item first). If you made a purchase pursuant to a credit promotion, the balance with respect to the promotional purchase may 
be shown on statements during the promotional period and may reflect a different payment allocation method. In no event will we assert a security interest in the promotional purchase for 
an amount greater than the lowest balance shown on a statement for that promotional purchase. We agree that no security interest is or will be retained or acquired under this agreement 
in any real property which is used or is expected to be used as your dwelling. Should we feel it necessary, you authorize us to sign and file financing statements regarding any vehicle 
purchased. 

For some individual purchases under your account, we may require you to maintain property/casualty insurance on the purchase as a condition of granting you credit. You will be 
informed of any property/casualty insurance requirement at the time you make the purchase. 

15. UNAUTHORIZED USE. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should call us immediately at 1-866-396-8254. 

You will not be liable for any unauthorized use on your account. 

You agree that unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given your card or allowed use of your account. You will be responsible for all use by such a 
person. 

16. YOUR CREDIT REPORTS AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION. 
A. Using and Sharing Your Information. When you applied for an account you gave us information about yourself. You also agreed that we could ask others for information about 
your creditworthiness and that we could ask consumer reporting agencies for your consumer report. We use this information in considering your application. We also use this 
information for any updates, renewals or extensions of credit on your account. We use this information to review and collect your account. We use this information to provide you 
with offers. We may give information about you or your account to consumer reporting agencies and other proper parties. This information may include your performance under this 
Agreement. 

B. Inaccurate Information. Tell us if you think we reported wrong information about you to a consumer reporting agency (also called a credit bureau). Write to us at P.O. 
Box 981439, El Paso, TX 79998-1439. In your written communication, tell us what information is wrong and why you think it is wrong. If you have a copy of the credit 
report that includes the wrong information, send a copy of it with your written communication. We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late 
payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. 

17. USE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOUR ACCOUNT. We will give information about you and your account to dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals 
that accept this credit card (and their affiliates) and you consent to this. Dealers/merchants/retailers and participating professionals will use the information in connection with the credit 
card program and for things like creating and updating their records and offering you special benefits. We will use information about you and your account as set forth in the privacy policy 
that is attached to or enclosed with this document. 

18. CHANGE OF ADDRESS/PHONE NUMBER. You agree to tell us right away if you change your address or phone number(s). We will contact you at the address in our records until 
we are able to update our records with your new address. 

19. CONSENT TO COMMUNICATIONS. You consent to us contacting you using all channels of communication and for all purposes (including collection purposes), using all contact 
information you provide to us. You also consent to us and any other owner or servicer of your account contacting you about your account, including using text messages, any automatic 
telephone dialing system and/or an artificial or prerecorded voice when contacting you, even if you are charged for the call under your phone plan. You are responsible for any charges for 
contacting you that may be billed to you by your communications carriers. 

20. TELEPHONE MONITORING. For quality control purposes, you permit us to listen to or record telephone calls between you and us. 

21. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT. 
A. When You May Close Your Account. 
You may close your account at any time by writing or calling us and asking us to close your account. You must send this writing to the 
address shown on your billing statement or call us at the customer service number shown on your billing statement. We will close your account after we get your request. 

B. When We May Close Your Account. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may close your account at any time and for any reason. 

C. After You or We Close Your Account. If you or we close your account, you must stop using it. You will still have to pay us the full amount you owe on your account. This 
Agreement controls your account until you pay it in full. 

22. DEFAULT. Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, you are in default if you: 
� Make a late payment; 
� Do not follow any other term of this Agreement; or 
� Become bankrupt or insolvent. 
If you default or upon your death, we may, subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law: (i) make the full amount owing on your account due right away; (ii) bring a legal 
action to collect all amounts owed; and/or (iii) take any action allowed by law. We may also reduce your credit limit or close your account at anytime whether or not you are in default. 

23. COLLECTION COSTS. If we ask an attorney to collect your account, we may charge you our collection costs. Collection costs may include court costs, reasonable attorneys� fees 
and fees for repossession, repair, storage and sale of any vehicle securing a purchase. We will charge these costs only if the attorney we ask to collect is not our salaried employee and 
the law allows us to do so. 

24. DISPUTE AND CLAIM RESOLUTION (INCLUDING ARBITRATION) PROVISION. 
General/Requirement to Arbitrate. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION 
WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A 
COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS 
INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED. This Provision replaces any existing arbitration provision with us and will stay in force no matter 
what happens to your account, including termination. Upon demand, and except as otherwise provided below, you and we must arbitrate individually any dispute or claim between you, any joint cardholder and/or any additional cardholder, 
on the one hand; and us, our affiliates, agents and/or dealers/merchants/retailers or participating professionals, on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises from or relates to your 
account. However, we will not require you to arbitrate: (1) any individual case in small claims court or your state�s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court; or 
(2) any claim by us that only involves our effort to collect money you owe us. However, if you respond to a collection lawsuit by claiming that we engaged in any wrongdoing, we may 
require you to arbitrate. 

YOU AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. ALSO, YOU 
MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ON BEHALF OF ANY CARDHOLDER WHO IS NOT A JOINT OR ADDITIONAL CARDHOLDER WITH YOU ON YOUR ACCOUNT (AN 
�UNRELATED CARDHOLDER�), AND YOU AGREE THAT NO UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY BRING ANY CLAIMS AGAINST US ON YOUR BEHALF. CLAIMS BY YOU AND 
BY AN UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY NOT BE JOINED IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. Only a court may decide whether any part of this paragraph is enforceable. If it is finally 
determined that this paragraph is not fully enforceable, only this sentence of the Provision will remain in force and the remainder of the Provision will be null and void, provided that the 
court�s determination concerning the enforceability of this paragraph shall be subject to appeal. 

Starting an Arbitration. If you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, the electing party must notify the other party in writing. This notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit and can be 
given in papers filed in the lawsuit. Otherwise, your notice must be sent to GE Money Bank, Legal Operation, 950 Forrer Boulevard, Kettering, OH 45420, ATTN: ARBITRATION 
DEMAND and our notice must be sent to the most recent address for you in our files. The party seeking arbitration must select as the arbitration administrator either the American

Variable Rate Information.

The following applies to any APR on your Account that varies with the market
based on the Prime Rate.  The APRs on your Account correspond to a Daily
Periodic Rate (""DPR"") or a Monthly Periodic Rate (""MPR"") which is applicable
only to residents of Iowa at the time of Account opening. The applicable
DPRs/MPRs on your Account equal 1/365th (or 1/12th for residents of Iowa at the
time of Account opening) of the sum of 1) the applicable Prime Rate, 2) plus
the margin(s) listed above for each Purchase, Balance Transfer, or Cash Advance
balance or the margin listed above if a Penalty APR applies. The ""Prime Rate""
used in determining the APRs in each billing cycle will be the highest rate
published in the Money Rates column of The Wall Street Journal on the last
business day of each month.  An increase or decrease in the Prime Rate will
cause a corresponding increase or decrease to your variable rates on the first
day of the billing cycle that begins in the same month in which the applicable
Prime Rate is published.  There is no limitation on the amount of any increase.
 Any such increase or decrease will cause a corresponding increase or decrease
in the amount of interest assessed and possibly in the amount of the Minimum
Payment Due.  If The Wall Street Journal does not publish the U.S. Prime Rate,
or if it changes the definition of the U.S. Prime Rate, we may substitute
another index.  As of 09-30-2011 the Prime Rate was 3.25%.

How the Penalty APR may apply to your Account.

The APRs on your Account may be increased each time you, on this Account or any
other account you may have with us, fail to make a payment to us when due, you
fail to pay at least the Minimum Payment Due, you exceed your credit line, or
you make a payment that is not honored by your bank.  If we increase the APRs
on your Account, we will notify you in advance of the increase.  The Penalty
APR that will be applied to your Account will be determined based on our review
of your credit history at the time of our review (including your credit
performance with other creditors). Our notice to you will include the effective
date of the APR increase and the balances to which the Penalty APR will be
applied.   If the Penalty APR is applied to your account, it may continue to
apply to new transactions indefinitely. However, the Penalty APR will cease to
apply to certain existing transactions if, after the Penalty APR goes into
effect, you make the next six consecutive minimum payments in a row when due.
If you do not make these six consecutive minimum payments, the Penalty APR may
continue to apply to new and existing transactions indefinitely.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance Subject to Interest Rate:

We use a method called ""daily balance (including new purchases)"". To determine
the amount of the interest to be charged on your Account we first calculate the
""Balance Subject to Interest Rate"" separately for Purchases, for Balance
Transfers, and for Cash Advances.  We apply the applicable DPR to each of the
applicable daily balances for  i) Purchases, ii) Balance Transfers and iii)
Cash Advances.  The daily balances for Purchases, for Balance Transfers and for
Cash Advances are each calculated separately and determined as follows: We take
the beginning balances for each transaction type on your Account each day,
including any interest calculated on the previous day's balance, add to the
respective balances any new transaction, subtract any payments or credits and
make any other applicable adjustment(s). This Agreement provides for
compounding of interest. A credit balance is treated as a balance of zero. If
you multiply the ""Balance Subject to Interest Rate"" for each balance category
as shown on your monthly billing statement by the number of days in the billing
period and then multiply each sum by the applicable DPRs, the results will be
the interest assessed, except for minor variations caused by rounding.  We may
from time to time offer you ""introductory,"" ""special"" or ""promotional"" APR
offers. If any are in effect on your Account  we will separately identify the
balances to which such offers apply on your monthly billing statement. These
separate balances and the related interest will be calculated in the same
manner as described above.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance Subject to Interest Rate (For Residents of
Iowa at the Time of Account Opening):

We use a method called ""average daily balance (including new purchases)"".  To
determine the amount of the interest to be charged on your Account we first
calculate the ""Balance Subject to Interest Rate"" separately for Purchases, for
Balance Transfers, and for Cash Advances.  We apply the applicable Monthly
Periodic Rate to the average daily balances of i) Purchases, ii) Balance
Transfers, and iii) Cash Advances. The average daily balances for Purchases,
for Balance Transfers, and for Cash Advances are calculated separately and
determined as follows:  We take the beginning balances for each balance
category on your Account each day, add to the respective balances any new
transaction, subtract any payments or credits and make any other applicable
adjustment(s). A credit balance is treated as a balance of zero. Then we take
the sum of all daily balances and divide by the number of days in the billing
period to determine the average daily balance. If you multiply the ""Balance
Subject to Interest Rate"" for each balance category as disclosed on your
monthly billing statement by the applicable MPRs, the results will be the
interest assessed, except for minor variations caused by rounding.  We may from
time to time offer you ""introductory,"" ""special"" or ""promotional"" APR offers.
If any are in effect on your Account  we will separately identify the balances
to which such offers apply on your monthly billing statement. These separate
balances and the related interest will be calculated in the same manner as
described above.

Accrual of Interest and How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases.

On Purchases, interest begins to accrue as of the transaction date. However,
you may avoid paying interest on Purchases in any given billing cycle if you
pay your Statement Balance in full by the Payment Due Date each month.  For
Balance Transfers, interest will accrue from the day we send the Balance
Transfer to the payee.  For Checks, interest will accrue on the day the payee
accepts the Check.  For Cash Advances, interest will accrue from the day you
take the Cash Advance.  If you are charged interest in a billing cycle, we will
charge a Minimum Interest Charge (or ""Minimum Charge"") on your Account if the
total interest charge in that billing cycle is less than the amount of the
Minimum Interest Charge that is disclosed in the Account Summary Table.

Using Your Account/Acceptance of These Terms.

You do not need to accept the Account and this Agreement and none of the fees
on this Account (except as otherwise provided herein) will apply unless you use
the Account.  If your Account has an Annual Fee (see the Account Summary Table
to determine if this Account has an Annual Fee) and provided that you have not
otherwise used the Account to make a Purchase, Balance Transfer or Cash Advance
or paid the Annual Fee, you may close the Account within thirty days after
Account opening by contacting us at the number on the back of your Card, and if
you do, you will not be responsible for paying the Annual Fee.  By signing,
keeping, using or otherwise accepting your Card or Account, you agree to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. You may obtain credit in the form of
Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances by using your Card, your account
number, Checks, or other credit devices. You agree that we may credit your
Account rather than issue cash refunds when you reverse transactions that were
originally charged to your Account. You agree that you will not use your Card
or Account in connection with any transaction that is prohibited or
unenforceable and that if you do engage in such a transaction you waive any
claim that the charge is uncollectible on the grounds the transaction was
prohibited or unenforceable. The Card must be returned to us upon request. We
may replace your Card with another Card at anytime.

Obligations on Your Account.

You authorize us to pay and charge your Account for all Purchases, Balance
Transfers, Checks, and Cash Advances made or obtained by you or anyone you
authorize to use your Card or Account. You agree to pay us for all of these
Purchases, Balance Transfers, Checks, and Cash Advances, plus any interest
assessed on your Account and any other charges and fees which you may owe under
the terms of this Agreement, whether resulting from 1) physical use of your
Card or a Check, 2) mail order or telephone, computer or other electronic
transaction made without presenting the Card, or 3) any other circumstances
where you authorize a charge, or authorize someone else to make a charge, to
your Account.  Each person who has agreed to be responsible on the Account is
responsible to pay the full amount owed on the Account.  If this is a joint
Account, we can send statements and notices to either of you. We may require
that you pay the full amount owed without first asking any other person(s) to
pay. Instructions for making payments are on your monthly billing statement.
Payments that comply with the requirements specified on or with your monthly
billing statement, including the time of receipt, will be credited on the
business day they are received. Payments must be mailed to the correct P.O. Box
or street address specified for U.S. Priority Mail and overnight payments.
There may be a delay of up to five (5) days in crediting payments that are not
made in accordance with those instructions.  Please allow at least seven (7)
days for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver your payment.  All payments must be
made in U.S. dollars. Any payment made by check or other negotiable instrument
or direct debit must be drawn on a U.S. bank or a U.S. branch of a foreign
bank. We reserve the right to accept payments made in a foreign currency. If we
do, we will select the foreign currency rate at our discretion.  Your available
credit may not be immediately increased by the amount of the payment for up to
seven (7) days to ensure we collect the funds from the bank on which your
payment is drawn.  If you overpay or if there is a credit balance on your
Account, we will not pay interest on such amounts.

Credit Line/Authorized Usage.

Your credit line is shown on the folder containing your Card. We may change
your credit line from time to time-either increase or decrease it-in our sole
discretion.  If at any time (including in the first month after your Account is
opened) you engage in account actions or activity that we perceive could have a
negative impact on your credit standing with us, we may decrease your credit
line or close your Account. Your latest credit line will appear on your monthly
billing statement.  You agree not to make a Purchase, authorize a Balance
Transfer, use a Check, or obtain a Cash Advance that would cause the unpaid
balance of your Account to exceed your credit line. We may honor Purchases,
Balance Transfers, Checks and/or Cash Advances in excess of your credit line at
our sole discretion. If we do, this Agreement applies to that excess and you
agree to pay the excess immediately if we request that you do so. You agree
that we may change or cancel your credit line at any time for any reason
without affecting your obligation to pay amounts that you owe under this
Agreement.  We will notify you of any change, but the change may take effect
before you receive the notice.  We may designate that only a portion of your
credit line is available for Cash Advances.  If we do and you exceed your line,
you will be considered to have exceeded your credit line for all purposes of
this Agreement. We may limit the authorizations to make Purchase, Balance
Transfer, Check, or Cash Advance transactions that may be accomplished with
your Card or Account.  If you are approved for an account that does not have a
preset spending limit please see the Addendum to the Cardmember Agreement
addendum for additional information about your credit line and the usage of
your Account.

Checks on Your Account.

We may issue Checks on your Account in the form of ""Balance Transfer Checks"" or
""Cash Advance Checks,"" which can be used to access your credit line.  Each
Check will contain your Account number and may be used only by the person(s)
whose name(s) is/are printed on it.  Each must be completed and signed in the
same manner as a regular personal check. If we provide Checks to you, you may
not use them to pay any amount you owe under this Agreement or under any other
account you may have with us. Balance Transfer Checks and Cash Advance Checks
are subject to the same rate and other terms under this Agreement as Balance
Transfers and Cash Advances, respectively.  Unless otherwise indicated, all
references in this Agreement to Balance Transfers include Balance Transfer
Checks, all references to Cash Advances include Cash Advance Checks, and all
references to use of the Account include use of these Checks. At our sole
discretion we may elect to not honor a Check if there has been a change in your
credit worthiness, your account is not in good standing or if the Check may
cause your account to exceed the Cash Advance or other applicable credit line
on your Account. At our sole discretion we may elect to honor a Check after its
expiration date. Unlike purchase transactions, there are no charge back rights
with regard to Balance Transfer and Check transactions.

Monthly Billing Statements.

At the end of each monthly billing cycle a statement will be mailed or
delivered to you if your Account has a debit or credit balance of more than
$1.00 or if interest or a fee has been imposed. We will not send a monthly
billing statement if we deem your Account uncollectible or if delinquency
collection proceedings have been instituted by us sending your Account to an
outside collection agency or attorney for collection.

Your Minimum Payment Each Month.

Each billing cycle, you must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due shown on your
monthly statement by its Payment Due Date.  If the Statement Balance shown on
your monthly statement is less than $20, your Minimum Payment Due (due by the
Payment Due Date) will be that Statement Balance amount. Otherwise, if your
Statement Balance is equal to or greater than $20, your Minimum Payment Due
will be the greater of $20 or the total of (1) 1% of the Principal Balance
(defined as the total Statement Balance minus any interest charges, Returned
Payment Fees, and Late Payment Fees that are incurred during the current
billing cycle), plus (2) interest charges incurred during the current billing
cycle (for this purpose, interest charges incurred do not include interest
charges that accrued during prior billing cycles on a deferred interest balance
(if there are any on your Account) that ended during the billing cycle covered
by the statement), plus (3) any Returned Payment Fees and any Late Payment Fees
incurred during the current billing cycle, plus (4) if we so elect, any amount
past due and/or amount over your credit line at the time of billing. In certain
instances your Minimum Payment Due may be less than your total fees and
interest assessed in that billing cycle. At any time you may pay more than the
Minimum Payment Due up to the full amount you owe us, however you cannot ""pay
ahead"".  This means that if you pay more than the required Minimum Payment Due
in any billing cycle or if you make more than one payment in a billing cycle,
you will still need to pay the next month's required Minimum Payment Due by
your next Payment Due Date.

Transaction Fees.

If you use your Card or Account to obtain a Cash Advance, we will charge a Cash
Advance Fee  for each such Cash Advance. If you use your Card or Account to do
a Balance Transfer, we will charge a Balance Transfer Fee for each such Balance
Transfer. If you use your Card or Account to purchase Cash Equivalents, we will
charge a Cash Advance Fee (sometimes we may refer to this as a Cash Equivalent
Fee) for each such transaction. If you use your Card or Account for a Foreign
Transaction, we will charge a Foreign Transaction Fee for each such
transaction.  Balance Transfer Checks and Cash Advance Checks are subject to
the same Transaction Fee as Balance Transfers and Cash Advances, respectively.
The present amounts of those charges are stated in the Account Summary Table

Account Fees.
In addition to the fees listed in the Account Summary Table, we may also assess
the Account Fees listed below.

Annual Fee  - If your account has an Annual Fee, generally it will be billed at
account opening and every twelve months thereafter. The amount of the Annual
Fee, if there is one on your Account, is listed in the Account Summary Table.

VISA CLASSIC AND VISA PLATINUM 
CONSUMER CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT 

In this Agreement, �Agreement� means this Consumer Credit Card Agreement. �Disclosure� means the Credit Card 
Account Opening Disclosure. The Account Opening Disclosure is incorporated into this Consumer Credit Card Agreement 
and is part of the Agreement. In this Agreement the words ""you,"" �your,� and ""yours"" mean each and all of those who 
agree to be bound by this Agreement; ""card"" means the Visa credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the 
Credit Union issues to you; ""account"" means your Visa credit card line-of-credit account with the Credit Union; and ""Credit 
Union"" means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers 
this Agreement. 

1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT � If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. 
You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other 
charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will 
not allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that 
exceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or 
electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled �Statements and Notices�) explaining your right 
to opt in to the Credit Union�s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in 
to such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a 
method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an 
advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain 
cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your 
account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience 
check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check 
drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. 
You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee 
imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request 
orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the 
check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately 
describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the 
exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 
14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six 

(6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be 
renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a 
check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the 
payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any 
legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, 
damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result 
of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. 
2. USING YOUR CARD � You understand that the use of your credit card will constitute acknowledgement of receipt 
and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You 
may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not 
responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or 
services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted 
to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial 
institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If 
the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To 
obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will 
not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card 
for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If 
you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and 
engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash 
advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery tickets, and casino gaming chips. 
This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal. 
3. PROMISE TO PAY � You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of 
convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You 
also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or 
�CUNA MUTUAL GROUP, 1991, 2006, 09, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DNYII0 (MXC500 CCM000)-e 


another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also 
applies to your account. 

4. PERIODIC RATES � The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are 
disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a 
payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to 
applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on 
purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure 
accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory 
discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an 
Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure 
accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to 
the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement. 
5. FINANCE CHARGES � New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge 
for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new 
balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge 
will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of 
purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A 
finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the 
billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later. 
The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is 
computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of 
purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any 
payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases 
for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily 
balance of purchases. 

For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash 
advances. To get the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash 
advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash 
advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. Then, we add all the daily balances of cash 
advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the 
average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances. 

6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS � Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your 
account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing 
international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the 
applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated 
rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from 
the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. 
A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, cash 
advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes 
on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or 

U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
7. FEES � In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to 
your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your 
account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
a. Card Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to the Card Replacement Fee, a fee will be added to your account 
for each replacement card that is issued to you for any reason. 
b. Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance 
charge), a fee may be added to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency. 
Transactions made in a foreign currency using a Visa branded card or processed by a network operated or affiliated with 
Visa will be subject to a fee as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
c. Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be added to your account when you 
do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set forth 
on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 
d. Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be added to your account 
when a payment is returned to you for any reason. 
e. Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and 
when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the credit union, a fee may be added to your account 
for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request. 
f. Rush Fee. If your account is subject to a Rush Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be added to your 
account for each rush card that you request, providing delivery of the card is also available by standard mail service, 
without paying a fee for delivery.

8. PAYMENTS � Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date 
specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new 
balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each 
month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). For our Visa Classic, the minimum payment is 2.00% of 
your total new balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have 
not made, and any amount you are over your credit limit. For our Visa Platinum, the minimum payment is 2.00% of your 
total new balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not 
made, and any amount you are over your credit limit. In addition to the minimum payment, you must also pay, by the date 
specified above, the amount of any prior minimum payment(s) that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and 
charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate 
payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. 
9. PAYMENT ALLOCATION � Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit 
Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of 
the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the 
highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable 
annual percentage rate. 
10. SECURITY INTEREST � You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and 
under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a 
specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may 
not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release 
all or part of the pledged amount. 
Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union,
except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special taxtreatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you arein default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or jointshare accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default. 
Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never 
be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement. 

11. DEFAULT � You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date 
that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you 
die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in 
default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default 
if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. 
When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance 
without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the 
periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for 
your account may be applied towards what you owe. 

12. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION � You agree to notify us 
immediately, orally or in writing, at Attn: Customer Service, PO Box 3112, Tampa, FL 33631-3112 or telephone (800) 4497728 
seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day, (800) 221-7728 Hearing Impaired seven (7) days a week, 24 hours a day or 
(800) 468-5500 Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. EST, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit 
card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that 
occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized 
purchases made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your 
liability will not exceed $50.00. 
13. CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT � As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms 
of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with 
applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account 
balance as well as to future transactions. 
Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will 
not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. 
Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject 
to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions 
made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized. 

The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit 
Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint 
account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account. 

14. CHANGING OR TERMINATING AUTHORIZED USERS � Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for 
authorized users that you designate. You must notify us in writing of any termination of an authorized user's right to 
access your account. Your letter must include the name of the authorized user and your account number and/or any 
subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's card and any convenience or other 
DNYII0 (MXC500 CCM000)-e 


access checks issued to the authorized user. If you cannot return the authorized user's card or access checks and if you 
request your account to be closed, we will close your account and you may apply for a new account. 

15. CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION � You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit 
standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your 
account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing. If your account is eligible for emergency 
cash and/or emergency card replacement services, and you request such services, you agree that we may provide 
personal information about you and your account that is necessary to provide you with the requested service(s). 
16. RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS � Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or 
adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your 
credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and 
cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or 
automatically after six (6) months. 
17. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS � The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional 
services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit 
Union is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time. 
18. MERCHANT DISPUTES � The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution 
to honor your card. The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or 
services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction 
from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union 
sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made in your state or within 
100 miles of your home. 
19. JOINT ACCOUNTS � If this is a joint account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all 
amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay 
the entire amount owed under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases or cash advances 
individually. Any one of you may terminate the account and the termination will be effective as to all of you. 
20. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT � This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even 
though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms. 
21. NO WAIVER � The Credit Union can delay enforcing any of its rights any number of times without losing them. 
22. STATEMENTS AND NOTICES � Statements and notices will be mailed to you at the appropriate address you have 
given the Credit Union. Notice sent to any one of you will be considered notice to all. 
23. SEVERABILITY AND FINAL EXPRESSION � This Agreement and the Disclosure are the final expression of the 
terms and conditions of your account. This written Agreement and Disclosure may not be contradicted by evidence of any 
alleged oral agreement. Should any part of this Agreement or the Disclosure be found to be invalid or unenforceable, all

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement 

If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at: 

Attn: Customer Service 

PO Box 3112 

Tampa, FL 33631-3112 
In your letter, give us the following information: 

� 
Account information: Your name and account number. 
� 
Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
� 
Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you 
believe it is a mistake. 
You must contact us: 

� 
Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. 
� 
At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount 
you think is wrong. 
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to 
investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. 

What Will Happen After We Receive Your LetterWhen we receive your letter, we must do two things: 

1. 
Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we 
have already corrected the error. 
2. 
Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is 
correct. 
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:

� 
We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
� 
The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that 
amount. 
� 
While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. 
� 
We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. 
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 

� 
If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that 
amount. 
� 
If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable 
interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may 
then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. 
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still 
refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. 
We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know 
when the matter has been settled between us. 

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is 
correct. 

Your Rights if You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases

If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in 
good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the 
purchase. 

To use this right, all of the following must be true: 

1. 
The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and 
the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was 
based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 
2. 
You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with 
a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at: 
Attn: Customer Service 
PO Box 3112 
Tampa, FL 33631-3112 
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, 
we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as 
delinquent.

DEFINITIONS.  In this Agreement, the reference to ""We"", ""Us"", ""Our"" and ""Credit Union"" mean DFCU FINANCIAL. The words ""You"" and ""Your"" mean each person who accepts this Agreement or uses the VISA Platinum Credit Card. The words ""Card"" and ""Credit Card"" mean any VISA Platinum Credit Card issued to You by Us and any duplicates or renewals. ""Convenience Checks"" mean the special Account access devices that We may provide for Your use from time to time. If this is a joint Account, read singular pronouns in the plural. 


PROMISE TO PAY. You understand that the following terms and conditions constitute Our Agreement with You. Your account may be accessible through a variety of means which could include advance request forms, vouchers, checks, charge slips, convenience checks, Credit Cards and the like. Regardless of the access means, You promise to pay Us all amounts charged to Your account by You or by any user who has access to Your account, with actual, apparent or implied authority for use of Your account, including Finance Charges and other fees or charges described herein.

USE OF YOUR CARD. You may use Your Card to buy goods and services in any place that it is honored and to get cash advances at participating financial institutions. You agree not to use Your Card for illegal transactions including, but not limited to, advances made for the purpose of gambling and/or wagering where such practices are in violation of applicable state and/or federal law. Cash advance amounts may be limited. Contact Us for any limitation that may apply to You.

SECURITY. You acknowledge that You own any shares and/or collateral pledged as security and that there are no other liens against them other than Ours. You agree to perform all acts which are necessary to make Our security interest in the shares and/or collateral being pledged enforceable.

OTHER SECURITY. Collateral (other than household goods or any dwelling) given as security under this Agreement or for any other loan You may have with Us will secure all amounts You owe Us now and in the future if that status is reflected in the ""Truth-in-Lending Disclosure"" in any particular Agreement evidencing such debt.     

LIEN ON SHARES. You grant and consent to a lien on Your shares with Us (except for IRA and Keogh accounts) and any dividends due or to become due to You from Us to the extent You owe on any unpaid Credit Card balance.

LINE OF CREDIT LIMITS. You will be notified of each specific Credit Limit for which You are approved. Unless You are in default, any Credit Limits established for You will generally be self-replenishing as You make payments.

You will keep Your unpaid balance within Your Credit Limit set by Us, and You will pay any amount over Your Credit Limit on Our demand whether or not We authorize the advances which caused You to exceed Your Credit Limit. Even if Your unpaid balance is less than Your Credit Limit, You will have no credit available during any time that any aspect of Your account is in default.

JOINT ACCOUNTS. Each Borrower will be responsible, jointly and severally, for the repayment of any amounts owed. You understand that any Account access device, such as a Personal Identification Number (PIN) will be mailed only to the primary Borrower at the address that We have on file for You. We may refuse to follow any instructions which run counter to this provision.

MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENTS (PAYMENT SCHEDULE). Though You need only pay the Minimum Monthly Payments, You understand that You have the right to repay at any time without penalty. You also understand that You will only be charged periodic Finance Charges to the date You repay Your entire balance. You may make larger payments without penalty. Any partial payment or prepayment will not delay Your next scheduled payment. All payments to Us must be in lawful money of the United States. As permitted by law, the order in which We may apply payments is at Our discretion.

Any unpaid portion of the Finance Charge will be paid by subsequent payments and will not be added to Your principal balance. You understand that any delay in the repayment of Your unpaid balance will increase Your periodic Finance Charges and any acceleration in the repayment of Your unpaid balance will decrease Your periodic Finance Charges.

Minimum Payments will be an amount equal to 2.00% of Your new unpaid balance at the end of each billing cycle, subject to the lesser of $10.00 or Your balance, plus any portion of the Minimum Payments shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid, plus any amount that exceeds Your approved Credit Limit.

You may, by separate agreement, authorize Us to charge Your payment directly to Your share or share draft account.

LATE CHARGE. If Your payment is 15 or more days late, You will be charged $25. 

OTHER FEES AND CHARGES. You will be charged the following fees associated with the use of Your Card: (a) $28 for any check (or other negotiable instrument used for payment) which is returned unpaid; (b) during any 12-consecutive-month period, You will be charged $10 for the first replacement Card You request and $20 for each replacement Card You request thereafter; and (c) $5 for each statement copy You request.

FINANCE CHARGES. In the case of any transactions, the balances subject to the periodic Finance Charge are the average daily transactions balances outstanding during the month (new and previous). To get the average daily balance, We take the beginning balance of Your account each day, add any new purchases, cash advances, insurance premiums, debit adjustments or other charges and subtract any payments, credits and unpaid Finance Charges. This gives Us the daily balance. Then, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by multiplying the average daily balance subject to a Finance Charge by the Monthly Periodic Rate.

You can avoid Finance Charges on purchases by paying the full amount of the entire balance owed each month within 25 days of Your statement closing date. Otherwise, the new balance of purchases, and subsequent purchases from the date they are posted to Your account, will be subject to a Finance Charge. Cash advances and balance transfers are always subject to a Finance Charge from the later of the date they are posted to Your account or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your account.

For the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate and corresponding annual percentage rate, refer to the separate page titled ""Additional Disclosure - Federal Truth-In-Lending Act"" which We have included with and made a part of this Agreement.

PERIODIC STATEMENTS. On a regular basis, You will receive a statement showing all transactions on Your account including amounts paid and borrowed since Your last statement. We will mail You a statement each month in which there is a debit or credit balance or when a Finance Charge is imposed. We need not send You a statement if We feel Your account is uncollectible or if We have started collection proceedings against You because You defaulted. Each statement is deemed to be a correct statement of account unless You establish a billing error pursuant to the Federal Truth-In-Lending Act. 

OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO HONOR CONVENIENCE CHECKS. We are under no obligation to honor Your Convenience Checks if: (1) by paying a Convenience Check, You would exceed Your Credit Limit; (2) Your Cards or Convenience Checks have been reported lost or stolen; (3) Your account has been cancelled or has expired. If a postdated Convenience Check is paid and, as a result, any other Convenience Check is returned unpaid, We are not responsible for any resulting loss or liability.

DEFAULT. You will be in default if: (a) You do not make any payment or perform any obligation under this Agreement, or any other agreement that You may have with Us; or (b) You should die, become involved in any insolvency, receivership or custodial proceeding brought by or against You; or (c) You have made a false or misleading statement in Your credit application and/or in Your representations to Us while You owe money on Your account; or (d) A judgment or tax lien should be filed against You or any attachment or garnishment should be issued against any of Your property or rights, specifically including anyone  starting an action or proceeding to seize any of Your funds on deposit with Us; and/or (e) We should, in good faith, believe Your ability to repay Your indebtedness hereunder is or soon will be impaired, time being of the very essence.

Upon any occurrence of default, We may, to the extent permitted by law, cancel Your rights under this Agreement, require the return of all access devices and declare the entire balance of Your account immediately due and payable, without prior notice or demand. 

COLLECTION COSTS. In the event collection efforts are required to obtain payment on this account, to the extent permitted by law, You agree to pay all court costs, private process server fees, investigation fees or other costs incurred in collection and actual attorneys' fees incurred in the course of collecting any amounts owed under this Agreement or in the recovery of any collateral.

ENFORCEMENT. We do not lose Our rights under this or any related agreement if We delay enforcing them. We can accept late payments, partial payments or any other payments, even if they are marked ""paid in full"" without losing any of Our rights under this Agreement. If any provision of this or any related agreement is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, all other provisions remain in full force and effect.

NOTIFICATION OF ADDRESS CHANGE. You will notify Us promptly if You move or otherwise have a change of address.

CHANGE IN TERMS. We may change the terms of this Agreement by mailing or delivering to You written notice of the changes as prescribed by the Federal Truth-In-Lending Act. To the extent permitted by law, the right to change the terms of this Agreement includes, but is not limited to, the right to change the periodic rate applicable to Your unpaid balance and/or future advances.

CREDIT INSURANCE. Credit insurance is not required for any extension of credit under this Agreement. However, You may purchase any credit insurance available through Us and have the premiums added to Your outstanding balance. If You elect to do so, You will be given the necessary disclosures and documents separately.

INTEGRATED DOCUMENTS. Any separate sheet of paper labeled ""Additional Disclosure - Federal Truth-In-Lending Act"", which is delivered together with this Agreement or at a later date becomes an integrated part of this Agreement.

CONSENT TO AGREEMENT. You acknowledge receipt of a copy of this Agreement. By signing the application; or by using Your account or any account access device; or by authorizing another to use Your account, You agree to and accept its terms.

UPDATING AND DISCLOSING FINANCIAL INFORMATION. You will provide facts to update information contained in Your original account application or other financial information related to You, at Our request. You also agree that We may, from time to time, as We deem necessary, make inquiries pertaining to Your employment, credit standing and financial responsibility in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. You further agree that We may give information about the status and payment history of Your account to consumer credit reporting agencies, a prospective employer or insurer, or a state or federal licensing agency having any apparent legitimate business need for such information. 

TERMINATION. Either You or We may cancel Your Credit Card, at any time, whether or not You are in default. You will, in any case, remain liable to pay any unpaid balances according to the terms of Your account.

GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is controlled and governed by the laws of the State of Michigan except to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with controlling federal law.

OWNERSHIP. Your Card remains Our property and may be cancelled by Us at any time without notice. You agree to surrender Your Card and to discontinue its use immediately upon Our request.

ISSUANCE OF A PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. We will issue a Personal Identification Number (PIN) for use with participating ATMs. This PIN is confidential and should not be disclosed to anyone. You may use Your PIN to access Your account and all sums advanced will be added to Your account balance. In the event a use of Your PIN constitutes an Electronic Fund Transfer, the terms and conditions of Your Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement may also affect Your rights. 

EFFECT OF AGREEMENT. Even though the sales, cash advance, credit or other slips You may sign or receive when using Your Card contain terms, this Agreement is the contract which solely applies to all transactions involving the Card.

UNAUTHORIZED USE. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of Your Card. You will not be liable for the unauthorized use that occurs after You notify Us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use by calling (800) 654-7728 or by writing to: P.O. Box 31112, Tampa, Florida 33631-3112. In any case, Your liability will not exceed $50.

REFUSAL TO HONOR CARDS OR CONVENIENCE CHECKS. We are not liable for the refusal or inability of merchants, financial institutions and others to accept the Cards or Convenience Checks, or electronic terminals to honor the Cards or complete a Card withdrawal, or for their retention of the Cards or Convenience Checks.

FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS. For transactions initiated in foreign countries and foreign currencies, the exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency (U.S. dollars) will be: (a) a rate selected by VISA from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives; or (b) the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. 
For all transactions, You will be charged 1.00% calculated on the final settlement amount. 

TRANSACTION SLIPS. Your monthly statement will identify that merchant, electronic terminal or financial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement.

LOST CARDS OR CONVENIENCE CHECKS. To report lost or stolen Credit Cards or Convenience Checks, You will immediately call (800) 654-7728 or write to: P.O. Box 31112, Tampa, Florida 33631-3112. 
 
CREDITS. If a merchant who honors Your Card gives You credit for returns or adjustments, they will do so by sending Us a slip which will be posted to Your account. If Your credits and payments exceed what You owe Us, We will hold and apply this credit against future purchases and cash advances, or if it is $1.00 or more refund it on Your written request or automatically deposit it to Your share account after six months.  
     
YOUR BILLING RIGHTS KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE

This notice contains important information about Your rights and Our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

NOTIFY US IN CASE OF ERRORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR STATEMENT

If You think Your statement is wrong, or if You need more information about a transaction on Your statement, write Us on a separate sheet, at P.O. Box 31112, Tampa, Florida 33631-3112. Write to Us as soon as possible. We must hear from You no later than 60 days after We sent You the first statement on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone Us, but doing so will not preserve Your rights.

In Your letter, give Us the following information:
- 	Your Name and account number.
- 	Dollar amount of the suspected error.
- 	Describe the error and explain, if You can, why You believe there is an error. If You need more information, describe the item You are not sure about.

If You have authorized Us to pay Your bill automatically from Your share or share draft account, You can stop the payment on any amount You think is wrong. To stop the payment, Your letter must reach Us at P.O. Box 6048, Dearborn, MI 48121, three business days before the automatic payment is scheduled to occur.

YOUR RIGHTS AND OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AFTER WE RECEIVE YOUR WRITTEN NOTICE

We must acknowledge Your letter within 30 days, unless We have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, We must either correct the error or explain why We believe the statement is correct.

After We receive Your letter, We cannot try to collect any amount You question, or report You as delinquent. We can continue to bill You for the amount You question, including Finance Charges, and We can apply any unpaid amount against Your Credit Limit. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while We are investigating, but You are still obligated to pay the parts of Your statement that are not in question.

If We find that We made a mistake on Your statement, You will not have to pay any Finance Charges related to any questioned amount. If We didn't make a mistake, You may have to pay Finance Charges, and You will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, We will send You a statement of the amount You owe and the date that it is due.

If You fail to pay the amount that We think You owe, We may report You as delinquent. However, if Our explanation does not satisfy You and You write to Us within 10 days telling Us that You still refuse to pay, We must tell anyone We reported You to that You have a question about Your statement and We must tell You the name of anyone We reported You to. We must tell anyone We reported You to that the matter has been settled between Us when it finally is.

If We don't follow these rules, We can't collect the first $50 of the questioned amount, even if Your statement is correct.

SPECIAL RULE FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES

If You have a problem with the quality of property or services that You purchased with a Credit Card, and You have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, You may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or services. There are two limitations on this right:

a.	You must have made the purchase in Your home state, or, if not within Your home state, within 100 miles of Your current mailing address; and

b.	The purchase price must have been more than $50.

These limitations do not apply if We own or operate the merchant, or if We mailed You the advertisement for the property or services.

FINANCE CHARGES. In the case of any transactions, the balances subject to the periodic Finance Charge are the average daily transactions balances outstanding during the month (new and previous). To get the average daily balance, We take the beginning balance of Your account each day, add any new purchases, cash advances, insurance premiums, debit adjustments or other charges and subtract any payments, credits and unpaid Finance Charges. This gives Us the daily balance. Then, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by multiplying the average daily balance subject to a Finance Charge by the Monthly Periodic Rate.

You can avoid Finance Charges on purchases by paying the full amount of the entire balance owed each month within 25 days of Your statement closing date. Otherwise, the new balance of purchases, and subsequent purchases from the date they are posted to Your account, will be subject to a Finance Charge. Cash advances and balance transfers are always subject to a Finance Charge from the later of the date they are posted to Your account or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your account. 

The Monthly Periodic Rate that will apply to Your unpaid VISA Platinum balance will be 0.8250% - 1.4083% (corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 9.90% - 16.90%), based on Your creditworthiness at the time You open Your Account.
